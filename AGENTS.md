# AGENTS — Runtime Doctrine and Entry

An agent is an LLM operating with instructions, supplied context, available
tools, and actual host permissions. A role describes how the agent contributes;
a workflow describes how an undertaking is performed. The human remains
accountable for what is accepted or relied upon.

## Roles

| Role | Type | Contribution |
|---|---|---|
| HELP_HUMAN | 0 | Work with the human on alignment, continuity, and coordination |
| HELPS_HUMANS | 1 | Conceive and design workflows, tools, and projects with the human |
| WORKING_ITEMS | 1 | Organize implementation, assign bounded work, and integrate results |
| TASK | 2 | Execute one bounded assignment, using a workflow when selected |

The human may enter through an untyped session or directly select HELP_HUMAN,
HELPS_HUMANS, or WORKING_ITEMS. TASK is a delegated executor. Ordinary selective
context consists of this Root `AGENTS.md`, applicable project instructions, the
active role's `agents/AGENT_<ROLE>.md`, and available skill names and
descriptions. It excludes other full role instructions, broad governance texts,
and unselected workflow or skill bodies. Load selected or needed bodies and
resources on demand. Record their actual origins and hashes in governed run
evidence so later inspection and replay can reconstruct the supplied history.
A role may consult another role's instructions deliberately when comparison,
design, migration, or coordination actually requires it, and must record that
wider consultation in the run evidence.

HELP_HUMAN may coordinate the two managers or dispatch bounded Type 2 work
directly. HELPS_HUMANS and WORKING_ITEMS may dispatch TASK or an ephemeral Type
2 instance. Type 2 does not delegate. Agents may investigate, draft, propose,
check, and carry authorized work forward on their own initiative. They return
to the human for decisions reserved by the governing workflow or accepted
instruments; uncertainty alone does not require an extra prompt.

## Skills and workflows

A skill is reusable bounded contextual instruction with a canonical `SKILL.md`;
it may contain a simple method or a complex set of supporting resources. A
workflow is reusable coordination or method guidance for an undertaking; it
may also be simple or complex, and selecting one is optional unless an accepted
instrument requires it. Neither creates a role, expands authority, or proves
that a tool is available.

Root and standalone compatibility interfaces may discover project skills at
`.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and user skills at
`~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Ordinary App skill resolution is narrower:
only the App-supplied reviewed bundled skill library is trusted for agent
context.
Project and user skill definitions remain readable standalone-compatibility
inputs and historical origins, but the ordinary App catalog does not discover
or activate them, whether or not their files still exist. Read-only replay may
render preserved historical bytes and origin without activating the skill for a
new turn. Continuing from such a selection requires an explicit drop or change
to an eligible bundled skill; it is never silently rebound to a same-named
bundled definition.

Project workflows live at `.chirality/workflows/<name>/WORKFLOW.md`; user
workflows at `~/.chirality/workflows/<name>/WORKFLOW.md`; the App may also
supply bundled, reviewed workflows. Root's `workflows/` packages are the
current bundled source tree. Workflow lookup order for an unqualified name is
project, then user, then bundled. Selection retains the source-qualified
identity. Expose every colliding workflow origin, and never let later discovery
silently replace an already selected workflow.

Ordinary App context may include bundled skill names and descriptions. Load a
skill body and its resources only when selected or needed. Select a workflow
with `Workflow: <name>` or its source-qualified identity and load only its
entrypoint and resources needed for the current stage. Consult the generated
Root `workflows/index.json`, or Runtime's effective catalog when available,
when a reusable established method may help and the correct method is not
already known. Inspect the chosen descriptor and source before loading its
body. Routine role context does not carry full workflow bodies. Legacy
`TaskSkill` input is resolved by the compatibility adapter without erasing its
historical identity.

The central project workflows are shown first because they are broadly
applicable. This attention does not require their use:

| Undertaking | Workflow |
|---|---|
| Workspace initialization and setup pipelines | `project-setup` |
| Project scope decomposition | `project-decomp` |
| Software decomposition | `software-decomp` |
| Domain and knowledge decomposition | `domain-decomp` |
| Research stream orchestration and synthesis | `research-orchestration` |
| Amendment and consequence propagation | `scope-change` |

Other workflows remain available through deliberate discovery. A workflow may
compose deterministic tools and bounded TASK assignments while preserving its
own human checkpoints and output contract.

A user may ask in the active chat to create, save, or revise a workflow. The
agent prepares a valid `.chirality/workflows/<name>/WORKFLOW.md` project package
or `~/.chirality/workflows/<name>/WORKFLOW.md` user package through authorized
file tools, adds only the resources the method needs, validates package metadata
and containment, and refreshes the Runtime catalog. This conversational path is
the ordinary authoring experience; the App does not require or provide a
separate workflow editor.

## Tools, briefs, and ad hoc plans

A tool performs a deterministic operation. Documentation states how it should
be used; actual availability and enforcement come from the running host. An
agent should use an available tool when it can perform an authorized operation
reliably, and should report the real execution boundary rather than infer one
from prose or metadata.

Run-specific instructions, including an ordinary conversational request, form
the brief. Structured briefs additionally record purpose, accepted basis,
context, permissions, write targets, outputs, acceptance checks, and return
path when the undertaking needs those fields. The effective boundary is the
intersection of actual host permissions, the role ceiling, any selected
method restrictions, and the brief. A declared capability or path never
grants access the host did not provide.

An active role may create an ad hoc plan whenever planning helps, whether or
not a named workflow exists. Plans are optional and may invoke workflows,
skills, tools, and authorized delegation. Keep a plan proportionate, record
material decisions and checks when the work needs durable evidence, and do not
present an ad hoc plan as a reusable or accepted workflow. Repeated ad hoc
methods are candidates for HELPS_HUMANS to develop into a workflow.

## Execution and governance

For `sgttomas/chirality`, the owner's standing Git authorization of 2026-09-12
permits current and subsequent agents to commit, push, open/update PRs, and merge
within authorized work without a separate approval for each Git operation.
Merge when required CI passes and independent review has no unresolved blocking
findings, with review and validation covering the actual candidate revision.
Reassess affected checks after changes; a passing rerun does not establish that
a known defect was repaired. Use the owner's configured Git/GitHub identity
(SSH for pushes where configured; authenticated GitHub CLI/API for PR merges),
preserve truthful authorship and agent attribution, and never imply personal
owner review. This grants no scope expansion, protection bypass, account or
repository permission changes, governed acceptance, or product release.
Explicit holds and later owner directions take precedence. The grant replaces
earlier per-merge approval defaults across this repository's project loops;
see [the merge policy](docs/PRD_ROOT.md#531-merge-gate-policy--the-d-8-successor)
and `.agents/skills/chirality-change/SKILL.md` for application and ordinary PR
records. Historical instructions and accepted evidence remain historical.

Executable delegation uses either Chirality-managed `delegate_agent` sessions
or delegated-harness-native descendants under D-GOV-35. Record the actual
mechanism, parentage, supplied basis, scopes, enforcement limits, and returns.
An executing child and a written launch brief are different facts.

For the App MVP, Codex is the sole engine qualification and release target.
Model choice within Codex does not create another engine. Historical sessions,
standalone compatibility records, and retained compatibility surfaces may name
other engines or providers, but they do not establish qualified MVP support and
never substitute for required Codex capability.

The shared governance is in `docs/DIRECTIVE.md`, `docs/CONTRACT.md`,
`docs/SPEC.md`, and `docs/TYPES.md`, with accepted amendments. Component design
is specified in `docs/WORKFLOW_COMPONENT_STANDARD.md`; runtime configuration,
loading, coordination, and adoption are specified in
`docs/AGENT_WORKFLOW_RUNTIME.md`. Applicable decomposition work also follows
`docs/DECOMPOSITION_STANDARD.md`.

Project and user instruction roots, path anchoring, and containment follow
`docs/SPEC.md` §0.2–0.3 and `docs/AGENT_WORKFLOW_RUNTIME.md`. Applicable project
instructions may specialize shared instructions but may not weaken Root
governance. The library lookup and source-qualified identity rules above govern
skill and workflow collisions.

Preserve authoritative identity, coverage, provenance, independent checking,
and closure across every workflow. Agents prepare proposals, comparisons, and
checks before a human checkpoint so the human decides a concrete reviewable
package. Mechanical or asset-quality evidence may route repair work but does
not itself create a new human prompt. When an accepted material basis changes,
reopen only the decisions whose warrants or consequences are affected, then
regenerate dependent evidence as required.

Instruction changes require their own authorized scope and tranche manifest.
Notify each affected project loop whose authority corpus or contract mirrors pin
changed instructions. Notices communicate changes; each receiving loop decides
its adoption and updates its own accepted basis.

This interface is a prospective Root implementation of the user-approved
Chirality v3 design. These bytes do not themselves establish final acceptance,
downstream qualification, public release, or adoption by another project loop.
Incompatible App and Runtime consumers remain on their accepted instruction
basis until their owning loops adopt a compatible interface. Root `CLAUDE.md`
imports this file.
