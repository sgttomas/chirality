# D-T0-07 — Contract versioning / pinning + DEC-041 confirmation  (RULED 2026-06-21)

**Decision:** Where does the cross-repo flow-A contract package version live and how is it pinned — and confirm DEC-041 as decision-of-record.

**Why the owner's:** cross-repo version governance is a maintainer decision; DEC-041's status needs confirmation.

**Verified facts:** `CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK_PACKAGE_VERSION='0.3.150'` (`frontend/src/lib/harness/sdk-version.ts`); `HARNESS_TOOL_REGISTRY_VERSION` (`frontend/src/lib/harness/tool-descriptor.ts:13`). **DEC-041 EXISTS** at piping `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md:611` (harness-as-versioned-packages; gated behind D-21 + an automation condition; 2026-06-18) — **refutes** app-dev's "no written DEC-041 text"; it was simply invisible from app-dev's tree.

**Options:** (a) tier-0-owned scheme that *references* both app-dev versions; (b) extend `CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK_PACKAGE_VERSION`; (c) extend `HARNESS_TOOL_REGISTRY_VERSION`.

**Recommendation:** (a) — neither repo's version owns the cross-repo contract; cross-reference DEC-041 (SHA-pinned) into app-dev so its Flow-A boundary is decision-backed, not import-graph-derived.

**Unblocks:** app-dev open-Q5; the DEC-041 consumable-package-pull automation condition. **Forecloses:** decision-unbacked package boundaries.
