# D-T0-29 — Exact whitespace attribute for D-T0-28 patch evidence

**Status:** `RULED O-A / APPLICATION VALIDATED / READY FOR CHANGE / NOT EFFECTIVE`

**Date presented:** 2026-08-02

**Decision ID:** D-T0-29

**Packet:**
`../bridge/D-T0-29_D-T0-28_PATCH_WHITESPACE_ATTRIBUTE_2026-08-02/PACKET.md`

**Exact `.gitattributes` preimage SHA-256:**
`7dece5526cb8dd98264bab5c96be95235cd482b1b1da4e623b63489dae1e1fe2`

**Exact proposed postimage SHA-256:**
`c0d9e5b7e3bbca1f41087959d6095e75d578fef172123050da7145f52fb9d89f`

## Named convention

Root `.gitattributes` already applies `-whitespace` to
`execution/_ScopeChange/**/*.diff` because unified-diff artifacts carry
format-mandated single-space blank context lines. D-T0-29 proposes the same
convention for exactly the ruled D-T0-28 patch path and no other file.

## Question and options

Authorize the exact one-line attribute without changing the ruled D-T0-28
patch or test bytes?

- **O-A — authorize exact attribute (recommended).** Only `.gitattributes`
  changes from the exact preimage to exact postimage, followed by every packet
  check.
- **O-B — defer.** Preserve all bytes and keep candidate-whitespace blocked.
- **O-C — amend or decline.** Requires a revised exact packet before any act.

## Authority fence

This row authorizes nothing while awaiting ruling. It changes no attribute,
validator, patch, test, profile, project, PEC path, source, ScopeOfWork,
lifecycle, Task Management, runtime, release, reliance, D-PEC-75 state, or
cross-loop duty. D-T0-27 and D-T0-28 remain not effective.

## Owner ruling

Ryan Tufts, in-session, 2026-08-02 (verbatim):

> APPROVE:
>
> 1. D-T0-29: O-A.
>
> 2. DEL-01-06 REVIEW Gate 5 — HOLD.
>
>    Retain DEL-01-06 at INITIALIZED. The SELF_CHECK populated
>    AC-001 through AC-006 as PENDING FUTURE PRODUCTION, recorded
>    zero findings, and recommends no lifecycle transition.
>
> 3. DEL-01-06 ScopeOfWork contract fitness — ACCEPT.
>
>    I accept ScopeOfWork.md at SHA-256
>    7dfa008b44d7425ab7e4fc47260d089c3d739416d666f52657d7093492ecf38a
>    as the production contract for DEL-01-06.
>
>    AC-001 through AC-006 remain future-production obligations and
>    are not satisfied by this act. This acceptance does not advance
>    lifecycle, make D-T0-27 effective, independently open source,
>    authorize another P1 node, release, or professional reliance.

Only item 1 is executed by this Tier-0 application. Items 2 and 3 belong to
the PEC loop and are neither executed nor narrowed here.

## Application result

The exact `.gitattributes` preimage was verified and
`GITATTRIBUTES_PATCH.diff` produced exact postimage SHA-256
`c0d9e5b7e3bbca1f41087959d6095e75d578fef172123050da7145f52fb9d89f`.
Git reports the exact D-T0-28 patch path's `whitespace` attribute as `unset`.
The D-T0-28 patch remains exact SHA-256
`db807bef647db3ef6cd7f4208e5bb5ac5e8ee2775b6a8a19eaeb70434476a499`
and the applied test postimage remains exact SHA-256
`7a4e8aa0fdb28cacdfedb62a307a260bd090136362102b48673ea2a9842d7638`.

The targeted suite passed 18/18, profile-validator tests passed 8/8,
bridge-status completed with no findings, self-check completed at the recorded
baseline, candidate-whitespace passed against `origin/main`, protected PEC
hashes remained exact, and the manifest chain was regenerated. Exact evidence
is in the packet's `APPLICATION_EVIDENCE.md`.

Application is validated and ready for CHANGE publication. It is not
effective before exact merge identity and committed-range `coord-check`.
