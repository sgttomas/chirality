# Bridge Loop Receipts

> **Epistemic status: derivative handoff ledger — not authority.** Append-only.
> Current state is always re-derived from the live tree, the decision registers,
> the ADOPTED profile, git history, and the practitioner-harness commands; on any
> disagreement those sources govern (K-AUTH-1). A receipt records only what tools
> cannot re-derive: owner directions given outside governed artifacts, gate
> outcomes and their rationale, deltas found in dated maps (which are never
> edited), and pointers to the authoritative artifacts created elsewhere.

## Rules (fixed — part of the loop protocol)

1. **Pointer, not narrative.** Prefer paths, PR numbers, commit SHAs, and
   decision IDs. Work history lives in commits, PRs, decision records, and
   deliverable-local files — never here.
2. **Owner directions verbatim.** Any owner direction not otherwise captured in
   a governed artifact is quoted word-for-word with its date. This is the one
   place chat-only directions become durable.
3. **Measurements as check summaries only.** `self-check pass; drift 0/154;
   live pytest pass` is the maximum. Comparison anchors belong in
   harness-recorded form (live pins, adapter baselines) — not in prose here.
4. **Stale-map deltas as one-line pointers.** Dated assessments are never
   edited; a receipt line says what disagreed and where to verify.
5. **Gate outcomes with reason.** stopped / executed / awaiting owner — and
   why, especially no-op outcomes ("all remaining work is owner-shaped"), so
   the next loop neither rediscovers the stop nor invents work around it.
6. **Capped.** Roughly 6–12 lines per receipt. If it wants more, the detail
   belongs in a decision packet, PR description, or deliverable-local record.

## Receipts (append-only)

- **2026-07-02 — Receipt 0** (retroactive; consolidates the pre-receipts era,
  so it exceeds the cap by design — the only receipt permitted to).
  - HEAD at writing: `4dd94adec`; tree clean, synced with origin.
  - Narrative history of Loops 1–2 lives in the sealed Loop Log inside
    `_DomainEngines/bridge/WORKPLAN_2026-07-02_bridge_loop.md` (immutable
    history; superseded by this file for all future loop closes).
  - Owner directions of record (all 2026-07-02, in-session, Ryan Tufts):
    "Consider the dependencies and plan to execute all items, working in
    parallel when write scopes are mutually exclusive." · "Push local main
    first. Then merge, then rule." · the R1–R6 ruling slate (each ruling now
    lives in its governed artifact, below) · "merge the PRs and then give me
    the rulings for the SHAs. We will progress no further than that down any
    development lanes, rather we will reflect on the development loop itself."
    · "I confirm the SHAs." · loop-protocol reform: "Proceed with 1-3 and you
    are delegated the authority to change the text."
  - Authoritative artifacts (pointers only): PRs #12–#20, all owner-merged;
    DEC-055 + DEC-056 in
    `projects/chirality-piping/execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md`
    §12; D-21 packet + §7 ruling at `projects/chirality-piping/execution/_Coordination/_DECISIONS/D-21_prd_scope_change_v0_2_milestone_set.md`;
    D-APP-45/46 ruling records (SHAs bound at `6c975774c`, binding commit
    `940caa108`); tier-0 CHANGE applied via PR #17; class correction
    `projects/chirality-piping/execution/_Reconciliation/LifecycleCorrection/LIFECYCLE_CORRECTION_2026-07-02_2050/Decision_Log.md`
    (drift 92→0); both loop-1 briefs CLOSED (PR #18).
  - Checks at close: self-check pass (exit 0); drift 0/154; live pytest pass.
  - Gate outcome: development lanes **PARKED at owner direction** pending the
    loop reflection — do not resume SCA propagation, package extraction, or
    any new tranche without a fresh owner direction.
  - Remaining owner-shaped items: see the workplan's owner-action pointer
    index (decision IDs only, no status prose).
  - Queued TOOLMAKER work (not executed; lanes parked): migrate loop
    comparison anchors fully into harness-recorded form; a generated
    owner-queue / bridge-status view over decision records.

- **2026-07-03 — Receipt 7**
  - Start: `911f7ce6c`; branch `codex/bridge-ledger-pr-merge` from `origin/main`; tree clean before ledger update.
  - Owner direction of record (2026-07-03, in-session): "Merge the PRs" and "Update the loop ledger".

  - Parked lanes: SCA propagation, package consumption, F3, live binding, and open piping register rows remain owner/environment gated.

- **2026-07-03 — Receipt 8**
  - Start: `2310e30ba`; branch `main` clean/synced; loop entered via `LOOP_INIT.md` on the standing goal-update direction.
  - Owner direction of record (2026-07-03, in-session): "Prepare the next bridge
    package-consumption loop as candidate brief(s), then stop for adoption."
  - Live gates checked: app-dev `D-APP-46` RULED (Option A extraction merged, PR #21
    / content commit `ecc9c5a35`); `D-APP-45` RULED (Flow-A wiring shape only, version
    stays `TBD_BY_TIER_0`); piping `D-21`/`D-22` RULED; tier-0 8/8 RULED; profile
    live-binding line still names x4 gates; DEC-041 automation condition UNMET; DEC-042
    bar on app-dev dependency consumption intact (`SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md:612`).
  - Select: exactly one brief-shaped fence in the consumption lane — DEL-03-01
    (`AgentEnginePort and Engine Conformance Suite`, CHECKING). Code/version/publish/
    piping steps are ruling-shaped, not brief-fenceable (a brief write_scope is the
    DEL governance dir only; `cmd_brief.py:177`).
  - Prepared (NOT committed — gitignored scratch, awaiting owner adoption):
    CANDIDATE `TRB-chirality-app-dev-DEL-03-01-2026-07-03` at
    `_harness_generated/briefs/TRB-chirality-app-dev-DEL-03-01-2026-07-03.md`.
    Objective: doc-only, in-fence — absorb the merged extraction into DEL-03-01
    contract records (close `Datasheet.md:58` source-path TBD; forward-annotate the
    INSP-03 / CODEV-001 rows whose cited paths are now package re-export shims) and
    record the consumption-readiness baseline (`@chirality/harness-contract`
    `0.0.0-private`/`private:true`, exports root+10 subpaths; ruled version wiring
    `FLOW_A_CONTRACT_VERSION=TBD_BY_TIER_0` / `CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK_PACKAGE_VERSION=0.3.150`
    / `HARNESS_TOOL_REGISTRY_VERSION=harness-tools.v6.mutating-mcp`; 64 frontend
    importers on shim paths, 0 direct; dependency lint at `package.json:26`). No
    lifecycle advance (_STATUS stays CHECKING, F4 untouched); no frontend/piping writes.
  - Verification: 3 independent adversarial reviewers (citation integrity, scope
    lawfulness, convention fidelity vs. the closed DEL-10-03 exemplar) — zero findings.
  - Stale-map delta: fresh-derived discovery reproduces this Select; nothing in the
    committed tree pointed a next session at the prepared candidate before this
    receipt (Receipt 7 predates the loop) — hence this pointer.
  - Checks: status x3 no severities; drift 0/154; self-check exit 0 with expected
    INFO=12/NOT_APPLICABLE=1/REVIEW=28/WARN=2 (after deleting rebuildable Loop-1
    scratch under `_harness_generated/`); harness pytest 248 passed.
  - Gate outcome: STOPPED awaiting owner adoption of the candidate brief
    (K-AUTH-1; D-GOV-04). On adoption: owner edits `state:`→HUMAN_ADOPTED, fills
    `adopted_by`/`adopted_on`, moves the file to `docs/governance_harness/briefs/`
    OUTSIDE the gitignored root, commits; then the tranche executes branch-first
    with the deliverable-work check set and a close receipt supersedes this one.
  - Parked lanes: shim-importer migration/wrapper retirement (fence-free app-dev
    refactor, wants owner direction or a D-APP-47 packet), tier-0 Flow-A version
    settlement (D-T0-07), package publishability (F2 or intra-repo mechanism),
    piping-side D-22 consumption (DEC-041 condition + piping vehicle; write-prohibited
    surface), SCA propagation, F3, live binding — all owner/environment gated.

- **2026-07-03 — Receipt 9** (adoption of the Receipt 8 candidate; supersedes its
  "awaiting adoption" gate outcome — the tranche is not yet executed).
  - Owner direction of record (2026-07-03, in-session, Ryan Tufts): "I want it to
    become a governed record. Take care of it."
  - Gate outcome: owner ADOPTED `TRB-chirality-app-dev-DEL-03-01-2026-07-03`
    (K-AUTH-1; D-GOV-04). Metadata recorded by agent at owner direction (D-APP-45
    conformance pattern): `state: HUMAN_ADOPTED`, `adopted_by: Ryan Tufts`,
    `adopted_on: 2026-07-03`, adoption provenance quoting the direction. The brief
    moved out of gitignored scratch to the governed path
    `docs/governance_harness/briefs/TRB-chirality-app-dev-DEL-03-01-2026-07-03.md`;
    it is now the third governed brief alongside the two DEL-10-0x records. Adoption
    binds to this publication commit (K-AUTH-2).
  - Same-commit hygiene: two K-PROV-1 WARNs fixed in the brief (bare `src/...` refs →
    full repo-relative package paths). Conscious live-pin update
    `test_live_baseline.py` severity-totals INFO 12→13 — the new governed brief adds
    one environment-independent generated-root evidence_targets INFO (HB-4 class),
    same shape each DEL-10-0x brief contributes; the pin stays self-consistent with
    the committed tree for CI.
  - Checks: `brief --verify-adoption` = HUMAN_ADOPTED, fence_active True post-commit;
    self-check exit 0 at INFO=13/NOT_APPLICABLE=1/REVIEW=28/WARN=2; drift 0/154;
    harness pytest full (incl. live-baseline) pass.
  - Gate outcome (execution): STOPPED — owner directed adoption only, not tranche
    execution. The fenced deliverable work (absorb the extraction into DEL-03-01's
    Datasheet/Assessment/Evidence records, record the consumption-readiness baseline;
    _STATUS stays CHECKING) is ready to execute branch-first with the deliverable-work
    check set on owner direction; a close receipt supersedes this one at execution.
  - Parked lanes: unchanged from Receipt 8 (shim migration, D-T0-07 version, package
    publishability, D-22 piping consumption, SCA propagation, F3, live binding).

  - Gate outcome: D-APP-47, D-APP-48, D-T0-09, and D-30 are recorded/executed within their authorized control/metadata scope. D-30 consumption is metadata/validator only: no runtime dependency installation, protected-path write, F3/live binding, lifecycle transition, or release/professional claim.

  - Owner direction of record: "Merge PR #34.   I accept the D-29 amendments.  What's expected as you Prepare the piping rows?"
  - Executed pointers: PR #34 merge; accepted SCA-005 snapshot under `projects/chirality-piping/execution/_ScopeChange/SCA-005_2026-07-04_0000/`; `projects/chirality-piping/execution/_ScopeChange/_LATEST.md` now points to SCA-005; D-29 register/ruling/packet updated to accepted and applied; PRD/PLAN/completion-plan/coordination/decomposition forward-authority surfaces updated for the v0.2 PRD propagation.
  - Gate outcome: D-29 is closed as RULED after owner acceptance and SCA-005 Gate 5 propagation. The accepted edits carry forward v0.2 PRD planning authority and the D-21 Annex A FR crosswalk, while preserving the no deliverable/code/schema/lifecycle/release/professional/live-binding/package-consumption boundary.

  - Preparation boundary: those rows remain `NOT_PREPARED`; preparing them means packet drafting and register movement to `AWAITING_RULING`, not execution of release, CI, PDF, protected-content, coverage, issuance, FR-disposition, or contributor-intake work. F3/live binding remains gated by the profile line and DEC-041 automation condition.

- **2026-07-04 — Receipt 18**
  - Start: `6d3a589e2`; branch `claude/piping-decision-packets-8`; PR pending owner merge; pre-existing untracked `projects/9-domains/` left untouched.
  - Owner direction of record: 2026-07-04, in-session, Ryan Tufts — "Prepare the decision packets for the following: For each open row (`D-06`, `D-11`, `D-12`, `D-10b`, `D-04b`, `D-05b`, `D-07b`, `D-20`), that means drafting a packet under `_DECISIONS/`, verifying basis/blockers, presenting options and a non-binding recommendation, adding an explicit human-ruling section, and moving the register state from `NOT_PREPARED` to `AWAITING_RULING`."
  - Executed pointers: eight PROPOSAL packets under `projects/chirality-piping/execution/_Coordination/_DECISIONS/` (`D-06_release_matrix_installers_publication.md`, `D-11_checking_issuance_waves.md`, `D-12_fr024_fr025_disposition.md`, `D-10b_deterministic_pdf_emitter.md`, `D-04b_coverage_tooling_floor_promotion.md`, `D-05b_public_export_ci_activation.md`, `D-07b_contributor_intake_mechanism.md`, `D-20_protected_content_scan.md`); the eight register rows moved `NOT_PREPARED` → `AWAITING_RULING` with packet pointers.
  - Gate outcome: preparation only, per the Receipt 17 preparation boundary — every packet carries the PROPOSAL disclaimer and "**Ruling recorded:** _Awaiting owner ruling._"; no option/value ruling, no execution of release, CI, PDF, coverage, issuance, FR-disposition, or contributor-intake work, no lifecycle/release/professional/live-binding claim. F3/live binding remains gated by the profile line and DEC-041 automation condition.

- **2026-07-04 — Receipt 19** (assessment run)
  - Start: `a7e554d3a`; branch `claude/piping-decision-packets-8` (PR #38 open); main advanced in parallel to `f9cf4a1c9` (PRs #39/#40, pec lane — outside bridge/harness scope by construction).
  - Owner direction of record: 2026-07-04, in-session steer, Ryan Tufts — "evaluate progress made to date and assess if the current planning approach is adequate or what changes you recommend to achieve the inherent goals of this `chirality/` project as it pertains to the harness bridge we are building between `chirality-app-dev` and `chirality-piping`."
  - Delta (live tree vs Receipt 18): at `a7e554d3a` the live-baseline severity pin FAILED (measured REVIEW=30 vs pinned 29; PR #38 `harness` CI red) — `D-05b_public_export_ci_activation.md:54` quoted a machine-absolute path, adding a GEN-8 REVIEW finding after Receipt 18's recorded checks ran; the recorded "pytest 255 passed" did not hold at the branch's final SHA.
  - Executed pointers: fix commit `a605f1b37` (D-05b quote paraphrased repo-safe, citation preserved; pin restored, not weakened); PR #38 `harness` CI green at `a605f1b37`.
  - Assessment delivered in-session (four-lens agent sweep, citations cold-checked): of the profile's x4 live-binding gates two are already cleared (tier-0 adoption; D-21 via DEC-056); the remaining critical path is proven L2 (piping headless-runner CLI entrypoint — lib-only today, `projects/chirality-piping/core/runner/headless/Cargo.toml`), an owner declaration on the DEC-041 automation condition (the D-APP-48 pull mechanism validates green), then the D-T0-08 two-PROPOSAL F3 sequence, then the piping Node sidecar. The eight Receipt-18 packets are piping-internal release-track; recommended ruling order D-06 → D-20 → D-05b, with D-04b/D-10b independent, D-12+D-07b paired at the R5 gate, D-11 anytime.
  - Checks: status x3 no severities; drift 0/154; self-check exit 0 at INFO=14/NOT_APPLICABLE=1/REVIEW=29/WARN=2; full practitioner harness pytest 255 passed; bridge-status pass/no findings.
  - Gate outcome: STOPPED at owner gates — no new tranche selected (assessment steer governed this run); decision slate presented in-session with four owner-shaped items: declaring the DEC-041 automation condition met (or naming its remaining evidence), scoping the proven-L2 headless-entrypoint deliverable in piping's governed lane, whether `projects/pec` enters a governed loop, and an optional tier-0 CHANGE to de-stale the profile's live-binding line. These become lanes only on owner direction.
  - Parked lanes: owner rulings on the eight `AWAITING_RULING` rows (`D-06`, `D-11`, `D-12`, `D-10b`, `D-04b`, `D-05b`, `D-07b`, `D-20`); PR #38 owner merge; F3/live binding remains gated by the profile line and DEC-041 automation condition.

- **2026-07-04 — Receipt 20** (slate execution)
  - Start: `cb1e93ec3` (main, after the owner-directed PR #38 merge); branch `claude/loop-slate-execution`; the owner-directed single PR carries this receipt.
  - Owner direction of record: 2026-07-04, in-session, Ryan Tufts — "First merge PR #38 then complete the recommended changes and then proceed as recommended through the "Decision slate" including #6 for the tier-0 CHANGE to de-stale. All of this should land as just one PR at the end."
  - Slate of record (the six-item decision slate presented in-session at the Receipt 19 assessment close — the direction's "#6" and the artifacts' item numbers resolve against THIS list): (1) merge PR #38 — done, owner-directed, main at `cb1e93ec3`; (2) declare the `DEC-041` automation condition met per the working D-APP-48 mechanism; (3) scope the proven-L2 headless-entrypoint deliverable; (4) rule the eight packets per their recommended dispositions in the order D-06 → D-20 → D-05b with D-04b/D-10b independent, D-12 + D-07b held to the R5 gate, D-11 anytime; (5) `projects/pec` governance entry — recommendation was no bridge-plan change either way; no action taken, owner decision remains open; (6) tier-0 CHANGE de-staling the profile live-binding line.
  - Executed pointers: `DEC-057`–`DEC-062` in `projects/chirality-piping/execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` §12 + six register rows RULED (packet §-ruling fills carry the direction verbatim); `D-06b` minted `NOT_PREPARED`; `D-31` RULED + `D-31_RULING_2026-07-04.md` + `DEC-063` (automation condition declared met; remaining live-binding gate = app-dev F3 alone); `D-32_proven_l2_headless_entrypoint.md` + register row `AWAITING_RULING`; D-APP-44 ruling SHA backfilled `d83e63b95`; tier-0 CHANGE applied per `_DomainEngines/bridge/CHANGE_PREP_2026-07-04_live_binding_gate_destale.md` (profile live-binding line x4→x1, `profile_version` 0.2→0.3, validator VALID); HB-10 `COORD_ABS_PATH_ADDED` added to coord-check; workplan protocol edits (final-SHA closeout rule, no-deep-stacks preference, app-dev own-track pointer); conscious live-pin updates (severity totals REVIEW 29→28; live-binding-gate live pin inverted to zero-findings).
  - Gate outcome: executed under the blanket direction above; three-lens adversarial review run pre-commit — substance clean (all citations/SHAs/§-numbers/scope cold-checked held), its Receipt-20-anchor, slate-numbering, and D-31-quote findings fixed in-tranche; STOPPED awaiting owner merge of this branch's single PR. `D-32` awaits owner ruling; `D-12` + `D-07b` stay held to the R5 gate per slate item 4.
  - Checks: status x3 no severities; drift 0/154; self-check exit 0 at INFO=14/NOT_APPLICABLE=1/REVIEW=28/WARN=2 (conscious pin update — the CHANGE cleared `STALE_LIVE_BINDING_GATE`); profile validator VALID 0/0; bridge-status pass/no findings; coord-check --diff on the committed range exit 0 at INFO=1/REVIEW=15 — zero `COORD_ABS_PATH_ADDED` (HB-10 clean on its own tranche); the REVIEWs are the unresolved-ref class on files never previously in a coord-checked diff (future artifacts lawfully named by PROPOSAL packets, multi-line citation syntax, and untracked-directory mentions in immutable receipt history) — human-review class, no repair lawful; full practitioner harness pytest 260 passed (255 + 5 HB-10).
  - Parked lanes: owner rulings on `D-12` and `D-07b` (held to the R5 gate per slate item 4) and on `D-32`; `D-06b` `NOT_PREPARED` (R5-exit lead-up); rows `D-06`, `D-11`, `D-10b`, `D-04b`, `D-05b`, `D-20` retired from the parked set — ruled as `DEC-057`–`DEC-062` this receipt; the Receipt 19 token "F3/live binding remains gated by the profile line and DEC-041 automation condition" is retired — the DEC-041 automation condition is declared met (`DEC-063`) and the de-staled profile line now names app-dev F3 alone; live binding remains gated by app-dev F3 (D-T0-08 sequence; proven-L2 scoping at `D-32`).

- **2026-07-04 — Receipt 21** (D-32 ruling)
  - Start: `92b5940f6` (main, after the owner-directed PR #42 merge); branch `claude/d32-ruling`.
  - Owner direction of record: 2026-07-04, in-session, Ryan Tufts — "Merge PR #42 and rule D-32 O-A as recommended."
  - Executed pointers: PR #42 merged (owner-directed; the merge was already complete at execution time); D-32 packet §6 ruling fill; `DEC-064` appended to `projects/chirality-piping/execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` §12; register row `D-32` → RULED with the packet and `DEC-064` pointers.
  - Gate outcome: ruling recorded per the packet §7 mechanism, with all four §5 riders adopted; the in-DEL-10-05 implementation tranche (thin `[[bin]]` entrypoint + validated-kernel-run evidence) is now lawful under those riders, and the rider-3 execution act — naming the vehicle or granting the `core/**` write scope — is the remaining owner direction before any code lands; STOPPED awaiting owner merge of this branch's PR (#43) and that direction. `D-12` + `D-07b` unchanged (R5 gate).
  - Checks: status x3 no severities; drift 0/154; self-check exit 0 at INFO=14/NOT_APPLICABLE=1/REVIEW=28/WARN=2 (unchanged); bridge-status pass/no findings; coord-check --diff on the committed range pass; `git diff --check` pass; full practitioner harness pytest 260 passed.
  - Parked lanes: owner rulings on `D-12` and `D-07b` (held to the R5 gate per slate item 4); `D-06b` `NOT_PREPARED` (R5-exit lead-up); the Receipt 20 token "owner rulings on ... `D-32`" is retired — ruled as `DEC-064` this receipt; the D-32 rider-3 vehicle/write-scope direction awaits the owner; live binding remains gated by app-dev F3 (D-T0-08 sequence; the proven-L2 tranche is `DEC-064`-scoped and unexecuted).

- **2026-07-04 — Receipt 22** (PR #43 merge; rider-3 grant made durable)
  - Start: `bedc277bb` (main, PR #43 merged fast-forward); branch `claude/receipt22-steer`.
  - Owner direction of record: 2026-07-04, in-session, Ryan Tufts — "then merge PR #43 right now and update what's appropriate in regards to that. And let's make the necessary decisions right now and pass that steering on." The owner thereby adopted the proposed execution steer as the direction of record for the next loop iteration (the rider-3 act DEC-064 reserved to the owner), verbatim: "merge the open bridge-ledger PR if one is open, then execute the DEC-064 proven-L2 tranche in this loop: write scope granted for `projects/chirality-piping/core/runner/headless/**` and the DEL-10-05 deliverable directory (rider 3). Build the thin provisional `[[bin]]` entrypoint and the commit-bound validated-kernel-run evidence record, branch-first, closing with the DEC-025 sweep and an adversarial review. Stop before any tier-0 profile edit or L2 claim — the tier-0 acknowledgment is a separate owner act."
  - Executed pointers: PR #43 merged at `bedc277bb` (owner-directed); `D-31_RULING_2026-07-04.md` Ruling SHA bound to its publication commit `e19c18ab4` (backfill per the D-APP-44/tier-0 precedent).
  - Gate outcome: the DEC-064 tranche is now fully authorized — ruling (Receipt 21) plus this rider-3 vehicle/write-scope grant; execution belongs to the next iteration per the steer above. STOPPED awaiting owner merge of this branch's PR. `D-12` + `D-07b` unchanged (R5 gate).
  - Checks: status x3 no severities; drift 0/154; self-check exit 0 at INFO=14/NOT_APPLICABLE=1/REVIEW=28/WARN=2 (unchanged); bridge-status pass/no findings; `git diff --check` pass; full practitioner harness pytest 260 passed.
  - Parked lanes: owner rulings on `D-12` and `D-07b` (held to the R5 gate per slate item 4); `D-06b` `NOT_PREPARED` (R5-exit lead-up); the Receipt 21 token "the D-32 rider-3 vehicle/write-scope direction awaits the owner" is retired — granted this receipt (execution steer of record above); live binding remains gated by app-dev F3 (D-T0-08 sequence; the `DEC-064` proven-L2 tranche executes next iteration per the steer of record; the tier-0 acknowledgment and the D-T0-08 F3 PROPOSALs follow as owner acts).

- **2026-07-04 — Receipt 23** (DEC-064 tranche executed; acknowledgment + F3 packets staged)
  - Start: `831b24c11` (main, after the parallel pec lane's PR #45); branch `claude/dec064-proven-l2`.
  - Owner direction of record: 2026-07-04, in-session, Ryan Tufts — "THen execute the DEC-064 tranche now, in this session, then stage the L2-acknowledgment CHANGE and both F3 PROPOSAL packets while the evidence is fresh."
  - Executed pointers: PROVISIONAL entrypoint `projects/chirality-piping/core/runner/headless/src/bin/headless_preview_runner.rs` (TP-RUNNER-014; zero new dependencies, `Cargo.toml` byte-untouched); witness `projects/chirality-piping/validation/witness/generated/tp_runner_014_headless_entrypoint_preview_run.json`; run record `WORKING_ITEMS_RUN_2026-07-04_TP-RUNNER-014.md` + DEL-10-05 `MEMORY.md` entry; DEC-025 sweep artifact `SWEEP_20260704T193342Z_98dfde1d18ac-dirty.json` (5/5 pass; sole dirty path = a parallel lane's untracked monorepo-root `plans/` note, documented in the run record); staged-not-applied `_DomainEngines/bridge/CHANGE_PREP_2026-07-04_proven_l2_acknowledgment.md` + tier-0 register row `D-T0-10` (HumanRuling OPEN; isolated control-root commit); F3 PROPOSAL packets `D-APP-49_PACKET_F3_SOURCE_TYPES_2026-07-04.md` and `D-APP-50_PACKET_F3_DOMAIN_MCP_TOOLS_2026-07-04.md` + app-dev register rows `AWAITING_RULING`.
  - Deltas (live tree wins): (1) the tranche commits initially landed on local `main` — a concurrent session sharing this checkout moved HEAD; repaired by repointing `claude/dec064-proven-l2` to the tip and resetting local `main` to `origin/main`, recorded here rather than rewritten. (2) The sweep's `-dirty` marker is environment-caused by the parallel lane's untracked file; all five surfaces pass bound to the fully committed tranche tree.
  - Gate outcome: DEC-064 tranche executed under the Receipt 22 grant, within scope (only `core/**` write is the granted bin; `_STATUS.md`/Datasheet/profile byte-untouched; no L2 claim made). Three-lens adversarial review: evidence reproduced byte-identical (independent re-run SHA-matched the witness), scope and ruled boundaries clean; its MAJOR (D-APP-49 path-base convention) and MINOR/NIT findings fixed in-tranche; one accepted-known NIT — the bin doc's exit-0 wording is looser than the stricter implemented guard (behaviorally identical today; code untouched to preserve the sweep binding). STOPPED at owner gates: merge of this branch's PR; the `D-T0-10` acknowledgment; rulings on `D-APP-49` then `D-APP-50`.
  - Checks: headless crate tests 17/17, `cargo fmt --check` clean; entrypoint run exit 0; DEC-025 sweep 5/5; status x3 no severities; drift 0/154; self-check exit 0 at INFO=14/NOT_APPLICABLE=1/REVIEW=28/WARN=2 (unchanged); bridge-status pass/no findings; coord-check --diff on the committed range exit 0 at INFO=1/REVIEW=26 — zero `COORD_ABS_PATH_ADDED`; the REVIEWs are the unresolved-ref class on the two new app-dev packets, whose citations follow the established app-dev-relative convention (declared in each packet's Paths note) that the checker resolves neither repo-root- nor file-relative — human-review class, convention kept for sibling-packet consistency; `git diff --check` pass; full practitioner harness pytest 260 passed.
  - Parked lanes: owner rulings on `D-12` and `D-07b` (held to the R5 gate per slate item 4); `D-06b` `NOT_PREPARED` (R5-exit lead-up); `D-T0-10` OPEN — awaiting owner acknowledgment; `D-APP-49` and `D-APP-50` `AWAITING_RULING` (sequential per D-T0-08); live binding remains gated by app-dev F3 (D-T0-08 sequence; the `DEC-064` proven-L2 tranche is executed this receipt with evidence committed; the tier-0 acknowledgment is `D-T0-10`; the F3 PROPOSALs are `D-APP-49`/`D-APP-50`).

- **2026-07-04 — Receipt 24** (F3 opened: D-T0-10 acknowledged; D-APP-49 ruled + tranche landed; D-APP-50 ruled)
  - Start: `f4169a282` (main, after the owner-directed PR #46 merge); branches `claude/f3-source-types` (PR #47, merged `fe15cfe68`) and `claude/dapp50-ruling-receipt24` (this PR).
  - Owner direction of record: 2026-07-04, in-session steer, Ryan Tufts — "Proceed accordingly: merge PR #46 → acknowledge D-T0-10 → rule D-APP-49 → rule D-APP-50 once the source-types tranche lands."
  - Executed pointers: `D-T0-10` ACKNOWLEDGED — record `_DomainEngines/_DECISIONS/D-T0-10_proven_l2_acknowledgment.md`, staged CHANGE applied (profile `profile_version` 0.3→0.4; validator VALID), ruling SHA `2081d6daa`; `D-APP-49` RULED O-A riders 1-5 — `projects/chirality-app-dev/execution/_Coordination/_DECISIONS/D-APP-49_RULING_2026-07-04.md`, ruling SHA `456b316b1`, tranche landed at the PR #47 merge `fe15cfe68` (`domain-profile.ts` + `operation-proposal.ts` in `@chirality/harness-contract`, barrel re-exports, 34 guard tests, TYPES.md §11 forward-note, D-APP-38 corpus v5); `D-APP-50` RULED O-A riders 1-6 — `projects/chirality-app-dev/execution/_Coordination/_DECISIONS/D-APP-50_RULING_2026-07-04.md`, ruling SHA `cfa497b8d` (this PR).
  - Deltas (live tree wins): (1) the D-APP-50 ruling commit initially landed on the parallel pec lane's branch — the concurrent session sharing this checkout moved HEAD again (Receipt 23 delta class); repaired by cherry-pick onto `claude/dapp50-ruling-receipt24` and restoring `claude/pec-bridge-loop` to its own tip `19f1343cb`, recorded here rather than rewritten. (2) The `harness-premerge` CI workflow fails on every PR in its run history — the repo secret `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is absent; its substance passed locally at the PR #47 final SHA (premerge pass, 8 + section-9 14 report-only) — owner-side environment item, not a code defect.
  - Gate outcome: the directed queue executed in full; five-lens adversarial review of the tranche + governance records returned zero must-fix findings (two NITs fixed in-tranche). STOPPED at the queue's end. The D-T0-08 decision sequence is complete — proven L2 acknowledged, source types landed, MCP tools ruled — so the `D-APP-50` implementing tranche (domain MCP tools: read-first order, `operation_applier.apply` excluded, transport settled in-tranche within DEC-041's posture) is lawful agent-side work for the next iteration under its riders; no further owner act gates it.
  - Checks: app-dev typecheck / vitest 585 passed / contract-deps / premerge pass at the PR #47 final SHA `0ea2e573a`; status x3 no severities; drift 0/154; self-check exit 0 at INFO=14/NOT_APPLICABLE=1/REVIEW=28/WARN=2 (unchanged — the CHANGE prep's no-pin-movement prediction held); profile validator VALID 0/0; bridge-status pass/no findings; coord-check --diff on the committed ranges exit 0 with REVIEW findings all of the unresolved-ref human-review class, zero `COORD_ABS_PATH_ADDED`; `git diff --check` pass; full practitioner harness pytest 260 passed (closeout set re-run at this branch's final SHA before merge).
  - Parked lanes: owner rulings on `D-12` and `D-07b` (held to the R5 gate per slate item 4); `D-06b` `NOT_PREPARED` (R5-exit lead-up); the Receipt 23 tokens "`D-T0-10` OPEN — awaiting owner acknowledgment" and "`D-APP-49` and `D-APP-50` `AWAITING_RULING` (sequential per D-T0-08)" are retired — acknowledged and ruled this receipt (register rows RULED with ruling records); live binding remains gated by app-dev F3 execution — the remaining gate substance is the unexecuted `D-APP-50` tranche plus tier-0 L2→L3 movement (per-operation risk-graded, D-T0-03).
