# Source inventory

Standing: **source identification (agent).** What the v4 conceptual
undertaking examined, where it is, and what each source can and cannot
support. Paths are at the investigation revision `2b0572fe0` unless marked
`ORIG/` (Git-ignored archives, see [`archives/ARCHIVES.md`](archives/ARCHIVES.md))
or given as a GitHub reference. "Examined by" names the preserved TASK return
([`tasks/`](../execution/_Coordination/AgentRuns/V4-CONCEPT-20260925/tasks/))
or HELPS_HUMANS directly (HH). Pinned revisions are in
[`REFERENCES.md`](REFERENCES.md).

## How to weigh a source

| Kind | Can support | Cannot support |
|---|---|---|
| The owner's recorded words (verbatim or hash-bound transcription) | What the owner intended, preferred or decided at that time and in that scope | That the intention worked; a scope wider than the words |
| Accepted requirement or ruling in a project | What that project committed to, on its revision | A v4 requirement (OD-10), or that it was built |
| Described design, plan, review or survey | The reasoning and the options considered | That the design exists or works |
| Code | That a mechanism exists on that revision | That it runs, is reachable, or is used |
| Test definition | What someone intended to check | That the check passed on a given revision |
| Executed check with a record | That the check passed or failed on the recorded candidate and conditions | Behaviour on other revisions, hosts, or with real users |
| Agent-drafted conceptual text (thesis, manuals) | The argument and its sources; practices worth trying | That a practice is effective (no empirical study exists) |
| Agent returns in this run | Where to look; a reading of the sources | Anything on their own: rely on the cited source |

| `docs/alignment-manual/Project_Management_for_Human_Agent_Teams_Consolidated_v7.md` | Owner-directed, largely externally drafted; owner-signed authorship section; "does not establish that every practice … has been proved effective" | T2 |
| `docs/alignment-manual/Project_Management_for_Human_Agent_Teams_Field_Book_v1.md` | Agent abridgement for a human reader | HH, T2 |

## 3. Root governance (applies to v4 — OD-10)

| Source | Relevance | Examined by |

## 10. Not examined in this pass

Held for Stage E if a question needs them: the full App PRD body and ruling
records A1–A15 / R1–R18; individual control-loop pass files; the contents of
the two archived zip files; the SWBPIPE UX specification and external-prover
format research; PEC's feed-model design note; `ORIG/.archive/domains/` and
`ORIG/domains/` corpora; the app's local session records
(`ORIG/projects/chirality-app-dev/frontend/.chirality/sessions`), which may
contain private content and would be read only for a specific question.
