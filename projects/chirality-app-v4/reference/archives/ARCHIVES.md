# Git-ignored archives — inventory and read access

Standing: **source identification and access rule.** This file lists the
Git-ignored material in the original checkout that the v4 undertaking may
examine, how to read it from any worktree, and how to confirm it has not
changed. It makes no product claim.

## Access

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Archive root | `/Users/ryan/ai-env/projects/chirality` (the original checkout; override with `CHIRALITY_ARCHIVE_ROOT`) |
| How to read | Absolute paths below the archive root, from any worktree or session. Worktrees do not carry these files. |
| Rule | **Read only.** Do not modify, move, rename, extract into, or delete anything below these paths. Keep them until the owner decides v4 has replaced the v3.0.1 fallback (OD-09). |
| Hazard | These paths are Git-ignored. `git clean -X` or `git clean -x` run in the original checkout would delete them, and Git could not restore them. Do not run either there. |
| Check | `python3 projects/chirality-app-v4/reference/archives/archive_digests.py verify` recomputes the content digests and names any archive, subtree, or listed file that changed. |
| Recorded | 2026-09-25 (UTC time in [`archive_digests.json`](archive_digests.json)); 19 locations, 57,073 files; recording takes about 20 s |

The digest file holds, for every location, a whole-location digest with its
file count and size, and digests of the subtrees below it to the depth shown
in the inventory. **Because this repository is public and these archives are
deliberately Git-ignored, the committed file names nothing below the 19
locations:** subtree digests are keyed by the SHA-256 of the subtree's path.
`verify` recomputes locally and prints the real name of any changed subtree.
A per-file list can be written to a local, uncommitted path with
`archive_digests.py record --file-list <path>`.

## Inventory

Relevance is to the v4 conceptual investigation: **high** = primary evidence
about App generations or intended hosts; **medium** = useful context or
occasional reference; **low** = kept for preservation, unlikely to inform the
PRD. The history investigation refines these ratings (see the
[source inventory](../SOURCE_INVENTORY.md)).

## Not inventoried

| Location | Reason |
|---|---|
| `.claude/` (28 GB) | Claude Code session data and worktrees, including this undertaking's own worktree. Not an archive. |
| `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.next/`, `target/` (including `projects/chirality-piping/apps/desktop/src-tauri/target`, 9.7 GB) | Dependency and build outputs, reproducible from tracked sources. |
| `projects/pec/*.db*` | Live PEC database files; they change during use. |
| `projects/chirality-piping/apps/desktop/{dist,public,src-tauri/gen}` and `*.tsbuildinfo`, `Cargo.lock` files under `core/` | Build outputs and lock files generated locally. |
| `.DS_Store` files | Finder metadata. |

## Optional hardening (not performed)

The archives exist in one place. On this APFS volume a copy-on-write clone
(`cp -cR`) would protect them against accidental deletion in the original
checkout at almost no additional disk space. Making one creates a new
directory outside the repository, so it waits for the owner's choice (see
the conceptual questions).
