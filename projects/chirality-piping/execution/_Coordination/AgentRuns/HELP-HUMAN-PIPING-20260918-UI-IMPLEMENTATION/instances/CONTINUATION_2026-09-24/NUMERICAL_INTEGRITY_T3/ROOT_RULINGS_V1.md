# ROOT's early rulings on the V1 review

HELP_HUMAN (ROOT), 2026-09-26, relayed to the T3 manager by SendMessage and recorded here by the manager. Inputs: [REVIEW/RETURN.md](REVIEW/RETURN.md) (verdict BLOCKING) and the manager's [proposed dispositions](MANAGER_NOTES/V1_DISPOSITIONS.md). These rulings let the revisions start; ROOT rules the rest in the full disposition package.

1. **V1-B1 is fixed in D1 revision 2, and stays BLOCKING until V1 backchecks it.**
   - Sum every source-level contribution exactly and round once: loads, and combinations over retained states.
   - Put combination outputs under the stop rule.
   - Add V1's cancellation case and a combination case as negative controls.
   - Withdraw the §3.1 claim.
   - V1-S8: either prove that 1e-9 holds for every published quantity, or state and enforce the floor, for example by withholding quantities below it.
2. **V1-S11 is a silent-wrong path live on main.** T3 owns it at top priority.
   - Map it now: its exact reach, the routes, and a realistic-magnitude example as well as the extreme one.
   - Propose containment that can land early as its own small slice, before any general-method work. For example, detect input cancellation beyond binary64 and mark the result Sensitive, or refuse it.
   - If the containment touches only files T1 does not change, it may land before T1 merges.
   - R1, or an addendum to it, needs a reference case.
3. **Interface.**
   - The package must carry a concrete recommendation for when `load-reference-source-1` stops being fresh; ROOT rules on it there.
   - Adopted now: V1's split of S-E into S-E1 (the re-derivation core, kept) and S-E2 (the joined standing wiring, conditional).
   - Adopted now: one shared retirement gate for D1's I-3 and D2's R-B, covering coverage, budgets, standing in all three languages, and value agreement (V1-S2).
   - Name an owner for the successor-identity readers (V1-S3).
4. **V1-S5, capture refusal of |x| ≥ 2^53.** It makes a 1e16 N/m spring unsolvable on every route. It is a refusal, not a silent wrong, but it is a real capability hole. T3 owns the capture step; T6 owns the export carriers. D2 corrects its PR-5 predictions.
5. **The remaining SHOULD-FIXes (S4, S6, S7, S9, S10) go into the revisions.** For S6, prefer a reader rule that cannot diverge across languages, such as refusing when a host-exp field is used, over a one-ulp tolerance that depends on the host.

## Manager's application

- **Successor-identity readers (V1-S3):** D2 owns them, as the manager proposed (dispositions R-5).
- **The shared retirement gate:** D1 defines it, and D2 cites it (dispositions R-4).
- **S11:** mapped in [MANAGER_NOTES/S11_MAP.md](MANAGER_NOTES/S11_MAP.md). D1 designs the containment slice as the first deliverable of revision 2. R1 gets the RF-CANCEL addendum ([TASK_BRIEFS/R1_ADDENDUM_CANCEL.md](TASK_BRIEFS/R1_ADDENDUM_CANCEL.md)).
- **Still open for ROOT in the package:** the fate of the joined identity (dispositions R-3 (a)); the eligibility of historical physics-source-1 (R-3 (b)); historical all-selected source-blocks-1 (R-7).

## Further rulings (ROOT, 2026-09-26, after `065c9ff60`)

ROOT gave these rulings so the revisions do not wait for the package.

- **R-3(a): accepted.** `load-reference-source-1` stays fresh until D1's F3 (W1b) lands, and stops being fresh when F3 lands. S-E1 is built alongside F3. S-E2 is built only if F3 will not land within T3. D2's revision schedules S-E2 as conditional on that, and records the condition.
- **R-3(b): yes.** Historical physics-source-1 stays eligible. It has no known defect, and retiring it for fresh solves does not change the standing of results that were solved correctly. A defect found later by V1, P1 or the references reopens this ruling.
- **R-7: option (i).** Historical all-selected source-blocks-1 stays Current, with the notice and the summary rule-binding refusal, exactly as T0R ruled in R-2. The abs-sum summary is the only known-defective quantity, and it is already blocked from reliance. The other quantities are correct, so demoting them would withhold correct results with no correctness gain. D2's revision adopts (i) and records why (ii) is not taken.
- **S11 containment.** Whichever option is chosen must fail closed, per case, wherever it interacts with `source_recovery`'s bit-equality check. Knocking out correct retained-source recovery is acceptable only as a declared, temporary refusal, never as a silent loss of a result. The manager brings D1's `S11_CONTAINMENT.md` to ROOT as soon as it lands.
- R1's agent name is `a61ebde0db2f338eb`. ROOT has forwarded the RF-CANCEL addendum to it.

## S11 containment (ROOT, 2026-09-26, after `70f56b83e`)

- **The V1 check is authorized.** The manager sends `S11_CONTAINMENT.md` to V1 directly, read-only and with standard-library probes only. The questions: whether any value can be silently wrong, including through a producer that bypasses the ledger; whether the screen catches every absorption that breaches 1e-9 on published quantities; whether the source-recovery and receipt comparisons stay bit-consistent; whether restrained-DOF reactions and the nonlinear loop are covered; and whether the "three or more contributions" narrowing holds for realistic models (two adjacent element-load equivalents plus a nodal load on a shared node).
- **Pre-accepted, subject to V1 returning CLEAR on S11, or with its findings fixed and backchecked:**
  - C3-full, split into S11-K and S11-F. S11-K lands dormant as soon as the host is released, serialized with D1's K2 and K5 on `SA`. S11-F is the first facade slice after T1 merges.
  - No interim measure before T1 merges. Exposure needs three or more contributions and a gross-to-net ratio of about 1e7 or more; nothing committed has that, and T1 is in final qualification. **This ruling reopens if T1's merge slips materially.**
  - The envelope-level Sensitive side effect on the guard path is accepted. It is recorded as open work for T6, since case-scoped standing belongs to T6's result semantics.
  - The conservative flag (for example the 1e5-to-0.3 row) is accepted: flagging Sensitive when a result might be accurate is the correct direction.
- ROOT records the selection once V1 returns.

## Rulings on V1's S11 check (ROOT, 2026-09-26, after `56b651282`)

V1's check of `S11_CONTAINMENT.md` ([REVIEW/S11_CHECK.md](REVIEW/S11_CHECK.md)) is BLOCKING. **The pre-acceptance of C3-full above is suspended** until D1 revises S11 and V1 backchecks it CLEAR.

1. **S11-V1 (BLOCKING).** Exact summation extends to every post-solve recovery sum that folds element loads: element end forces (K_e·u − equivalent), station resultants, the stress-maximum sums and curved-bend intensities. All of them use the same exact accumulation and rounding function. The `straight_pipe` part is T1-disjoint and joins S11-K. Probe A becomes a test, alongside a mutation that restores the binary64 fold and must fail. **Invariant:** the containment never makes a quantity newly silent that C3-detect would have flagged; this is stated and tested on probe A.
2. **S11-V2 and S11-V3.** Ledger bypass is impossible by construction. The force vector can only be built from the ledger, and a test enumerates every force-accumulation site, so a new producer that skips the ledger fails. The ledger's contribution granularity is defined so that no producer pre-sums before pushing. The screen's floor is stated and recorded (as for V1-S8). The guard path is defence in depth, not the primary correctness mechanism.
3. **S11-V4.**
   - All T1 sites are named: `source_recovery.rs:609-667` including the eigen fold, `source_receipt.rs:218-219`, and `source_receipt.rs:320`. Missing `:320` would reintroduce the forbidden finalization Err.
   - The rounding is correctly rounded. `Expansion::rounded()` is not (V1 probe D), so a correctly rounded function is implemented, and an exact zero gives +0.0 everywhere.
   - D1 states where `Expansion::rounded()` is used on main today and whether any published or bit-compared value depends on it. If one does, that is a new finding for the map.
   - V1's 0.4.0 test is added: an eigen pair plus a nodal load at a shared node, a selected join, and successful finalization.
4. **S11-V5 (NOTE).** Friction terms in the nonlinear loop, and the absence of an in-loop load guard, are recorded as open with T5.
5. **S11-V6. The no-interim ruling stands, restated.** Exposure is governed by the gross-to-net ratio and the order of addition, not by the contribution count. Errors stay at about one rounding step of the gross load; V1's realistic case is about 3e-9 N absolute on a 1.3 N net load. Losing the whole response needs a ratio of 2^53 or more. It still reopens if T1's merge slips materially. **Correction to the S11 pre-acceptance above:** its rationale "exposure needs three or more contributions … nothing committed has that" is superseded by this restatement. Three or more contributions per DOF are normal in real models (V1 S11-V6). The earlier text is kept as history.
6. **S11-V7.** The S11-F record discloses that it changes result bits in real user models. It carries a fixture diff showing that committed fixtures are unchanged.

V1 backchecks S11 together with D1's revision-2 backcheck.

### Adopted text of the no-interim ruling (ROOT, verbatim; replaces both earlier rationales)

ROOT adopted the manager's restatement verbatim. It is the governing text of the S11 no-interim ruling. It replaces the rationale in the S11 pre-acceptance ("exposure needs three or more contributions …") and the wording of item 5 immediately above. Both earlier texts remain as history only.

> No interim measure before T1 merges. The error is at most about half a unit in the last place of the gross load on the DOF, so it reaches 1e-9 of the net only when gross exceeds net by about 1e7 in an unfavourable order. The fix repairs rather than contains. Reopens if T1's merge slips materially or P1 finds a Passed breach in a realistic model.

ROOT's crossing message confirms the manager's proposed dispositions for S11-V1 to V5 and V7, plus ROOT's two additions: the no-new-silence invariant tested on probe A, and D1 reporting where `Expansion::rounded()` is used on main today. All of these have been sent to D1.

## Decisions on S11 revision 2 (ROOT, 2026-09-26, after `4663cdbb6`)

- **D-S11-1: the zero witness, as D1 proposes.**
  - The ledger, the force vector and every bit-compared path use +0.
  - A replaced published expression keeps -0.0 only where the old expression is also an exact zero. This preserves committed evidence bytes, and -0.0 on an exact-zero diagnostic carries no wrong meaning.
  - **Condition:** the witness rule applies only to published diagnostic renderings, never to a value that feeds a bit-equality check or a receipt. V1 checks that boundary.
- **D-S11-2: yes.** `Expansion::rounded()` is replaced at all three FK sites, under the fixture stop rule.
- **D-S11-3: accepted.** S11-K carries live repairs in T1-disjoint files (`straight_pipe`, `load_case_algebra`, the FK rounding sites). It is therefore a full product slice with full gates: independent review, hosted CI including the surface-4 dual-viewport dispatch, a clean DEC-025 sweep, and the fixture stop rule. It lands as its own PR to main.
- **D-S11-4: yes.** No in-band marker; disclosure goes in the change records.
- **Backcheck.** S11 revision 2 goes to V1 now. DESIGN revision 2 gets a second, narrow backcheck when it lands.
- **New findings, added to the map:**
  - **N-S11-R** (low severity): the M03 intended-action residual (`FK/structural.rs:554`) is published in diagnostics using a naive, not correctly rounded, sum. It is an imprecise diagnostic value, not a wrong mechanics result, and D-S11-2 fixes it.
  - **Formation silent zero** (`FK/lib.rs:717-726`): an underflowed stiffness-coefficient product becomes 0 with no error. This is a silent input change on main. D1 states whether it can change a published result beyond 1e-9 in any realistic or RF-RANGE case. K2 (checked formation) is scheduled as an early T1-disjoint slice, next after S11-K, or bundled with S11-K if it shares files and review.

## Rulings on V1's backcheck of S11 revision 2 (ROOT, 2026-09-26, after `61b228543`)

Input: [REVIEW/S11_BACKCHECK.md](REVIEW/S11_BACKCHECK.md), BLOCKING on S11B-1 and S11B-2.

- **The manager's dispositions of S11B-2 to S11B-7 and the formation item are confirmed**, as sent to D1 for S11 revision 3.
- **S11B-1 does not block T1's merge.** S11B-1 is the prescribed-motion RHS `f − Σ K_fc·g`, folded in binary64 in FK (`FK/structural.rs:603-606`, `FK/lib.rs:870-877`). It is live on T1's 0.4.0 support-motion route. It is the same class and bound as S11: about one rounding step of the gross `K_fc·g` term.
  - The no-interim ruling is extended explicitly to T1's 0.4.0 support-motion route.
  - It keeps the same reopen triggers, plus one more: P1, or T1's final review, finds a Passed breach on a realistic settlement case.
- **Its priority rises.** The exact reduced RHS at both FK sites joins S11-K, and S11-K should land soon after T1 merges.
- ROOT tells T1's manager directly. T1 records S11B-1 in its checkpoint 7 as a known, routed open item (T3, S11-K), citing `61b228543`. The T3 manager does not contact T1.

## Rulings on V1's BACKCHECK_R2 (ROOT, 2026-09-26, after `3ea78add8`)

Input: [REVIEW/BACKCHECK_R2.md](REVIEW/BACKCHECK_R2.md). Verdict FINDINGS, nothing blocking; V1-B1 fully resolved.

- **S2-R.** Condition 3 of the retirement gate (standing in all three languages) is satisfied when every language implements identical, fail-closed standing for the whole family. It does not require every case to become eligible. For the joined family under H-a, a case using a host-exp (logarithmic) law reads `needs_recompute` in all three languages; that is correct standing, and it passes the condition. Those cases are simply not eligible. The same rule applies to any family with a declared out-of-scope subset. D1 records this in the gate definition, and D2 cites it.
- **S8-R: the floor is enforced, not just stated.**
  - Classify on the published binary64 value, never on the unpublished precision-p value.
  - R is an exact binary64 constant.
  - D2's G5 gains the S\* and classification check, and a rule for `absolute_verified` quantities: they are withheld from Current, or explicitly exempt with a stated reason.
  - A quantity below the floor is withheld or marked uncovered, and never counted as Passed.
- **SCALE-W.** The kernel half of formation-time scaling (`FK/lib.rs`) is assigned to K2b's write set.
- **F2-P.** The F2 erratum lands with the twist and extension kinds, their derivation and the no-pass rule. V1 backchecks it against V2's corrected counts (43 to 53 RF-WEAK and 3 RF-CANCEL).
- **Notes.**
  - S11B-1's FK sites are added to S11-K's write set.
  - D1 states the `digest_ok()` dependency.
  - The LEF-small correction is recorded.
  - The `retained/` mod declaration gets one owning slice.
- **Next.** S11 revision 3 is still required, for S11B-2 to S11B-7, and V1 backchecks it narrowly. After that, and after R1's narrow revision and V2's recheck, the manager brings ROOT the selection package.

### S2-R, final wording (ROOT, crossing message; supersedes the S2-R bullet above)

Gate condition 3 reads: **"the successor identity's standing is no worse than the retiring identity's, case by case, in all three languages."** Each language's standing must also be identical and fail-closed. The H-a log-law cases are listed as `needs_recompute` under both identities. The switch happens at F3, as R-3(a) ruled.

ROOT confirms the manager's other dispositions (S8-R, F2-P, the notes) and the consolidation into D1 revision 3, S11 revision 3 and a narrow D2 revision 3.

On SCALE-W, the two ROOT messages differ. The explicit ruling assigns the kernel half of formation-time scaling to K2b's write set, while the manager had proposed a new slice after K2a. The manager applies the explicit ruling (K2b) and has told ROOT.

ROOT confirms SCALE-W stays in **K2b**. The kernel half of formation-time scaling belongs with the W2 scaling work, and a separate slice would add a PR with no review benefit. The discrepancy noted above is resolved.

## D2 probe findings (ROOT, 2026-09-26, after `7a6e6f00b`)

- **F-P2 is confirmed.** A rejected, unrecoverable case blocks the whole invocation on every route, under the existing M03 rule. It is recorded as open with D1's F2 (the general method, which recovers such cases), and the corrected probe PR-2b goes into the implementation slice. The whole-invocation-blocking half stays with T6, as the case-scoped standing question already routed there. It fails closed, so no containment is needed.
- **F-P7** goes to T6's carrier-migration notes. binary64 renders 1e16 and 1e20 as integral literals that checked-profile consumers cannot read back, so every consumer of a carrier switches profile together.
- No other rulings are needed on these returns.

## P1's skew Passed breach (ROOT, 2026-09-26)

The finding: `RF-SKEW-T-CANT-OFF-122-r1e-04` is published Passed and Current-eligible on main (preview-physics-1, checks_passed, numerically_eligible). Its RX rotations are about 2.4e-9 relative off (8e-14 rad absolute), at 2.43 times the criterion in dense mode and 1.21 times in sparse mode. There is no cancellation, and the magnitudes are ordinary: a 144 N·m/rad rotational spring (k/a ≈ 1e-4), a 3 m member along (1,2,2), and mN·m tip moments. The 345 sibling passes.

1. **Classification.** This is a genuine silent-wrong finding against the protected criterion, and the most important T3 finding so far. It is a confirmed M03 finding. The "provisional" label is removed once P1 re-evaluates it against the frozen references (`ROOT_SELECTION_REFERENCES.md`).
2. **Containment: no interim measure now.** The error is about 2.4e-9 relative (8e-14 rad absolute) and bounded by ordinary conditioning, and an interim detector would be the same trigger design W1 needs. **It reopens** if P1 finds a Passed breach at 1e-7 relative or worse, or on a realistic multi-member model.
3. **D-5 is now a required decision in the package, not optional.** D1:
   - shows why 122 fails and 345 passes;
   - costs the three options: (a) a forward-error trigger at the Passed boundary, (b) always running W1 for skew models, (c) always running W1 wherever it applies;
   - gives the fraction of R1 cases each option would reroute, and the runtime cost;
   - says whether the trigger can land early as a kernel-local Passed→Sensitive demotion, T1-disjoint, ahead of W1.

   **ROOT's direction:** whatever is chosen, "Passed" must not be publishable for a case the reference suite shows breaching 1e-9. ROOT rules on the options in the package.
4. **P1 search.** P1 looks for more cases in this class across all of R1's families (Passed plus a breach, with no cancellation), and lists every one.
5. **M32 baseline.** P1's observation `RF-LARGE-CHAIN-n1000`, about 21 s and about 3.7 GB peak RSS under RLIMIT_AS 6 GiB on main's dense assembly, is recorded as the M32 baseline.

## Rulings on V1's BACKCHECK_R3 (ROOT, 2026-09-26, after `ef9cf487e`)

Input: [REVIEW/BACKCHECK_R3.md](REVIEW/BACKCHECK_R3.md). Verdict FINDINGS, nothing blocking. These rulings fold into D1's DESIGN revision 4, which also carries D5_TRIGGER, and into D2's revision 4.

- **R3B-1: accepted.** The derived-stress floor gets a pinned propagation factor: √2 for hypot rows, and √2·i for intensified rows, using the row's own i. It must be proven to keep the floor guarantee at 1e-9.
- **R3B-2: accepted.** A closed list of every published row kind, with one class per kind and `not_covered` as the default.
  - Per-case counts of withheld rows are reported in the gate and in P1's survey.
  - The cost that the max_stress headline and the reactions become `not_covered` on the ordinary pressure route is stated explicitly. That cost goes into the D-5 owner-impact framing alongside the trigger, because together they determine how much Current a realistic model loses.
- **R3B-3.** The section terms are carried in the receipt as bit strings. That is more robust than pinning every rounding step in three languages.
- **R3B-4.** G5b gains the stress kind, input-derived rows are classified, and G5c checks set equality.
- **R3B-5.** The site list is keyed by function plus match count.
- **N-1 to N-5: applied.**
  - N-1: the 293 and 303 counts are corrected.
  - N-2: the S\* ≥ 2^-988 exactness bound is recorded, and smaller S\* is handled explicitly.
  - N-3: compare classes, not bits.
  - N-4: S11-K's PR record carries the diff sizes.
  - N-5: the refusal codes are aligned.
- **Next.** V1 narrowly backchecks revision 4 together with D5_TRIGGER. That is the last design check before the package.

## D-5 (ROOT, 2026-09-26, after `7dc2655f9`)

Input: [DESIGN_NUMERICS/D5_TRIGGER.md](DESIGN_NUMERICS/D5_TRIGGER.md).

1. **Hard requirement: D1's reading is confirmed.** The VP-ROBUST "no Passed breach" gate names RF-CANCEL's 12 load-fold breaches as S11 exceptions until S11-F lands. They are covered by the S11 no-interim ruling and fixed by S11-K and S11-F, not by D-5. Once S11-F merges, the exceptions are removed and the gate must hold with none.
2. **V1** starts on D5_TRIGGER now, and answers three questions:
   - why the emulated error is 4–8× smaller than the product's observed 2.43;
   - whether EF's extended-precision re-formation can itself be wrong in the band;
   - whether (a2) can miss a formation-class breach that the 51 emulated cases do not represent.

   V1 checks revision 4 narrowly when it lands. That remains the last design check.
3. **D-5: pre-accepted, option O1.** (a2), the formation-error estimate, lands early as K-D5 after K3. It is kernel-local and T1-disjoint, and routes to W1 after F2. No interim measure before K-D5. **O2 is rejected**, because it withholds Current from correct models. Conditions:
   - V1 returns CLEAR on D5_TRIGGER, or its findings are fixed;
   - revision 4's combined withholding figure (D-5 plus R3B-2) does not show broad loss of Current on realistic models; if it does, ROOT takes the combined question to the owner;
   - K-D5's thresholds come from product data, and P1's measured 122 case is a required true positive in K-D5's tests.

ROOT confirms the selection with the package.

## D-15: withholding on today's exact-block-selected cases (ROOT, 2026-09-26, after `e94af71f2`)

**Not an owner question.** The gate-condition-3 ruling already decides it: a successor's standing must be no worse than the retiring identity's, case by case. If W1's successor would withhold 10–77% of the rows that physics-source-1 publishes as Current today (for example 62 of 82 for N05), that is worse. So exact-block selection is not retired for any domain where that holds.

- **Ordering.** Option A (withholding) is never allowed to cause a regression. Where the successor would withhold rows that are Current today, exact-block selection stays the selected method, and W1 does not replace it, until C (interval binding, owned by D2 as DD-13) or a proven B restores no-worse standing for those rows.
- **B is permitted only as a proof-carrying exemption.** A row is exempt only when it is exactly zero by construction, from a structural decoupling proven from the model's topology and restraints, not merely observed as 0.0. D1 and D2 may use it wherever that proof is mechanical; everything else waits for C.
- **Recommendation: C**, as D1 recommends. It goes into the package with its cost and slice.
- **The gate report shows the per-case withheld counts for both identities side by side**, so condition 3 is checked mechanically.
- V1's final narrow pass checks D-15's figures and this ordering. D2 mirrors D1's table additions: `input_derived` for prescribed-DOF displacement rows and echoed-input review kinds, and the `non_quantity` class.

## T1 merged (ROOT, 2026-09-26)

T1's PR963 is on main as `5aa4285c2`. The T1-overlap hold is lifted. origin/main is merged into the T3 branch before the first product-wiring slice (S11-F, then S-D and the rest). The numerics worktree's product basis moves from `c61a540ea` to `5aa4285c2` at that merge, and D1 and V1 cite the new line numbers from then on. S11-K opens its PR against main once I1 returns, and diffs T1's merged fixtures as pre-registered.

### D-15 option C (ROOT, crossing message)

**ROOT rules C within delegated correctness authority**, under one binding constraint.

- **Conservative binding.** A rule bound to q ± b is satisfied only if it holds for every value in [q − b, q + b]. Otherwise it fails or reads indeterminate. It can never turn a failing check into a passing one.
- **Why no owner question arises.** With that constraint, C affects only rows that would otherwise be withheld under A. It restores their usability with a verified bound, b = 2^-64·S\*, and does not change how any currently covered row binds. It is a correctness-preserving restoration of today's capability, not a new product semantic. An owner question would arise only if C changed how covered rows bind, or let a bound-straddling result pass.
- **Gate condition 3 is tightened** to compare row-level standing: per-case withheld counts for both identities, not just envelope standing.
- V1's BACKCHECK_R4 checks the conservative-binding rule, including its indeterminate case, and whether any withheld row is a nonzero value a user would rely on.
- This goes into the selection package.

## S-H and S11-F ordering (ROOT, 2026-09-26): a hard constraint

Context: P1's secondary observation. The historical typed entry (`run_linear_static_preview_with_mode`, reached from headless `run_preview_in_memory_mode`) publishes the G=1e80 RF-CANCEL cases as M03 Passed, with the net lost or grossly wrong. For example, RF-CANCEL-UDL-W1e80 publishes a rotation of 1.2e57 rad against an expected 4.6e-16 rad. Today the captured entry refuses these cases at capture (V1-S5). D2's S-H would let them solve on the captured route.

1. **S-H never lands before S11-F.** They may land in the same PR. If they are separate, S-H's PR must have S11-F already on main, and its tests must re-run the 1e80 RF-CANCEL cases through the captured route and show them repaired.
2. **S11-F's tests cover both entries:** the captured route (with S-H present if they land together), and the historical typed entry via headless `run_preview_in_memory_mode`. The tests include RF-CANCEL at 1e80 (F, M, ORTHO, INPLANE, UDL-W1e80). D1 confirms that the ledger sits in the shared `solve_load_case` path for both entries.
3. **The VP-ROBUST "no Passed breach" gate runs its cases through both entries.** The S11 exceptions are removed only when both entries are clean.
4. **P1's observation is recorded as secondary.** It is within the adopted S11 bound at an unrealistic ratio, and the typed route cannot mint Current, so it causes no reopen. Recorded fact: the headless typed route publishes M03 quality Passed on gross-wrong values at ratios ≥ 2^53, and S11-F is what removes it.

## D5_CHECK: BLOCKING on D5C-1 (ROOT, 2026-09-26, after `9f792d741`)

1. **D5C-1: V1's fix is adopted.** EF = K⁻¹(f − K_int·u), with the intended-system residual formed as one exact sum over re-formed contributions and the S11 ledger, reusing the FK intended-action audit machinery. **The O1 pre-acceptance stands,** conditional on V1 confirming the fixed EF in the final pass: no misses on V1's sweeps (the 230 absorbed-soft-spring cases and the 105 solve-error cases), plus P1's 122 case.
2. **The no-interim ruling is unchanged.** Its terms still hold: the committed fixtures are clean, and the realistic models are at 1.5e-13 or better. **Correction recorded:** the Passed-band breach class on main is broad in synthetic space. It covers axis-aligned soft springs and solve error at up to about 4e-9 relative, with cond between about 1e6 and 6.7e7. It is not a single case.
3. **K-D5 priority rises, and it moves ahead of K2a.** K2a only affects extreme sub-2^-1022 stiffness, while K-D5 guards a broad Passed-band class. The order becomes **S11-K → K-D5 → K2a → K1 → K2b → K5**, if the exact-residual EF does not need K3's Wide type. If it does, the order is **S11-K → K3 (the part K-D5 needs) → K-D5 → K2a**. D1 states which applies.
4. **Should-fix items.** D5C-2 to D5C-5 and N-3 go into revision 5. **D5C-2:** any stiffness contribution EF cannot re-form (curved, user matrix, joint) makes the case not eligible for Passed through K-D5; it is demoted until coverage exists. Silence is not acceptable. D1 reports whether this over-demotes any committed fixture.

## BACKCHECK_R4 (ROOT, 2026-09-26, after `e27181fb2`)

Input: [REVIEW/BACKCHECK_R4.md](REVIEW/BACKCHECK_R4.md). BLOCKING only through D5C-1, which is already ruled; everything else is SHOULD-FIX. These rulings go into D1's revision 5 and D2's alignment revision.

- **R4-1: accepted.** The span-statics rows use k = 2√2 for the circular maximum and k = 4 for the open-formula summary, because the moment is rebuilt from one end's actions. The floor is proven at 1e-9 with those k.
- **R4-2: accepted, per the D-15 ruling.**
  - Retirement is domain by domain, and the condition is row-level: side-by-side per-case withheld counts, not envelope standing.
  - F2 does not retire exact-block in any domain where the successor withholds rows that are Current today. By V1's counts that includes multicase signed-companion and T1 eigen_motion, where 11 and 23 relied-upon non-zero values are involved (soft-support reaction moments, member torques, torsional shear).
  - **Coexistence rule:** no W1 attempt in an invocation where exact-block selects any case, so one envelope never mixes methods.
  - D1 corrects "almost all exact zeros" for those two cases.
- **R4-3: accepted. This is what the conservative-binding constraint requires.** D2's C design needs:
  - sound interval evaluation over the rule formula language (abs, divide, not, equal and the rest), with a three-valued pass / fail / indeterminate outcome, where indeterminate never counts as pass;
  - scope limited to `absolute_verified` rows;
  - b taken from the receipt, with outward-rounded endpoints;
  - an honest statement of the basis of b;
  - gate-count semantics for indeterminate.

  A formula operator that cannot be evaluated soundly makes the rule indeterminate.
- **R4-4: the tables are aligned.**
  - The intensified k_i rounds upward (conservative), so D1 changes to D2's rule.
  - All 11 mismatches resolve to one table, with D1's closed table as the source and D2 mirroring it.
  - D1 fixes its §5 inconsistency: twist and extension scales are harness-only, not in the receipt.
- **Also:**
  - D2 mirrors N-2;
  - the "no Passed breach" gate carries the named S11 exceptions as (case, quantity) pairs and runs through both entries (`b6fe1eb75`).
- **Next.** D1's revision 5 and D2's alignment revision get V1's narrow re-pass: the fixed EF on the 230, 105 and 122 cases, R4-1 to R4-4, and D-15. That is the last design check before the package.

## Main merged into the T3 branch

The manager merged origin/main (at `0883c2108`, which contains T1's `5aa4285c2`) into the T3 branch as `303609725`, after BACKCHECK_R4 returned and before any product-wiring slice. From here, D1, D2 and V1 cite product line numbers at the merged tree.

## I1's S11-K stop-rule report (ROOT, 2026-09-26)

Context: I1 stopped under the fixture stop rule.
- **A (pre-registered):** T1's support-motion fixtures, as expected.
- **B1 (unregistered):** 6 values per file in `fixtures/results/preview_physics_invented_{dense,sparse}.json` change, about 4 ulp from the live E4/E6 exact station sums, plus a near-zero stress moving at roundoff scale.
- **B2 (unregistered):** T1's `load_reference_fallback_uz` raws change their Debug residual text, from KS1–KS3.
- **B3 (informational):** a qualification input's Debug text changes.
- **C (regression):** `validation/benchmarks/nonlinear` `multisupport_acceptance_inventory_uses_narrow_dec_046_policy` fails with a 2.6e-16 N residual against DEC-046's exact-zero limit. The nonlinear active-set loop prescribes nonzero closed-gap displacements, so KS1–KS3 are live on main there, contrary to S11 §4.6 and §8.1.

**Rulings:**

- **C: option (c), provided I1 confirms a clean separation.**
  - The nonlinear loop's closed-gap prescribed solves call a named, unchanged binary64 legacy function. Linear callers get the exact KS1–KS3 path.
  - A test pins the nonlinear loop to the legacy variant.
  - If the separation isn't clean, option (a) applies: KS exact on the typed path only, with the S11B-1 fix going live with S11-F. (c) is tried first.
  - **DEC-046's zero limits are not touched (option (b) rejected).** They are protected and T5-owned.
  - **Recorded as T5 open work:** the nonlinear loop's closed-gap prescribed solves stay binary64 until T5 designs its residual policy, together with the friction fold. S11-F's design states the same.
  - D1 corrects S11 §4.6 and §8.1 in revision 5: KS sites are live on main in the nonlinear loop. V1 covers this in its re-pass. **Lesson recorded:** both the design and its review missed the nonlinear loop's nonzero prescribed values. The checks must look for every caller of a changed kernel function, not only the product's linear path.
- **B1: accepted as the intended repair.** Before regenerating, I1 lists every TS, Python and result_export test or fixture that pins these bytes, measures the diff of every derived document of A and B1, and reports both to ROOT. Regeneration is by the actual producer only, never by hand, and the S11-K change record discloses it with sizes.
- **B2:** under (c), it is added to the pre-registered list (same class as A).
- **A:** proceeds as pre-registered. Its derived documents are included in the measured diff report before regeneration.
- **B3:** recorded as informational.

## D5C-5: the S11 exception list (ROOT, 2026-09-26, after `490f02982`)

- The S11 exceptions in the VP-ROBUST "no Passed breach" gate are exactly P1's recorded (entry, case, quantity) triples, pinned per entry: **106 triples in 13 cases on the captured entry, and 168 in 22 cases on the typed entry.** They include RF-CANCEL-UDL-W1e8. ROOT's earlier "12" was a miscount.
- The list must be empty after S11-F.
- It is re-pinned from P1's final `results.json` once P1 re-evaluates against the frozen references.
- **Any triple outside the list is a gate failure, not a new exception.**

## BACKCHECK_R5 (ROOT, 2026-09-26, after `0874bed35`)

Input: [REVIEW/BACKCHECK_R5.md](REVIEW/BACKCHECK_R5.md). Verdict FINDINGS, nothing blocking. **The D5C-1 condition is met, so O1 is final, subject to R5-4.**

1. **R5-3 (urgent, for I1).** The KS caller list also covers:
   - `product_equilibrium::evaluate`, which calls `evaluate_original_residual` (KS3) from the nonlinear loop (nonlinear lib.rs:1957) and from SA:1030;
   - `linear_supports::apply_linear_supports`, which calls KS2 (linear_supports lib.rs:467, :487), used by the mechanics benchmarks with imposed displacements (6 sites).

   Option (c) applies to both. Every nonlinear-loop caller, including `product_equilibrium` on the loop path, is pinned to the legacy binary64 variant with a pinning test. For SA:1030 and `linear_supports`, I1 reports whether they are linear callers. If they are, they get the exact path, and any benchmark or fixture bit change goes through the stop rule and is reported to ROOT before regeneration. D1 corrects the S11 caller list.
2. **R5-1: V1's one-rule fix to `b_proof` is accepted** (the reaction rule for loaded fixed-fixed members). D1 adopts it, and D2's S-J mirrors it. Committed proven counts are unchanged.
3. **R5-2.** `input_derived_dofs` is exactly the kernel's non-free DOFs, with the product's family rule stated explicitly. Spring hangers and constant-effort supports are free DOFs carrying applied force or stiffness, not rigid.
4. **R5-5: accepted.** Condition 3 adds a check-level comparison: the committed rule packs run under both identities, and the successor must not turn a decided check (pass or fail) into indeterminate. Where it does, that domain does not retire.
5. **N-1.** b is the exact point only when S\* = 0. For 0 < S\* < 2^-1011, b is rounded up to the smallest positive subnormal, not 0. **N-2 to N-6:** applied.
6. **R5-4: data first.** D5C-2 demotes every Passed invocation containing a realized DEC-070 curved bend until W1c, and real piping models usually have elbows. Before ROOT decides whether this goes to the owner, D1 provides the following, and V1 checks it:
   - how a user realizes a curved bend today (default or opt-in), and whether any committed or realistic invented model uses one;
   - how many realistic models would lose Current;
   - whether a bound-based alternative for curved contributions is feasible now, without T4, and its cost. Examples: re-forming the curved element's stiffness in Wide precision from its inputs for EF, or a documented formation-error bound for the curved element;
   - whether T4's null-space confirmation is a prerequisite for that.

   If a sound alternative exists within T3, ROOT selects it. Otherwise ROOT takes "demote realized curved bends until T4/W1c" to the owner, with the numbers. **The package may be assembled around R5-4, with R5-4 flagged as open.**

### R5-4 and process (ROOT, crossing message)

- **R5-4: proceed as the manager proposed.**
  - D1 designs a conservative formation-error bound for curved contributions, entered into EF, so a model is demoted only when the bound threatens 1e-9.
  - D1 counts the committed and realistic invented models that realize curved bends, and states whether T4's null-space confirmation is a prerequisite for the bound.
  - V1 checks that the bound is sound.
- **If no sound bound exists within T3,** ROOT receives owner options with numbers and takes them to the owner with its recommendation. ROOT's current leaning:
  - it recommends against (b), exempting with a caveat, which is a silent pass with a note;
  - it leans to (a), demote until W1c, if the affected models are few;
  - it leans to (c), delay K-D5, only if (a) would demote most realistic models.
- **Process: agreed.** One narrow D1/D2 follow-up covers R5-1, R5-2, R5-5, N-1 to N-6 and R5-3 (the S11 caller list). V1 verifies only those fixes and R5-4's bound. Then the selection package is assembled, with no further full review round.

## S11 exception re-pin (ROOT, 2026-09-26, after P1's follow-up `d28f69dd7`): supersedes the counts in D5C-5

- **Correction.** The "106 captured / 168 typed" counts in D5C-5 above were not P1's record. They came from D1's *prediction* script `DESIGN_NUMERICS/_run_records/s11_exceptions.py` (revision 5). That script takes every quantity key of each case's discriminating R1 negative control. Those keys include the midspan bending magnitudes `Mb.M1.mid` and `Mb.M2.mid`, which are reference quantities but not product results: P1 counts them `not_published`. Removing those 46 predicted triples (20 `Mb.M1.mid` and 26 `Mb.M2.mid`) gives P1's observed set exactly. No observed breach lies outside the prediction. D1's text and this record then quoted the prediction as "P1's record". The error was the attribution; the prediction itself was stated as a prediction.
- **The re-pinned list** is `GATE/S11_EXCEPTIONS.json`, generated by `GATE/pin_s11_exceptions.py` from P1's final `DETECTION/results.json` (sha256 `a1188624…`). It covers frozen-reference cases only, as (entry, case, quantity) triples:
  - **captured: 88 triples in 13 cases;**
  - **typed: 140 triples in 22 cases.** That is the same 88 (the typed entry is bit-identical to the captured entry on those cases), plus the 52 triples from the nine G = 1e80 cases the captured entry refuses at capture.
  - P1's own probes (S11-PROBE-A-*) and V1-CHECK-L-* are excluded. The probes become S11-K/F test cases with exact expected nets.
- **RF-SKEW-T-CANT-OFF-122-r1e-04 is not an exception.** It is K-D5's required true positive on both entries.
- The list must be empty after S11-F, and any triple outside it is a gate failure. That is unchanged.
- The 106/168 figures in `DESIGN_NUMERICS/DESIGN.md` (D5C-5 row, §4.10), `S11_CONTAINMENT.md` (the D5C-5 row, §8) and `D5_TRIGGER.md` are superseded here, and D1 corrects them in revision 5a.

## R5-4: curved bends under K-D5 (ROOT, 2026-09-26, on D1's note `4bc3e0696`)

- **Pre-accepted.** EF re-forms curved contributions in `Wide<2>` from their binary64 inputs, as an objective element built from the actual chord. The Wide arctangent is added to K3a. No owner question arises, and options (a), (b) and (c) fall away.
- **Final acceptance depends on V1's targeted verification:**
  - the re-formation is sound and rotation-consistent by construction;
  - it misses none of the 4 curved Passed breaches on main;
  - it demotes none of the 12 realistic elbow case-modes (E1–E6);
  - reusing the product's binary64 curved matrix misses 2 of the 4, so re-formation is required.
- **Findings recorded** (STAGE0_MAP §6):
  - Main publishes curved-bend Passed breaches (4, up to 1.48×). This is an M03 extension in the skew class, under the no-interim ruling; K-D5 is the fix.
  - The product's curved element is not rotation-consistent on binary64 inputs. It is routed to T4 and W1c, and goes into T4's graph row in the next records PR.
- D5C-2's demotion stays as the fail-closed default for any future family EF cannot re-form.

## D-14 scope: self-weight (ROOT, 2026-09-26, after `28d96084f`)

- ROOT agrees with the manager's reading. Generated self-weight is an authoring-time model operation that writes a `distributed_force` intensity into the model document, where the user can see and edit it. It is therefore the model's input, not a solve-time derivation.
- D-14's exact-from-inputs rule applies only to the solve-time seismic and wind equivalent-static generators. No owner options are needed.
- The other RF-ELOAD definition answers (`MANAGER_NOTES/RF_ELOAD_DEFINITIONS.md`) are accepted.

## D-14 slice correction and revision 5a (ROOT, 2026-09-26, after `16bcbf369`)

- **Correction.** D-14's equivalent-static extension goes in **F3**, with the W1b element-load work, not F2b. ROOT's "F2b" was a slip: generated equivalent-static loads are uniform element loads and need W1b's element-load machinery. It lands atomic with F3's RF-ELOAD gate. Until then, the case is refused as `equivalent-static unsupported`. D1's revision 5a already places it this way.
- The rest of D1's revision 5a (`16bcbf369`) stands as ruled. It goes to D2 for revision 5b, then to V1's targeted verification.

## D2 revision 5b choices (ROOT, 2026-09-26, after `41f018355`)

1. **Undecided counting: accepted.** In the check-level gate (R5-5), withheld-row refusals count as undecided. This is conservative and correct: a check the user could decide yesterday and cannot today is a regression, whatever the reason.
2. **Nonlinear-support rule: accepted, narrowed.** It must never refuse the solve. A case with a nonlinear support is **not selected** for W1 or the retained-precision route, so it gets no proof and no successor identity. It keeps its ordinary result with its ordinary standing, exactly as today. This is T5's domain, and T3 must not remove a result the product publishes today.
   - D2 narrows its rule to that: `INPUT_DOF_MISMATCH` may apply only where a receipt *claims* selection of such a case, as a reader integrity refusal of the receipt, never of the ordinary result.
   - D1 mirrors it in the W1 selection rule, together with the trimmed/untrimmed support-family detail D2 took from `PP`.
   - V1 checks both.

## RF-ELOAD refutation (V3) rulings (ROOT, 2026-09-26, after `3bb46bc62`)

- **D-14 clarification (V3 Q2 / F3).** "Computed exactly from the user's inputs" means exact from the **binary64 inputs as the document stores them** (D1 §4.2). It is the same principle as re-forming stiffness from binary64 primitives. The authored decimal text is not the source. The represented basis for RF-ELOAD-CANCEL-SEIS-G1e7 and -G1e8 stands.
- **V3 Q1 / F1: add a variant; do not edit G1e8.** The author adds RF-ELOAD-CANCEL-SEIS-G1e8-R (ROOT's second message; its first said "G1e8b") with V3's inputs (gen.g_factor.Z = −0.23, D = 143.44076231504138435), on the represented basis. Expected: NC-FLOAT-SUM fails about 9.44×, NC-BIN64-PRODUCT about 89.6×, finite_input about 8.55e-9. Every existing case and value stays byte-identical. G1e8's NC-FLOAT-SUM control is relabelled as the benign-rounding case.
- **In the same revision:**
  - F1 text: the NC-FLOAT-SUM control text and README finding 3 say what the control rounds.
  - F8: retire NC-LOST-SOFT at r1e-06.
  - F4–F6: the control texts specify the defect exactly as V3 found it (the lever rule lumps full-span loads 50/50; ALPHA-TIMES-INTERVAL and SUBTRACT-DILATIONS drop the fit; COMB-DIFF's NC-MAG-SUM is |Mb_A − Mb_B|; corrected 2026-09-26 by ROOT after V3's delta check at `1daa512d4`, where V3 withdrew its F6 misreading; ROOT's ruling text had said "Mb_A − Mb_B").
  - V3's §6.2 labels on the 21 kept controls, and its re-scale decision.
  - F9: a symmetric CANCEL-FEM gross column, or one labelled review-only.
  - F10: a README harness-mapping note (station labels under an i/j swap; tp_phys_008's N sign).
  - F7: no change to the rule, which V3 rules sound and ROOT accepts. The README says it is a new rule, since R1 refuses that case.
- **Check.** V3 re-refutes the delta only: the new case by its own route, the changed or retired controls, and byte identity of every pre-existing value. Then RF-ELOAD comes to ROOT for selection, before F3.
- **Carried into F3's brief (D-14):** a **required** kernel-level test that each generated load enters the ledger as the exact product of its binary64 inputs at working precision, with no binary64 intermediate. No non-cancelling reference can observe D-14.

## RF-ELOAD selection (ROOT, 2026-09-26)

RF-ELOAD revision 1 at `b6927f783` is selected and frozen: see `ROOT_SELECTION_RF_ELOAD.md`. The N1 and N2 wording errata are recorded there and not applied. The COMB-DIFF ruling-text correction to |Mb_A − Mb_B| (dated above) is ROOT's.

## K3a arctangent and host disk (ROOT, 2026-09-26)

- **K3a arctangent: accepted.** I2's proved bound of 23.6 ulp at p = 128 satisfies `ROOT_SELECTION_DESIGNS.md` C1 as a proof. The measured worst, 5.41 ulp over I2's wider angle set (V1 measured 2.69 over 13 angles), is recorded alongside it. The test tolerance covers 5.41 and stays at or below 23.6.
- **Disk.** ROOT deleted finished scratch (t3-p1, which matches the committed DETECTION/RETURN.md, and T1's WP7 scratch copy). The floor stays at about 8 GB. Once RV1 has returned and no cargo process is using them, the manager may prune `t3-target`, delete t3-s11k scratch if S11-K needs no fixes, and delete `<scratch>/rv1-s11k-scratch`. `<wt>/engine` is left alone, because it is the node_modules source for the desktop tests.

## S11-K regeneration and hash-pin approvals (ROOT, 2026-09-26, on I1's pre-regeneration report `14354efdb`)

ROOT relayed these decisions by SendMessage; they are recorded here as relayed. The recording was late: RV1's S3 found it missing (`REVIEW/S11K_REVIEW.md`, `65e98c259`). The substance was verified by RV1 on the candidate.

1. **Regeneration: approved.** "Regenerate A, B1 and B2 with their producers, and then the 12 derived files with the §5 producers. Producers only, no hand edits. The change record discloses every size, and I1 explains the sparse invocation_work publication_charged −12."
2. **Hash pins: approved.** "I1's write set extends to the two hash-pin constants (result_export/tests/load_reference_contract.rs and tests/test_load_reference_readers.py FROZEN), in the same PR, with old → new hashes disclosed. They pin exactly the pre-registered A raws."
3. **TS suite:** "yes, run the full desktop suite locally before the PR." The package-lock at the S11-K head was byte-identical to the engine worktree's, so node_modules was symlinked from there rather than running `npm ci`, and the links were removed before committing. The desktop vitest and build were run after regeneration.
4. **The index touch:** "noted and accepted as harmless. The rule stands: no Git writes by TASKs."

**Then (ROOT):** the S11-K PR needs an independent review of the full diff (the §8.1 items, the R3 fixes, R5-3's caller classification, the option-(c) pins), hosted CI, the full dual-viewport dispatch, and a clean DEC-025 sweep. **PR scope (ROOT, later):** option (b), a fresh branch off origin/main (`codex/piping-s11k-pr-20260926`), carrying the S11-K commits only.

## I4's F12 stop: formation-class exceptions and slice S11-G (ROOT, 2026-09-27, option (c))

I4 (S11-F) held F12 correctly: S11-F clears 221 of the 228 pinned triples. The remaining 7 are formation and formed-term errors, not load absorption, so the ledger cannot repair them.

1. **Re-pin, and a correction of the record.**
   - **The correction.** P1's class heuristic and the 2026-09-26 re-pin misclassified these 7 triples as S11 class. They are pre-existing on main (P1 baseline), and S11-F makes none of them worse. I4 shows each is bit-identical, or no worse, between base and candidate.
   - **The re-pin.** The 7 are moved into a separate, exactly pinned formation-class list, `GATE/FORMATION_EXCEPTIONS.json`: 7 triples, 14 rows as (entry, case, quantity, mode).
     - RF-CANCEL-UDL-W1e80 th.S1.RZ (typed): load formation.
     - RF-CANCEL-UDL-W1e8 th.S1.RZ (captured and typed): load formation.
     - RF-CANCEL-F-G1e80-GnG-INPLANE Mb.M1.j and Mb.M2.i (typed): formed K_e·u.
     - RF-CANCEL-M-G1e80-GnG-INPLANE Mb.M2.i and Mb.M2.j (typed): formed K_e·u.
   - **The S11 list** (`GATE/S11_EXCEPTIONS.json`) is now 221 triples: 87 in 12 cases captured, 134 in 18 cases typed. It must be **empty after S11-F** (F12 in its literal form). The gate fails on any triple outside the two lists. Both lists are generated by `GATE/pin_s11_exceptions.py` from P1's results.
2. **The reopen trigger is met.** The INPLANE rows exceed 1e-7 relative, and UDL-W1e80 publishes 1.2e57 rad as Passed on the typed entry. That meets the no-interim reopen trigger, so the interim response is a formation-noise guard, **slice S11-G**, without waiting for F2 and F3.
   - D1 writes a narrow design note: the **load-row guard first** (Σ over *formed* terms of |term|·(formation bound), against 1e-9·max(|net|, scale)), then the **recovery-side guard** on formed K_e·u end actions, as a second part or a small follow-on.
   - **The note distinguishes formed terms from input terms.** A nodal load or other exactly represented input carries zero formation noise, so legitimate exact-input cancellation (including the 221 triples S11-F repairs) is never demoted.
   - It is fail-closed: demote to Sensitive, never refuse, and no new envelope field. If a field would be needed, it stops and goes to ROOT.
   - **V1 checks the note:** all 7 caught; none of the 221 repaired triples, and no RF-CANCEL, RF-SKEW or committed-fixture row, demoted; and the committed-byte forecast.
3. **Sequencing.**
   - S11-F lands first, with the formation-class pin.
   - S11-G is implemented next, on main after S11-F, and lands **before F2 and F3 and before any W1 retirement**.
   - The formation list is empty when S11-G lands, or the note justifies, per row, why that row waits for F2/F3's exact formation; if so, it goes to ROOT.
   - K-D5 may land before or after S11-G, whichever is ready first, with the PP conflict boundary named.
4. **Smaller items:**
   - F10 runs under the test-only historical pressure scope, recorded as such.
   - N05's transverse-tip retained-replay budget overflow: confirmed on base, it is pre-existing, recorded and routed to T3's N05 item. If it is a regression, S11-F stops.

## S11-F fixture stop: conditional pre-approval of regeneration (ROOT, 2026-09-27; recorded before regeneration)

ROOT relayed this by SendMessage; it is recorded here as relayed, before any regeneration (the lesson from S11-K's S3). If the measured pre-regeneration report (`IMPLEMENTATION/S11F/PRE_REGENERATION_REPORT.md`) meets these conditions, I4 regenerates without coming back to ROOT. If any condition fails, I4 stops and the report goes to ROOT.

**A (load_reference/connected): approved.** "Regenerate the raws, their derived documents and the two hash pins, by the actual producers only," provided the pre-regeneration report shows all of the following:
- every changed leaf is Debug/diagnostic text, a digest or hash, or a work unit derived from text length (like S11-K's −12);
- no published result value and no status or diagnostic code moves;
- the hash pins' old → new values are stated;
- every pinning test is identified and green after regeneration.

**B (physics_thermal_ui_model): approved**, provided all of the following:
- I4 names the actual producer, and shows it reproduces the committed dense file byte for byte on base;
- S11-F's changes are only the listed reaction residues: a restrained-DOF support_reaction component and its magnitude, at noise level (well under 1e-9 of the case's load scale), with no status change;
- the line-2709 sparse drift is explained (producer, commit or platform) and disclosed separately in the change record as pre-existing drift corrected by regeneration, not as an S11-F effect;
- all named consumers (result_export physics_contract and physics_source_contract, the three Python tests, the desktop parity test) are green after regeneration.
"If no producer reproduces the committed files on base, stop and bring me the provenance question before regenerating B."

**Both:** regeneration is by the producers only, and the regenerated bytes must equal the pre-regeneration measurement byte for byte. S11-F's CHANGE_RECORD cites this entry.

## Amendment: the "no worse" condition for formation-class rows (ROOT, 2026-09-27)

I4's base-against-candidate comparison of the 14 formation rows: UDL-W1e80 is bit-identical; the four INPLANE triples are much better (about 1e9× → 628–5767× the criterion); **the 4 UDL-W1e8 th.S1.RZ rows (captured and typed, dense and sparse) are 3% worse (46.47× → 47.99×).** The cause is that the FEM terms carry formation error, S11-F publishes their exact correctly rounded net (0.4916666902601719), and base's binary64 fold happened to land slightly closer to the intended 0.49166666666666667.

- **Amended condition for formation-class rows:** the published value is the correctly rounded net of the represented terms, **and** the row stays exactly pinned in `GATE/FORMATION_EXCEPTIONS.json`.
- **The 3% worsening is recorded** in S11-F's CHANGE_RECORD, in the formation list's entry for those rows (`GATE/pin_s11_exceptions.py` and `FORMATION_EXCEPTIONS.json`), and here. The 10 bit-identical-or-better rows are disclosed as such.
- **S11-G's load-row guard is required to catch all 4 UDL-W1e8 rows** (added to D1's S11-G brief).
- **N05:** the transverse-tip retained-replay budget overflow is pre-existing on base in both modes, and routed to T3's N05 item. Accepted.

## S11-G note: rulings, conditional on V1's check (ROOT, 2026-09-27, on `633460fb4`)

- **(a) The exact signed defect instead of the a-priori Σ|term|·bound: accepted.** D1 showed the a-priori form fails its own coverage conditions: it demotes UDL-W1e5 and probe A. **The exact defect must itself be computed exactly, with no binary64 intermediate.** V1 confirms that, and confirms that the stated-bound fallback (curved consistent vectors, exact-pressure operands) is conservative.
- **(b) The 8 INPLANE rows wait for F2: accepted provisionally.** The reopen trigger is met, so this does not rest on D1's word alone. V1 must establish:
  - (i) that the INPLANE class is reachable only at synthetic scales on the typed entry (the captured entry refuses it), and that D1's scan of realistic and committed models shows no row near the criterion by this mechanism;
  - (ii) which 16 case-modes R-b would falsely demote, and whether they are realistic or committed models, or synthetic.
  **If (i) fails, or if R-b's false demotions are all synthetic, R-b ships in S11-G:** fail-closed availability loss on synthetic cases beats wrong Passed values. Otherwise the 8 rows re-point to "F2 (W1a)", F2 is required to empty them, and **F2 is prioritized as the next facade slice after S11-G**.
- **(c) Case-level demotion (with source_eligible = false for a fired case): accepted.** It fails closed; case-scoped standing is T6's.
- **The S11-G PR must show a zero regeneration diff, or it stops.**

## S11-G after V1's S11G_CHECK (ROOT, 2026-09-27, on `30233f93a`)

- **(b)(i) failed, so R-b ships in S11-G.** V1 showed the INPLANE mechanism is reachable through an ordinary authored nodal load on the captured entry, and in the realistic RF-LARGE-CONT-n00100 at 202–25984× the row-relative criterion. V1's classification shows R-b is mostly right: of its 16 extra case-modes, 8 (WEAK, LARGE-CONT) are genuinely wrong rows, and only 8 (LFRAME, synthetic) are false demotions, which are acceptable. **The 8 INPLANE formation rows stay in S11-G's scope, not F2's.**
- **D1 writes S11-G note revision 2:**
  1. **B-1:** add R-b and forecast it by script against every committed fixture case-mode (P1 estimates row noise above 1e-9 in 30 of 114).
     - For each case-mode where R-b fires, report whether the row really is wrong against an exact reference, or is a false positive, and which of them K-D5 already demotes (so redundancy is known).
     - **If R-b fires on any committed fixture, that is a status change under the stop rule** and goes to ROOT with per-row evidence before implementation. Truly wrong rows being demoted is the intended repair (likely approved, with disclosure); false positives need a refined rule.
  2. **SF-1:** the defect is computed in one exact accumulator with no binary64 intermediates, in the specification as well as the script.
  3. **SF-2:** the fallback bounds are genuinely conservative. That means the exact-pressure operands' actual rounding count, and the curved bound including cond(F), cancellation and libm, or those contributions routed to "cannot bound", which demotes.
  4. **SF-3:** T10 is non-vacuous (a case whose ordinary solve runs recovery), so that M7 and M8 are killed.
  5. **SF-4: fixed, not just disclosed.** A pure-thermal or pure-pressure straight run between anchors must not be demoted. Fix the free-row scale collapse (for example with a floor tied to element-level force magnitudes or the intended loads), and pin V1's probe as a test that must stay silent.
  6. **The NOTEs:** the INPLANE labels corrected against I4's records, and "the error is in u" corrected to V1's figures.
- **V1 then checks revision 2:** B-1's forecast, the SF items, SF-4's fix, and no committed fixture falsely demoted. The zero-regeneration-diff rule stands, except for demotions ROOT approves under point 1.
- S11-F is unaffected and proceeds.
- **Clarifications (ROOT, 2026-09-27):**
  - (i) SF-4 is a required fix: the S* floor, or an equivalent, is in the design. V1's collinear-run probe is a test that stays silent, and all 6 UDL rows stay caught.
  - (ii) R-b is decided on evidence. D1 forecasts at least **R-b** as written and **R-b′**, which is R-b restricted to rows at or above the V1-S8 floor (|q| ≥ about 5.4e-11·S*) or the contract floor at that row. Each is run over the committed fixtures, the frozen references and the 221, reporting: the INPLANE rows caught, and whether each is a Passed breach under today's predicate; the false demotions (rows correct under today's predicate), split committed, frozen-realistic and synthetic; and the overlap with K-D5.
  - **Default:** the variant that catches every INPLANE row that is a published Passed breach under today's predicate, with no committed-fixture demotion of a row correct under that predicate. Otherwise the numbers go to ROOT.

## S11-G note revision 2: rulings, conditional on V1's delta check (ROOT, 2026-09-27, on `a5137da0f`)

1. **R-b′ selected**, by ROOT's default rule. It catches all 8 INPLANE rows, each a Passed breach under today's predicate; it demotes no committed row that is correct today; and its 12 false demotions are all synthetic. V1 confirms the committed forecast (0 firings) and the synthetic classification of the 12.
2. **SF-4's per-row floor, 2^-10·Σ|self-equilibrated formed terms|: accepted.** V1 confirms that the collinear and pure-pressure runs are silent, that the 6 UDL catches are unchanged, and that the floor cannot be gamed to hide a real formation error (a counterexample search: a row with a real defect below the floor but above the criterion).
3. **SF-2's CannotBound for curved consistent vectors, with its availability loss: accepted.** Realized curved bends are opt-in, and no committed model uses one. The loss is disclosed in S11-G's CHANGE_RECORD, and W1c with T4 removes it.
4. **The formation list is emptied when S11-G merges,** provided S11-G's gate run shows all 14 rows published non-Passed on both entries and both modes. Until then it stays pinned.
5. **K-D5 on INPLANE** (1.6× and 2.0× its trigger in D1's recal): I3 confirms on the merged state. If K-D5 does demote them, the overlap is recorded as defence in depth, not a conflict; S11-G's R-b′ still ships.

After V1's PASS, the manager writes the S11-G implementation brief. S11-G goes on main after S11-F merges. I4's formation_rows.json input is pinned by full hash (`c548f51999b4df16…`) in `DESIGN_NUMERICS/_run_records/inputs/` until I4's commit lands.

## S11-G revision 2 after V1's delta check (ROOT, 2026-09-27, on `a3ddc4dea`)

1. **DB-1 accepted as V1 proposes.** The SF-4 floor applies **only to the self-equilibrated part of the defect**, with two exact accumulators, and a net formation defect is never floored.
   - D1 adds test **T6b** (V1's counterexample: a UDL-type fixed-end defect at a free row, masked by two anchored thermal members; it must fire) and its killing mutation.
   - **Residual accepted for now:** a junction of self-equilibrated terms only, with a genuine small net, is hidden by any noise-silencing floor. It is disclosed in the note and in S11-G's CHANGE_RECORD, and routed to W1/F2, which removes it.
2. **DS-1 accepted. Ruling 5 of "S11-G note revision 2" is amended:** K-D5 does **not** demote the INPLANE cases after S11-F. D1's 1.6× and 2.0× came from recal_d5's pre-S11-F folded force, and V1's exact-residual EF with the S11-F force gives 2·EF ≈ 1.3e-6 to 3.2e-6 of the trigger. **R-b′ is the only catch; there is no defence in depth there.**
   - The note's §1, §5 and §6.4 are corrected.
   - I3 is told to expect K-D5 to stay silent on these cases, and not to "fix" that.
   - R-b′'s tests are therefore load-bearing, and the implementation review mutation-checks them hard.
3. **V1's NOTEs go into the implementation brief:**
   - the underflow condition on the FMA error term;
   - the constant 1e-9 made safe by strict rounding or an exact rational;
   - a source pin tying the routing site to the tested predicate (M7);
   - a skew-member unit test of the bound (the M14 |Tu| variant).
4. **Next:** D1 writes revision 2.1, V1 checks the diff only, and on PASS the manager writes the S11-G implementation brief.

## Selection: the S11-G design (ROOT, 2026-09-27)

**S11-G's design is selected at revision 2.1** (`DESIGN_NUMERICS/S11G_GUARD.md`, sha256 `7c052c9e…`, commit `ba5d26924`), on V1's PASS (`REVIEW/S11G_CHECK.md` delta-2.1, sha256 `a064bc93…`, commit `02d071f88`). ROOT's earlier rulings are its conditions:
- **R-b′** is the recovery guard;
- **the SF-4 floor applies to the self-equilibrated defect only,** with two exact accumulators; a net formation defect is never floored;
- **CannotBound for curved consistent vectors,** with its availability loss disclosed in S11-G's CHANGE_RECORD;
- **the formation list is emptied at S11-G's merge,** provided all 14 rows are published non-Passed on both entries and both modes;
- **R-b′'s tests are load-bearing** (the only INPLANE catch after S11-F);
- **the DN-4 residual** (a self-equilibrated-only junction with a genuine small net) is disclosed, and routed to W1/F2.

V1's two implementation NOTEs go into I5's brief:
- **D21-1:** the exact test |A_net| > 12·(T0 − B), with ±12B and ∓12T0 added exactly into the accumulator copy, and no rounded comparison;
- **D21-2:** the scaled-RoundedProduct underflow fallback is γ2·|value| + |k|·2^-1074.

S11-G is implemented by I5 on main after S11-F merges, and reviewed by RV4.

## K-D5 mutation M31b: accepted as equivalent at the criterion (ROOT, 2026-09-27) — SUPERSEDED

**Superseded (2026-09-27):** this acceptance is withdrawn. See "K-D5 mutation M31b: equivalence withdrawn" below. The text is kept as the record of the earlier ruling.

**The mutant.** M31b is the chord-only form of the design's mutation 31. K_t is still re-formed, but the intended element's H is built from the product's formula chord R(cos φ − 1, R sin φ, 0), using binary64 R, atan2, cos and sin, instead of the actual node chord. The formula evaluated at p (M31b0) also survives. Every other K-D5 mutation is killed: M23, M26, M27, M28, **M31a** (the whole-matrix form, where K_int is the product's binary64 matrix), M32a and M32b.

**Evidence (I3):**
- On CSKEW_8_5, the mutant's trigger equals the correct check's to 4+ digits.
- Admissible radius-mismatch elbow:
  - the centre is shifted −6.5e-10·R, giving |ri| − |rj| = 9.2e-10 relative, inside the product's 1e-9 tolerance;
  - the formula chord differs from the actual chord by about 1.4e-10 m per component, confirmed on an instrumented build;
  - triggers are 1.681 (mutant) against 1.685 (correct);
  - the chord error moves EF by about 0.002 of the criterion.
- **The mechanism:** a rigid-rotation force pair from a chord error has only a second-order net moment on the soft mode.
- **Consistency:** this agrees with V1's `REVIEW/VERIFY_R5.md` item 16, which reproduced mutation 31 only through the shared matrix.

**Ruling: option (a) accepted.** M31b is recorded as an equivalent mutant at the unchanged 1e-9 criterion. Nothing is weakened. The conditions are:
1. **What stays required:**
   - the test `kd5_curved_intended_element_uses_the_actual_chord` (the admissible-mismatch elbow, k_X = 30; it demotes in both modes and kills M31a);
   - M31a's kill;
   - the actual-chord implementation (R5-4 §2 step 6).

   The equivalence is about the test's power, not the implementation: the code must still use the actual chord.
2. **The K-D5 reviewer (RV-K-D5) gets a specific attack:** construct an admissible product model on which M31b is observable at the criterion. Candidates include:
   - small bend angles;
   - near-π angles short of the AngleDomain refusal;
   - extreme R/L;
   - stiff-X or soft-Y combinations;
   - the most distorted admissible centre.

   If RV-K-D5 finds such a model, it becomes a required test, and M31b must be killed before merge.
3. **Records:**
   - The equivalence is recorded, with these numbers, in K-D5's RETURN and CHANGE_RECORD and here.
   - The claim in `DESIGN_NUMERICS/R5_4_CURVED.md` and `D5_TRIGGER.md` that "H from the product's chord misses k_X = 8.5" holds only for the whole-matrix form, M31a. It is corrected at the next D1 touch, or noted in the K-D5 record.

## S11-G implementation: I5 rulings (ROOT, 2026-09-27)

These are on I5's three items from base `43b8f83aa`, before any build.

**1. Ordering: accepted, with the manager's condition.**
- **The approach:** R-b′ needs the published rows, which exist only after the straight element-recovery loop. The load-row finding therefore goes in at `append_integrity_report` on both call sites. After the loop, R-b′'s finding amends the same integrity diagnostic, through the same helper and the same no-op rule, and only while its code is still `CHECKS_PASSED`. Diagnostic order and byte layout are unchanged. If both guards fire, the load-row sentence stands.
- **The condition:** I5 enumerates every reader of the diagnostic code, the envelope's `solve_quality` or the case standing between the append and R-b′'s amendment. **Any reader in that window stops the work and comes back to the manager.**
- **Required tests:** R-b′ alone, and both guards firing.

**2. The erratum at B = T0 = 0: accepted.**
- **The change:** the first clause fires on `B > 0 && B ≥ T0`, instead of the design's `B ≥ T0`. The design's own T6 pin (CHECKS_PASSED) decides this. D21-1's exact second test and the A_se third test are unchanged.
- **Required:**
  - boundary tests: B = T0 = 0 with A = 0 does not fire; A_net ≠ 0 fires; |A_se| > 12·Tf fires; B > 0 with B = T0 fires;
  - a mutation restoring the old clause, which T6 must kill;
  - the deviation from S11G_GUARD.md rev 2.1 recorded in CHANGE_RECORD.
- RV4 checks it. No D1 or V1 round is needed, because the change is confined to the degenerate point.

**3. Receipt coverage on the captured entry: option (b), with conditions.**
- **The edge:** a multi-case captured invocation in which one case is source-selected, and another case is demoted from Passed by a guard. `OrdinaryAttempt::wire` then requires the published outcome to equal the ordinary checks_passed, finalization fails, and the invocation is refused with the blocking `SOURCE_BLOCK_RECOVERY_FINALIZATION_FAILED`.
- **Why (b):** "never refuse" in S11-G is a design rule against losing availability. The hard constraint is never publishing a silently wrong value, and this edge fails closed. The proper fix is a receipt contract change, and it belongs with the finalization owner, not inside a guard slice.
- **Conditions:**
  - **(a) Scope of the residual.** I5 checks whether the same refusal already happens on main through S11-F's `LOAD_CONTRIBUTION_ABSORBED` demotion, and through K-D5's formation-check demotion, in a multi-case captured invocation. Record the actual reach per slice. If S11-F already has it on main, it is an existing residual that S11-G widens, and the record says so.
  - **(b) The test.** The pinning test is labelled a characterization of a known residual, not desired behaviour. It asserts that the invocation is refused with the finalization code, that no case value is published, and that single-case captured invocations are demoted and not refused. Its comment references the owning item.
  - **(c) Ownership.** The "demoted-ordinary" receipt form, including the reader update, is routed to T3's composite `SOURCE_BLOCKS_FINALIZATION_FAILED` item. **It must close before T3 closes**; it is not deferred past T3. It goes into the work graph's T3 row in the next records PR.
  - **(d) Disclosure.** It is disclosed in S11-G's CHANGE_RECORD and PR body as a fail-closed availability residual. **RV4 confirms that it fails closed on every reachable path; any path that publishes a value is BLOCKING.**

The cargo token order is unchanged: I4, then I3, then I5.

## S11-G ruling 3, revision 1: path 2 goes back to the design (ROOT, 2026-09-27)

**What I5 found** (from the code, on `3d844fea4`, before any build):
- **The corrected reach (condition a, accepted).** S11-F's `LOAD_CONTRIBUTION_ABSORBED` and K-D5's formation check have **no** receipt residual. Their Sensitive verdict is on the kernel `StructuralReport` (FK `structural.rs:1400` on main; kd5 `structural.rs:1479-1492`), so the case enters routing and gets a receipt entry. S11-G is the only slice with the residual, by two paths:
  - **Path 1:** a Passed case demoted beside a source-selected case. This needs per-case stiffness, because Sensitive otherwise follows the invocation-wide rcond.
  - **Path 2:** the design's routing gate (`source_eligible … && load_row_finding.is_none()`, S11G_GUARD rev 2.1 §3.5). An already-Sensitive case whose load-row guard fires gets no retained-source attempt, and so no receipt entry. Coverage then fails, and the invocation is refused. I5 reports this as reachable in ordinary models, for example an N05-type case beside a formation-noisy second case.

**The revised ruling.** Ruling 3 accepted option (b) on the premise of a narrow edge. Path 2 would refuse whole invocations in ordinary models, which is an availability regression introduced by S11-G, so it is not an acceptable disclosed residual. **S11-G must not ship with path 2.**
1. **Path 2 goes back to the design.** D1 writes a narrow S11G_GUARD delta, **revision 2.2**, limited to the routing gate. It answers:
   - why the design withholds the retained-source attempt from an already-Sensitive case whose load-row guard fires;
   - whether giving that case the attempt is sound, with the guard's Sensitive demotion and diagnostic applied whatever the attempt's outcome, so that receipt coverage holds with no receipt contract change;
   - if that is unsound, the smallest in-design alternative that avoids refusal. A receipt contract change is out of scope for S11-G.

   V1 then runs a delta check. ROOT selects 2.2 on V1's PASS, by the default rule, and I5 implements it. I5 carries on with everything else meanwhile.
2. **Path 1 stays under ruling 3:** a disclosed, fail-closed residual, owned by the composite `SOURCE_BLOCKS_FINALIZATION_FAILED` item, closing before T3 closes. It is preferable for 2.2's fix to remove it too. The characterization test stays for whatever residual remains after 2.2.
3. **Condition (b) remains a gate.** I5's consumer enumeration continues. If any consumer can present, export or qualify rows from a refused envelope, that is BLOCKING whatever 2.2 does, and it comes to ROOT.
4. **Condition (a), the corrected reach, is accepted.** It is recorded in the work graph's T3 row once I5's test confirms it, correcting the earlier framing.

D1 and V1 do writing and analysis only; no cargo unless the manager grants a slot. The cargo order stays I3, then I5.

**Note (ROOT, 2026-09-27, on D1's revision 2.2 at `3c80158e9`): moving R-b′ before routing is declined for S11-G.**
- D1 recorded, without proposing, the option of moving R-b′ before routing so that it feeds `needs_source_recovery`. That would also remove path 1's R-b′ variant.
- It is declined because it changes R-b′'s semantics, which V1 checked and ROOT selected at 2.1.
- **The R-b′ variant of path 1 stays a disclosed residual under ruling 3.** It was judged narrow at the time. (Corrected 2026-09-27 by the C1 note below: per-case modulus bases are sufficient; they are not shown to be necessary.) (Wording clarified 2026-09-27 on the PR1004 backcheck, B-N1, from "sufficient, not necessary"; the meaning is unchanged.) It fails closed: the captured entry returns `Err` and no envelope. It is characterized by T20. It is owned by the composite `SOURCE_BLOCKS_FINALIZATION_FAILED` item, which closes before T3 closes.
- The finalization item may take the option up, with its own design and check.
- ROOT selects 2.2 on V1's PASS, by the default rule. I5 implements it in its cargo slot, confirming T18 and the T19/T20 multi-basis selection by run.

**Note (ROOT, 2026-09-27, on RV4's interim finding C1 during the PR1003 review): the R-b′ path-1 residual is reachable. Ruling 3 is unchanged.**
- **Construction C1 (RV4):** N05's cantilever with per-case modulus bases. Case A, the cancelling tip torques on the base basis, is Sensitive and selected by recovery. Case B, on a soft basis (E = 1 Pa, G = 0.4 Pa), carries only nodal inputs (tip F_y = 1 N, M_z = 1e-7 N·m).
- **The outcome:** on the captured entry, in both modes, the invocation returns `Err("SOURCE_BLOCKS_FINALIZATION_FAILED")` with no envelope. Case B alone is Passed in its report, and R-b′ demotes it as a true catch (a genuine error of 6.1e-9 relative). With m = 0.5, R-b′ is silent and the invocation returns Ok with a receipt. The typed entry publishes case B as Sensitive.
- **Ruling 3 stands, and moving R-b′ before routing stays declined for S11-G.** C1 uses per-case modulus bases. Single-basis reach through FK's load audit and through K-D5 (V1's N1, the design's E-2) is **not refuted**. The refusal needs a pre-0.4 captured invocation (0.4.0 republishes), a Sensitive source-selected case, and an R-b′ catch on another case. **On that basis the ruling is unchanged:** it fails closed (an `Err` with no envelope; nothing wrong is published), it is confined to the pre-0.4 captured entry, and the finalization item closes it before T3 closes. (Corrected 2026-09-27 on the PR1004 review, S1. The earlier text listed per-case modulus bases as a necessary condition.)
- **Ownership:** the composite `SOURCE_BLOCKS_FINALIZATION_FAILED` item owns it, treats it as **demonstrated** with C1 as its test case, and closes it before T3 closes. Once K-D5 merges, the item re-attempts a single-basis construction through K-D5's per-case formation check.
- **The S11-G repair (tests and records only):** T20 is rebuilt around C1, and the disclosures read "reachable (C1), fail-closed, needs per-case modulus bases and a pre-0.4 captured invocation". RV4 delta-checks that commit. (Corrected 2026-09-27: the accurate wording is "reachable (C1, which uses per-case modulus bases; single-basis reach not refuted), fail-closed, confined to a pre-0.4 captured invocation".)

## Selection: S11-G revision 2.2 (ROOT, 2026-09-27)

**S11G_GUARD revision 2.2 is selected** (`DESIGN_NUMERICS/S11G_GUARD.md`, sha256 `680fecdd…`, commit `3c80158e9`), on V1's delta-2.2 PASS (`REVIEW/S11G_CHECK.md`, sha256 `ec0efce7…`; 1 SHOULD-FIX, 4 NOTE). **D22-1's preferred fix is a binding condition.** 2.2 supersedes 2.1's routing gate. The rest of 2.1 and every earlier S11-G ruling stand.

**What 2.2 does:**
- **G-1:** the routing gate is removed.
- **G-2:** a load-row finding routes like a Sensitive verdict, and `OrdinaryAttempt` records the outcome as sensitive. This is a constructor argument only; V1 confirmed it is not a receipt contract change.
- **G-3:** `decline_formation()`, which V1 found load-bearing in a 0.4.0 subnormal eigen-load corner.

This removes path 2 and path 1's load-row variant. Path 1's R-b′ variant stays under ruling 3.

**1. D22-1 is required, not disclosed.**
- **The problem.** G-2's new attempt on a Passed, guard-fired case charges recovery work up front (SRec:458-472) that neither main nor 2.1 spends. Near the invocation limit, that can cost a later case its selection or refuse the invocation. This is the same class of availability regression ruled out for path 2.
- **The fix I5 implements, per V1's preferred fix:**
  - When main would not attempt the case (report Passed, no `Err`) and the load-row finding is `Some`, record the formation decline **without running the attempt**: a zero-work `RecoveryFailure` plus the same info diagnostic, with existing codes accepted under WORK_LEDGER and FAILURE_CATEGORY.
  - Already-Sensitive guard-fired cases keep the real attempt, so T18's byte-equality with main holds.
- **Required tests:**
  - the invocation budget equals main's on a Passed, guard-fired case;
  - the reader accepts the zero-work entry;
  - a mutation that restores the charged attempt is killed.
- **Records.** D1 adds a short 2.2 erratum (§0.2) with the D22-1 text, and fixes the mislabelled trace check. This is records only and does not block I5 starting on G-1 to G-3. RV4 checks the fix against V1's specification.

**2. The NOTEs:**
- **N1: accepted as information.** The R-b′ residual is reachable through a single basis via FK's load audit (for example an unaudited range row (1e15, −1e15, 1e-300)), and through K-D5 once merged, not only through per-case modulus bases. The residual stays under ruling 3 as recorded. I5 may use the single-basis construction for T19 and T20, which also settles N3 if multi-basis selection does not confirm. The work graph's reach wording is updated to match.
- **N2:** no action.
- **N3:** settled through N1.
- **N4:** T20 is labelled pre-0.4 only. On 0.4.0 the case is republished (CP3 SF-1), not refused; this is recorded.

**3. I5 implements** G-1 to G-3 plus the D22-1 zero-work decline. In its cargo slot it confirms T18, T19 and T20 by run. RV4's basis is 2.2 plus the D22-1 erratum.

**Note on T18–T20 and T6a (ROOT, 2026-09-27, on I5's first runs):**
- **The run evidence.** T18 passes by run in both modes: path 2 is removed, the captured invocation publishes with a receipt, and case B keeps today's integrity bytes. T19 passes by run on a per-case modulus-basis construction: path 1's load-row variant is removed, case B gets the zero-work unsupported entry, and nothing is refused. **T19 settles V1's N3: multi-basis selection works.** T21 and T22 pass.
- **T20: option (a).** I5 could not construct a selected case A beside a case B that R-b′ demotes. It tried three constructions:
  1. A single-basis load-audit row modelled on V1's N1 (V1's row is (1e15, −1e15, 1e-300); I5 used (4e15, −4e15, 1e-300), with PR1002's G = 4e15): recovery refuses case A on the exact radix.
  2. The INPLANE geometry with N05's torsion spring: `UnsupportedBlock { order: 3 }`.
  3. Two disjoint bodies: `UnsupportedBlock { order: 4 }`.
  In each, R-b′ demotes case B without refusal, but no case is selected.
  - T20 is rewritten as a characterization of the actual behaviour: published, no receipt, case B demoted, not refused. A comment names the residual and its owner.
  - RETURN records the three constructions and their outcomes.
  - The residual is disclosed as **"not demonstrated reachable"**. It stays under ruling 3, owned by the composite finalization item, which closes before T3 closes.
  - **Superseded (2026-09-27):** RV4's construction C1 shows the residual is reachable and fails closed. See the C1 note under "S11-G ruling 3, revision 1". T20 is rebuilt around C1, and the disclosure is corrected.
  - **RV4 attempts a construction independently.** If one refuses, RV4 checks that it fails closed (no envelope). It is BLOCKING only if it publishes a value.
  - The work graph notes that K-D5, once merged, may supply a selected case A through its per-case formation check. The finalization item re-attempts the construction then.
- **T6a's pressure run** (the straight-thrust `RoundedProduct` family, refused on fresh solves with `PRESSURE_MODEL_REAUTHOR_REQUIRED`). The manager's direction is upheld: run it through any solve path, including a legacy replay, that reaches the family. Otherwise record the unreachability with file:line evidence, keep a unit-level test of the family's bound, and disclose the deviation for RV4.

## K-D5: the combined-tree gate after S11-G (ROOT, 2026-09-27)

**The pre-S11-G gate passes.** On 3befacff4 plus I3's 8 addendum-4 edits, against the lists at `59fff0d9e`, both entries:
- 888 runs;
- the trusted breach triples are exactly FORMATION_EXCEPTIONS' 7, and none of the former 221 re-breaches;
- RF-SKEW-T-CANT-OFF-122-r1e-04 is the only standing change against P1 (sensitive/needs_recompute on both entries and in both modes).

**After the forward merge of S11-G (main `b24b3d536`),** the combined candidate needs, before RV5:
- the affected suites;
- the T9 fixture diff against main;
- the full both-entry gate against main's **empty** lists, where any trusted breach is a FAIL.

**The ruling: run the full 888, and skip nothing.** It is ordered in two parts, so that RV5 is not held up:
- **Part 1:** every run except the 4 known dense timeouts (RF-LARGE-CHAIN-n01000-ROT and RF-LARGE-TREE-n01000-AX, dense, on both entries). About 50 min. Its result is reported as soon as it finishes.
- **Part 2:** the 4 timeout cases, run immediately after, **with no other cargo on the host.** Contention would bias them toward timing out, which would make the confirmation meaningless. If any of them finishes and publishes, its result is checked against the empty lists like any other run, and a trusted breach is a FAIL.
- **The gate's verdict is the union of both parts,** on the same binary and the same combined head.

**RV5** may be spawned on the combined candidate once part 1, the suites and T9 are green. It reads and traces during part 2, and gets no cargo until part 2 finishes.

Conflict resolution in the forward merge is I3's. Any design question about how K-D5's formation check composes with S11-G's guard (the integrity diagnostic, the no-op rule, routing, D22-1) comes to ROOT.

## K-D5 mutation M31b: equivalence withdrawn (ROOT, 2026-09-27)

**M31b equivalence (`c2042fd9c`) withdrawn on RV5's counterexample, confirmed in Rust. M31b and M31b0 must be killed by a required test before merge.**

- **Why the acceptance was wrong.** It rested on the shift in the maximum-row trigger alone (about 0.002 of the criterion). RV5 showed that the chord error also gives a **first-order** translation error θ·δc at node j on the stiff rows, not only the second-order soft-mode moment. On CSKEW_30_RADIUS_MISMATCH, the row uz at node 1 already carries 0.433 of the criterion from the chord alone. No blame attaches to I3's analysis: it answered the question ROOT asked, which was the wrong question.
- **The confirmation.** RV5 built a `git archive` copy of `2409de83e` (tree `c954590e…`) and ran NI tests with toolchain 1.97.1, against exact references. Admissible models (mismatch ≤ 1e-9, well conditioned) publish Passed with an actual error above the criterion, and the correct check demotes them in both modes:
  - CANT60_PLANAR: actual 1.1019, trigger 2.2037;
  - CANT30_SKEW: actual 1.9005, trigger 3.8010;
  - CANT10_SKEW: actual 6.484;
  - PP_UTM (X 5e6, φ 5°, PP's own centre): actual 1.126;
  - CANT90_PLANAR: actual 0.640, which is condition (b) only.

  **With the M31b patch (and M31b0), none of them demotes, and the published errors are 1.10–6.48 of the criterion.** That is condition (a), a silently wrong Passed value. Near-π admissible models are harmless (actual at most 1.4e-5). The logs are in `REVIEW/_run_records/kd5_review/rust/`.
- **The required tests (ROOT's item 3, final).** They are test-only: the implementation already uses the actual chord (R5-4 §2 step 6).
  - The 60° planar and 30° skew cases, with exact references, on both entries and in both modes. The M31b and M31b0 patches each fail at a behavioural assertion.
  - A product-level demotion test at X 5e6, Y 3.5e6, φ 5°, R 0.3. It publishes SENSITIVE, and the M31b patch makes it publish CHECKS_PASSED.
  - A product-level control at PP_UTM (X 5e5): not demoted, with the published error below half the criterion. The earlier 5e5 figure was an artefact of repr-converted inputs.
- **Records.** K-D5's RETURN §7 and CHANGE_RECORD correct the claim and keep the earlier text marked superseded. **The design claim** — DESIGN.md revision 5a.2 §9 item 31, "build its H from the product's chord … The skew-plane elbow cantilever at k_X = 8.5 (dense) is then missed", with the M31b-equivalence reading of it — **is superseded by this section.** DESIGN.md is hash-pinned by its selection (`fb62ef4a…`), so it is not edited. The chord-only form of mutation 31 is not equivalent, and it is killed by the required tests above.

## F1 split (ROOT, 2026-09-27)

**F1 is split.** The design's §6 places F1 after S11-F, but F1's write set consumes K1 (the kernel sparse assembly) and K2b (formation-time scaling). The kernel order is K2a → K1 → K2b, so F1 as written cannot start yet.
- **F1a starts now** (from main `5ae22926e`, TASK I7): the D-5 evidence line (K-D5's `FormationCheck` rendered as one line in the integrity diagnostic, only when present, composed with S11-G's layout and no-op rule) and SUP-17 (the message text). **SUP-17 committed-byte changes follow the fixture stop rule, and ROOT approves before any regeneration.**
- **F1b waits for K1 and K2b:** the facade sparse wiring and W2 at formation. It is a later TASK, from the F1b part of `TASK_BRIEFS/I7_F1_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
- **The facade path is now:** S11-F ✓ → S11-G ✓ → F1a → (after K1 and K2b) F1b → F2a (with D2's S-G1) → S-I → F2b per domain → F3.

## F1a: D-5 evidence-line format (ROOT, 2026-09-27)

K-D5's `FormationCheck` record, present only when the check demotes, is rendered as **one evidence line** in the integrity diagnostic. The line is modelled on W2's `range_scaling: force_scale_exponent=<b>; basis=exact power-of-two`. The templates, exactly:

- estimate: `formation_check: reason=estimate; row=<node>:<DOF>; doubled_correction=<2|w_i|>; scale=<max(|q_i|,S*)>; trigger_ratio=<2|w_i|/(1e-9*scale)>`
- unavailable: `formation_check: reason=formation_check_unavailable; detail=<detail>`

**Conditions:**
1. **The `reason=` tokens** are exactly K-D5's existing reason identifiers: the string form K-D5 already defines if there is one, otherwise the snake_case of the enum variant. None is invented. Each one is pinned by a test against the enum, so a rename breaks the test.
2. **Field order is fixed** as above. f64 values use `{:?}`, as the Debug report does, including `inf` (the zero-scale clause). `<node>:<DOF>` reuses `integrity_dof_label`, with its `global_dof=<i>` fallback.
3. **Composition:** the line follows S11-G's guard sentence, if there is one, separated by one space, under S11-G's no-op rule. A case with no `FormationCheck` has diagnostics byte-identical to main, and a test proves it.

**Also agreed:**
- A private `formation_check: Option<FormationCheck>` on `PreviewLinearSolve`, plus a parameter to `append_integrity_report`, is acceptable only if it appears in no serialized or published shape. I7 shows that no serde derive or JSON output picks it up; an unchanged committed-fixture diff is the proof.
- Updating the stale comment at K-D5's `tests/formation_check_runtime.rs:88-91` is fine.
- SUP-17 changes no committed bytes (only product_physics `lib.rs`: the message, a comment and the one pinning test; 52 historical `execution/**` records that nothing reads stay as they are). Nothing is regenerated.

## K2a: product reach and the availability trade-off (ROOT, 2026-09-27) — ruling 1 SUPERSEDED

**Superseded in part (2026-09-27):** ruling 1's premise is refuted at product level: main publishes no wrong value through partial underflow. Rulings 2 and 3 stand, and the benefit of the trade-off is restated. See "K2a product reach: correction (ROOT)" below. The text is kept as the record of the earlier ruling.

**I6's finding.** The formation silent zero is **product-reachable on both entries** through material or section values. There is no lower bound on magnitude anywhere on the input path (at `5ae22926e`):
- **Capture** (captured entry only, `core/serialization/canonical_json/src/lib.rs:94-116`, `validate_checked_value`): values must be finite, and integral floats must satisfy |x| ≤ 2^53 − 1. The typed entry has no checked-JSON step.
- **Unit normalization** (`PP lib.rs:7243`): conversion only.
- **Section** (`PP lib.rs:8441-8450`, `derive_pipe_section`): OD and wall must be finite and > 0, with 2·wall < OD.
- **Section properties** (`straight_pipe/src/lib.rs:393-398`): E, G, A, Iy, Iz and J must be positive and finite.
- **Modulus bases** (`PP lib.rs:8241`, `:8259`): E and G must be finite and > 0.
- **The only floor is geometric:** FK `AXIS_TOLERANCE` = 1e-12 m. This is what stops RF-RANGE LEF-small (DegenerateAxis). LEF-large is refused at capture.

**The ruling:**
1. **I6 adds a product-level partial-underflow case.** Main publishes a *wrong* value there (actual error above 1e-9 against an exact or extended-precision reference computed in the test), and K2a refuses it on both entries and in both modes. This case justifies K2a on the product route, and its precondition proves main's value is wrong and by how much. **If no admissible input yields a wrong published value above 1e-9, I6 stops and reports; it does not force one.** **[Superseded by "K2a product reach: correction (ROOT)" below: main publishes no wrong value through partial underflow where M03 applies, and the wrong-value requirement is withdrawn. See also corrections 2 and 3.]**
2. **The spring-carried case stays as a test:** a 2 m member, OD 1e-6 m, wall 1e-7 m, E 2e11 Pa, G 1e-300 Pa. G·J rounds to 0, the spring carries the torque, and main is accurate to 1e-9.
   - **Its refusal is accepted as K2a's intended interim.** The design forms or publishes no zero or subnormal coefficient, and scaling comes with K2b and F1b.
   - CHANGE_RECORD discloses it plainly as **an availability change on admissible but physically absurd inputs, where main's value was accurate.** **[Reworded by "K2a product reach: correction 3 (ROOT)" below: 1/L-lifted zeros, where main's published value was within its K-D5-limited criterion.]**
   - It is recorded on the K2b and F1b list as a case K2b's scaling should restore.
3. **The missing lower magnitude bound on inputs** is a finding for the input-validation owner. It is routed out of T3, not fixed here.

## S11-G performance finding withdrawn; the method for performance claims (ROOT, 2026-09-27)

- **Withdrawn:** the S11-G performance finding (about +15–20% on dense 1000-member solves), recorded from the K-D5 timing comparison. It compared the S11-G-bearing probes against I3's earlier, non-interleaved pre-S11-G gate runs (413/423 s), which had different builds and host conditions.
- **The settling run:** I3R's interleaved comparison of `72d5ff864` against `b24b3d536` on RF-LARGE-CHAIN-n01000-AX and RF-LARGE-TREE-n01000-ROT, dense, with probes built fresh from `git archive`. It shows S11-G's cost within noise: −0.4% (CHAIN-AX) and +0.9% (TREE-ROT), against a same-binary spread of up to 1.8% (`IMPLEMENTATION/S11G_TIMING/`). The item is removed from the T3-close list. `KD5_MERGE/ADDENDUM_1.md` supersedes the statement in the K-D5 merge record.
- **Method (standing):** performance claims come only from **interleaved runs of probes built fresh from archives,** on a quiet host, with load recorded per run. A comparison against an earlier, non-interleaved run is not evidence.

## K2a product reach: correction (ROOT, 2026-09-27) — bound and M03 clauses SUPERSEDED

**Superseded in part (2026-09-27):** the exact-zero statements below (the ~2^-60 bound, and "checks-passed and accurate" as a general claim) are wrong for 6EI/L² and 12EI/L³. So is the benefit clause's "S11-K's M03 already refuses partial underflow". See "K2a product reach: correction 2 (ROOT)" below. The text is kept as the record of the earlier ruling.

**What is refuted.** Ruling 1 of "K2a: product reach and the availability trade-off" (`81dbd95ac`) assumed a product-level partial-underflow case on which main publishes a *wrong* value. ROOT's directive also quoted a 5.9% error and a nonlinear variant published checks-passed. Both are refuted at product level: they came from formation-level arithmetic, not from product output. ROOT adopted the recommendation before a product run existed. I6's stop, under ruling 1's stop clause, was correct.

**I6's product runs on main** (`5ae22926e`, both entries, both modes, linear and nonlinear gap; evidence in `IMPLEMENTATION/K2A/_run_records/product_reach/`):
- **The drafted case** (5.9% coefficient error) is refused as NUMERICAL_INTEGRITY_UNRESOLVED with `Range("product overflow or underflow")`. Its subnormal coefficients trip M03 `checked_product` (FK `structural.rs:377`). The nonlinear loop's iterations also pass through structural integrity.
- **The all-final-coefficients-normal pair** (L = 2^-39 m, the smallest dyadic length above the 1e-12 m axis tolerance; coefficient errors 4.3e-6 and 8.0e-9) is refused as UNRESOLVED with `Range("arithmetic outside normal range")`.
- **The threshold scan** (E scaled by 2^k): main refuses until the smallest coefficient is at least about 2^-972.
- **Exact zeros** pass M03, because zero entries are exempt. This is the spring-carried case: checks-passed and accurate. **[Superseded by "K2a product reach: correction 2 (ROOT)" below.]**

**Rulings on the stop:**
1. **The partial-underflow wrong-value requirement is withdrawn.** The drafted test is kept, restated truthfully: main refuses the case as UNRESOLVED (M03 `Range`) on both variants and in both modes, and K2a refuses it earlier, by name (`NumericalRange`). Its precondition pins main's actual M03 refusal. The L = 2^-39 pair and the threshold scan stay as evidence in `_run_records`.
2. **The availability trade-off stands, with its benefit restated.** K2a proceeds as designed.
   - **Benefit:** K2a corrects no published value on the product route; S11-K's M03 already refuses partial underflow. **[Superseded by "K2a product reach: correction 2 (ROOT)" below: M03 does not refuse partial underflow in general, and main can publish grossly wrong values (untrusted) that K2a refuses.]** Its value is a formation-layer guarantee that does not depend on M03: a named, earlier refusal, and protection for every consumer of `local_stiffness` that does not pass through M03's check. I6 lists those consumers from its caller scan (for example K-D5's re-formation and curved_bend).
   - **Cost:** refusing exact-zero cases on physically absurd inputs, where main's value was accurate. **[Reworded by "K2a product reach: correction 3 (ROOT)" below: 1/L-lifted zeros, where main's published value was within its K-D5-limited criterion.]**
   - **The bound claim** (an exact zero moves a published value by at most about 2^-60 relative) must be derived step by step in K2a's RETURN, not asserted. K2a's reviewer checks it. **[Superseded by "K2a product reach: correction 2 (ROOT)" below.]**
3. **Lesson (standing):** a claim about product behaviour needs a product run. This is the counterpart of the performance lesson: formation-level or adapter-level arithmetic is not evidence of what the product publishes.

## K2a product reach: correction 2 (ROOT, 2026-09-27) — consequence bullets SUPERSEDED

**Superseded in part (2026-09-27):** the 1/L and 1/L² consequence bullets, and the cost clause's wording, are superseded by "K2a product reach: correction 3 (ROOT)" below. The text is kept as the record of the earlier ruling.

**What is superseded.** Two clauses of "K2a product reach: correction" (`bcc84ee06`), each marked in place:
- **Ruling 2's bound clause:** an exact zero moves a published value by at most about 2^-60 relative.
- **Ruling 2's benefit clause:** "S11-K's M03 already refuses partial underflow".

Both are generalizations from a few probes that were never derived. I6 found both errors while deriving the bound for RETURN, and reported each before it was relied on.

**The derivations.** Evidence: `IMPLEMENTATION/K2A/_run_records/product_reach/` (the zero_probe and reach_lef probes, and NOTES.txt). K2a's reviewer checks both in RETURN.
- **Coefficient lifts in `local_stiffness`** (FK `lib.rs:699-747` at `5ae22926e`). Each coefficient is a binary64 product of modulus and section property, divided by a power of L:

  | Coefficient | Numerator (evaluation order) | Lift |
  |---|---|---|
  | axial EA/L | E·A | 1/L |
  | torsion GJ/L | G·J | 1/L |
  | 4EIy/L, 4EIz/L | (4·E)·I | 1/L |
  | 2EIy/L, 2EIz/L | (2·E)·I | 1/L |
  | 6EIy/L², 6EIz/L² | (6·E)·I | 1/L² |
  | 12EIy/L³, 12EIz/L³ | (12·E)·I | 1/L³ |

  With L ≥ 1e-12 m (the FK axis tolerance), a numerator that rounds to 0, or to the least subnormal 2^-1074, has a true value below about 2^-1074. The true coefficient is then at most about 2^-1074/L^k: about 2^-1034 for k = 1, about 2^-994 for k = 2, and about 2^-955 for k = 3.
- **M03's acceptance floor** (FK `structural.rs:1832-1866`, `transform_roundoff`). The roundoff bound per axis-aligned entry c is about 2·gamma(24)·|c|, and `checked_value` refuses a subnormal bound. So M03 refuses when a *nonzero* entry is below about 2^-974.6. **[Scoped to axis-aligned members by K2A/RETURN_ADDENDUM_1; see there.]** Exact zeros are exempt. I6's threshold scan agrees: refused at 2^-981.8, passed at 2^-971.8.
- **Consequence.**
  - **1/L-lifted coefficients** (EA/L, GJ/L, 4EI/L, 2EI/L): a zeroed or wrongly rounded value has a true value of at most about 2^-1034. Against any retained nonzero entry that passes M03 (at least about 2^-974.6), that is a relative effect of at most about 2^-59.4, below the 1e-9 criterion. This is the only place the ~2^-60 figure holds. **[Superseded by "K2a product reach: correction 3 (ROOT)" below: the floor bounds element entries only, not ground springs.]**
  - **1/L²-lifted coefficients** (6EI/L²): the true value is at most about 2^-994, also below the floor. But against the smallest acceptable retained entry, the relative effect can reach about 2^-19.4 (about 1.4e-6), above the criterion. Whether an admissible input realizes that is **not established**. Manager's check: the manager, not I6, noticed this while recording. RETURN must derive it or probe it, and must not assume main is accurate there. **[Superseded by "K2a product reach: correction 3 (ROOT)" below: the floor bounds element entries only, not ground springs.]**
  - **1/L³-lifted coefficients** (12EI/L³): the true value can reach about 2^-955, above the floor. M03 accepts both an exact zero and a normal but grossly wrong value rounded from a least-subnormal numerator (reach_zero and reach_lef below).
  - **M03 does refuse** a partial underflow that leaves a nonzero subnormal-derived coefficient below the floor. **[Scoped to axis-aligned members by K2A/RETURN_ADDENDUM_1; see there.]**

**Cases on main** (`5ae22926e`, both entries, both modes, linear route and open gap; I6, using the main-built harness binary). Both are one member with L = 2^-39 m, OD 1e-11 m, wall 1e-12 m and G = 1e-100 Pa, with UY at N1 the only free DOF. All inputs are normal binary64. **[Evidenced on the captured entry only; the typed entry was not run: K2A/RETURN_ADDENDUM_1 §3.]**
- **reach_zero:**
  - E = 6.4e-280 Pa, so (12·E)·I (about 2.23e-324) rounds to exactly 0. Main's 12EI/L³ is 0 against a true value of about 3.70e-289.
  - A ground spring of 3.7e-289 N/m carries the load, P = 9.25e-290 N.
  - Main publishes u_y = 250 mm against an exact 125.03 mm, 99.95% wrong.
  - I6's message also quoted the spring as 1.85e-289 N/m. That was a slip, which had reached the drafted test constant; I6 has corrected the constant, and RETURN records the reconciliation.
- **reach_lef** (the LEF-small pattern):
  - E = 9.6e-280 Pa, with no spring and P = 2.05e-289 N.
  - (12·E)·I (about 3.34e-324) rounds to the least subnormal, and (6·E)·I, (4·E)·I and (2·E)·I round to 0.
  - Main's 12EIz/L³ is 8.21e-289, normal but 48% high against a true value of 5.55e-289, and its siblings are exactly 0. M03 accepts.
  - Main publishes u_y = 249.72 mm against an exact 369.55 mm, 32.4% wrong.
- **Main's standing** is the same in both cases:
  - linear route: NUMERICAL_INTEGRITY_SENSITIVE in both modes, from K-D5's re-formation; exact-block recovery is unavailable.
  - open gap: unresolved (RECOVERY_BASIS_UNQUALIFIED), because the nonlinear proof hits the exact-radix range.
- **No trusted route was found on main.** On the linear route before K-D5 (`c61a540ea`), main's standing is **not established**. No claim is made either way.
- **Partial underflow that M03 does refuse:** probes A/B and the drafted partial-underflow case, where a nonzero coefficient is subnormal-derived. Main refuses these as UNRESOLVED (M03 `Range`). **[Scoped to axis-aligned members by K2A/RETURN_ADDENDUM_1; see there.]**

**Rulings:**
1. **Adopt a third product test (reach_zero) and a fourth (reach_lef),** each on both entries and in both modes, with the same structure:
   - in-test arithmetic proving the roundings (exactly 0, and the least subnormal with zero siblings);
   - main's actual standing pinned with the wrong published value: Sensitive on the linear route, and unresolved on the gap route. The linear route is pinned at kernel level through K-D5 on main's K. The gap route is pinned at kernel level if a route exists; otherwise the test cites the main harness records, and RETURN says so;
   - a Fraction reference, with expected values computed from the actual inputs;
   - K2a's refusal by name.
2. **RETURN derives, step by step:** every coefficient with its lift (the table above), the M03 floor at about 2^-974.6, and for each coefficient which zeros or roundings main bounds and which it does not.
3. **The benefit, restated:**
   - M03 refuses partial underflow **only when a nonzero coefficient is subnormal-derived** (below about 2^-974.6). **[Scoped to axis-aligned members by K2A/RETURN_ADDENDUM_1; see there.]**
   - Where a 12EI/L³ numerator rounds to exactly 0, or to the least subnormal with its siblings exactly 0 (the LEF pattern), M03 accepts. Main then publishes a grossly wrong value (99.95% in reach_zero, 32.4% in reach_lef), flagged only downstream: Sensitive through K-D5, or unresolved through the nonlinear proof. **[On skew members M03 also accepts other patterns (subnormal-derived 4EI/L and 2EI/L below the floor): K2A/RETURN_ADDENDUM_1; see there.]**
   - K2a refuses all of these at formation, by name, independent of M03, of K-D5 and of the nonlinear proof.
   - K2a also refuses a zero in 6EI/L², where main's accuracy is not established (see the consequence above).
   - **The cost is unchanged:** exact zeros in the 1/L-lifted coefficients (for example the spring-carried GJ/L case), where main was accurate, are now refused. **[Reworded by "K2a product reach: correction 3 (ROOT)" below.]**
4. **A new T3-close item.** K2a covers `local_stiffness` only. Check whether curved-element formation (curved_bend and arc_model), and any other stiffness-forming path, can produce the same unbounded zero or wrong rounding from terms scaled by 1/L² or 1/L³. I6 lists the paths from its caller scan. The item is outside K2a's scope; if reachable, route it to K5 or to its own slice.
5. **Lesson (standing), added to the product-run lesson:** a bound or general claim inferred from a few probes must be **derived**, and the derivation checked by someone other than its author, before a ruling rests on it. ROOT ruled twice on underived generalizations (the ~2^-60 bound, and M03 refusing partial underflow). There is no blame to I6, who found both errors.

## K2a product reach: correction 3 (ROOT, 2026-09-27)

**What is superseded.** Correction 2's 1/L and 1/L² consequence bullets (each marked in place). They bounded a zero's relative effect against "any retained nonzero entry that passes M03". But M03's floor comes from `transform_roundoff` and applies to **element entries only**. **[Per-entry only for axis-aligned members; on skew members the transformed bounds mix coefficients: K2A/RETURN_ADDENDUM_1.]** Ground springs added to K are not subject to it, and main accepts springs far below the floor. So neither bullet states a bound, and the "~2^-60 holds for 1/L" sentence is withdrawn. The premise was the **manager's**, added while recording correction 2, and falls under lesson 5. I6 found it while probing the 6EI/L² item.

**Rulings:**
1. **What limits trusted publication.** On the linear route it is K-D5's re-formation trigger: an **estimate-based** demotion, not a proved bound on the true error. I6's probes reach_six2 and reach_gj (`IMPLEMENTATION/K2A/_run_records/product_reach/`, NOTES items 6 and 7) are consistent with it: runs published checks-passed stayed within the criterion, and larger errors were demoted to Sensitive. The nonlinear route ended unresolved in every probe. Pre-K-D5 behaviour is not claimed.
2. **No fifth test.** The 6EI/L² item produced no admissible case in which main publishes a trusted value wrong beyond the criterion.
3. **The cost clause, reworded:** K2a refuses 1/L-lifted zeros where main's published value was within its K-D5-limited criterion (for example the spring-carried GJ/L case).
4. **Process: rulings stop restating numeric bounds on this topic.** The authoritative statement of K2a's product reach is the derivation section of I6's K2a RETURN, checked by K2a's independent reviewer. Rulings and the work graph cite it by section and do not restate its figures. Where the figures in corrections 1 and 2 differ from that section, the RETURN section governs.

## K1: spawn timing and no both-entry gate (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

- **Spawn.** K1 (I8) is spawned now, not when K2a's PR opens, because the write sets are disjoint. K2a writes `FK/lib.rs`, `diagnostics` and new tests. K1 writes `FK/structural.rs`, new `FK/structural/sparse.rs`, `sparse_direct` and `structural_adapter.rs`. The worktree is `<wt>/k1`, on branch `codex/piping-k1-20260928` from main `134eefc24`, with target `<wt>/k1-target`.
- **The brief's conditions stand** (`TASK_BRIEFS/I8_K1_IMPLEMENTATION.md`):
  1. K1 does not edit `FK/lib.rs`. If it would need to, it stops, and K1 moves to after K2a's merge.
  2. K1's PR cannot merge before K2a's.
- **K2a-interaction tests.** I8 drafts them read-only against K2a's branch, and lands them after K2a merges and main is merged into K1's branch.
- **No both-entry gate for K1.** K1 is kernel only and changes no published byte. The evidence is the parity tests and T9 (the committed-fixture diff). The gate runs at F1b, when `PP` switches to the sparse representation.
- **Host.** One heavy job at a time. I6 prunes between phases. I8 builds only named crates in its slot. Before deleting anything hash-cited to free disk, ask ROOT.

## K1: the S11 site table for sparse.rs and formation_check.rs (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

- **Issue.** `frame_kernel/tests/s11_site_table.rs` (S11 §4.3 rule 7, R3-3) scans only its fixed SOURCES list. K1's new `FK/structural/sparse.rs` would carry accumulation sites the table cannot see. K-D5's `FK/structural/formation_check.rs` is not in SOURCES either; the T3 manager found this while ruling on K1.
- **sparse.rs: option (a) endorsed.** K1 adds sparse.rs to SOURCES as a declared, additive write-set extension, under five conditions:
  1. no existing row, count or disposition changes;
  2. each sparse.rs site has a disposition under S11 §2.5. Stiffness-side sites are explicit exemptions with reasons, and any load, force or RHS accumulation goes through `ExactAccumulator` (count 0);
  3. a binary64-fold mutant in sparse.rs is killed by the table;
  4. the extension is declared in CHANGE_RECORD and RETURN;
  5. a site that fits no existing disposition stops the work, and I8 reports it.
- **formation_check.rs rides K1's PR as a separate commit,** in the same test file.
  - It adds per-function rows and dispositions, with no change to existing rows. Stiffness and re-formation sites are explicit exemptions, with reasons.
  - A binary64-fold mutant in formation_check.rs must be killed by the table.
  - **If any formation_check.rs site is a load, force or RHS accumulation in plain binary64** (a real rule-7 violation, not a table gap), I8 stops and reports it as a K-D5 finding before touching anything. That would be product code, not a table edit.
  - It is declared in K1's CHANGE_RECORD and RETURN as a separate item. K1's reviewer covers both commits.

## K1: extending the K-D5 and option-(c) source pins for the sparse siblings (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

- **Issue (I8).** K1's brief requires pattern-taking `SA` entries beside the existing ones, plain and with the formation check, and also that existing suites stay unchanged. Two text pins in `nonlinear_integration/src/s11k_tests.rs` encode "exactly one definition":
  - `kd5_nonlinear_sources_name_no_formation_check_entry_point`: one definition of the formation-checked entry, with its plumbing tokens only in that body;
  - `option_c_structural_adapter_legacy_variants_reach_only_binary64_entry_points`: it blanks only the first definition of each listed signature, then forbids exact-entry tokens elsewhere.

  The sparse siblings in `SparseAssemblyEvidence` are second definitions, so they trip both pins. `StructuralSystem::assembled(` also matches inside `SparseStructuralSystem::assembled(`. The invariant the pins protect still holds: the nonlinear loop and the legacy binary64 variants reach no exact or formation-check entry. I8 declined to rename or move code to evade the scans.
- **Approved, in the manager's tightened form.** The edits to `s11k_tests.rs` are additive:
  - blanking and definition counts are scoped by impl block: `AssemblyEvidence`'s originals as today, plus `SparseAssemblyEvidence`'s named siblings only, with exactly one definition of the formation-checked entry in each;
  - tokens match on identifier boundaries;
  - `solve_binary64` and `solve_structural_sparse_binary64` stay checked as today;
  - zero crate calls of the new siblings, and exactly one product call (PP's `solve_preview_reduced_system`) until F1b;
  - **required:** a behavioural pin that the loop reaches neither the dense nor the pattern formation entry;
  - **required mutants, each killed:** an exact-entry call inside `solve_binary64`; a loop call to the pattern formation entry; a third definition in a new impl.
- **No weakening, proved.** The mutants the original pins were written against are re-run, and each must still be killed by the extended pins at a named assertion. These are K-D5's E4 patch (and E1–E3 where they touch these pins), and the option-(c) mutants recorded in S11-K's and K-D5's records. They are listed with their kill sites in K1's RETURN.
- It is declared in K1's CHANGE_RECORD and RETURN as a pin extension. K1's independent reviewer checks it against the pins' original intent.
- **Rejected:** dropping the pattern formation entry from K1. The F1b interface stays.

## K1: the S11-F site test's KERNEL list, and the handoff (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

- **sparse.rs in `product_physics/tests/s11f_site_test.rs`'s KERNEL list: approved,** under the site-table conditions. The addition is additive only, a mutant in sparse.rs is killed by the test, and it is declared as a write-set extension into product_physics **tests only**. It lands as its own hunk.
- **The C3-detect helper** I8 removed from `sparse_direct`: if it was pre-existing code, it is restored and routed to ROOT. If it was I8's own draft, no action is needed. `IMPLEMENTATION/K1/WIP_STATE.md` records which.
- **Handoff.** K1 moves to a local session on the owner's Mac (`HANDOFF_2026-09-28_TO_LOCAL.md`). I8 ran no cargo, and its work is committed as one WIP commit, "K1 WIP (handoff; not reviewed)", on `codex/piping-k1-20260928`. K2a finishes in the cloud session.

## K2a dispositions and the axis-aligned pointer pass (ROOT, 2026-09-28; RV9's N1)

These happened before this entry existed, and are recorded here so that the V1 record is complete.
- **RV7's findings on K2a** (B1, S1–S3 and N1–N5) were answered by K2a's records-only `RETURN_ADDENDUM_1`. N2 was closed by per-site rows. The dispositions and the E2E and sweep standing for `aad23e82d` are in `IMPLEMENTATION/K2A_MERGE/RECORD.md`, "Gates".
- **The bracketed axis-aligned pointers** in corrections 1–3 above were added in `435a26971`, as K2A_REVIEW §8.3 asked. They follow correction 3, ruling 4: cite the RETURN section, and don't restate figures.

## The skew M03 pin: a tests-only follow-up before K2b (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

- **The routing.** K2a's merge record routed the pin to K1's pattern-path M03 tests, with K5 as the fallback. K1 merged without it (ROOT's miss; `K1_MERGE/RECORD.md`).
- **Pinning it now** costs little, and fixes M03's skew scope before K2b and F1b lean on M03. So it becomes its own tests-only slice, run by **I9** (`TASK_BRIEFS/I9_M03_SKEW_PIN.md`).
- **The product evidence:** a better-conditioned skew model (G comparable to E), run on pre-K2a main `134eefc24` and on current main. If pre-K2a main published a trusted wrong value, that is a stop, and it would change K2a's product-reach statement.
- **Gates:** those of a slice PR, with DEC-025 under the owner's Mac decision (`OWNER_DIRECTION.md`, 2026-09-28).

## K2b: kernel only, and the LEF expectation restated (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

- **Kernel only, like K1.**
  - K2b adds W2's scaled evidence, the b-rule and formation-time scaling (SCALE-W) as kernel entries and options. Existing entries keep today's behaviour byte for byte at b = 0.
  - PP's wiring and the `range_scaling:` evidence line are F1b's.
  - So K2b changes no published byte, and **runs no both-entry gate**. The parity tests and T9 are the evidence; the gate runs at F1b.
  - If the design cannot be met without changing an existing entry's behaviour, I10 stops and reports.
- **The LEF expectation, for the kernel half** (resolving part of `I7_F1_IMPLEMENTATION.md` addendum 1):
  - RF-RANGE **LEF-small never reaches formation.** `FrameElement::new` refuses it with `DegenerateAxis` at the 1e-12 m axis tolerance (verified by K1's K2a-interaction tests). The design's "LEF-small solved" is therefore unreachable and is withdrawn for K2b.
  - K2b must instead solve, at kernel level through scaled formation and each accurate to 1e-9 against an exact reference:
    - **LEF-large**, which reaches `local_stiffness` on the typed entry;
    - **K2a's formation-range cases with normal geometry**: reach_zero, reach_lef, the spring-carried G = 1e-300 case (recorded for K2b's scaling to restore), and the partial-underflow case. **[Restated by "K2b: rulings on I10's checkpoint-A stop (ROOT)" below, rulings A and C.]**
  - F1b's brief restates the product level separately before F1b spawns.
- **A plan before code:** I10 returns a plan at checkpoint 0 for ROOT's approval (`TASK_BRIEFS/I10_K2B_IMPLEMENTATION.md`).

## K2b: rulings on I10's checkpoint-0 plan (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

I10 read the design, the rulings and the code at `eb52114e9`, and asked for seven decisions before writing code.

1. **The parity of b: even b (E1). This amends the letter of §4.7 step 3, not its intent.**
   - **The finding.** The gate prepares the system with power-of-two diagonal scaling. With K' = 2^b·K and f' = 2^b·f:
     - for **even** b, the scale exponents shift by b/2 and the prepared matrix is bit-identical. So pivots, rcond, the screens, refinement, the audits and K-D5's EF are invariant, and u is bit-identical.
     - for **odd** b, factors of √2 enter the prepared matrix. Dense Cholesky's u then differs in its last bits, and rcond can flip the √ε Sensitive screen.
   - **Why the design's letter fails.** §4.7's promises ("every scaling is exact"; "displacements are unchanged"; "every M03 screen is componentwise-relative, so the scaled evidence is equivalent") hold only for even b. The floored midpoint of step 3 can be odd.
   - **The rule:**
     - let m = ⌊(b_lo + b_hi)/2⌋, floored toward −∞;
     - b = m if m is even;
     - otherwise m − 1 if that is ≥ b_lo;
     - otherwise m + 1 if that is ≤ b_hi;
     - if the window is a single odd point, refuse with the window reason.
   - **Conditions** (standing lesson: a bound or general claim must be derived and independently checked):
     - I10 writes the invariance derivation step by step in RETURN;
     - K2b's independent reviewer checks it;
     - tests pin it: forced even b gives a bitwise-equal u and an exactly unscaled report on normal models, in both representations and both modes;
     - an "odd midpoint" mutant must be killed.
   - `DESIGN.md` is hash-pinned and is not edited; this ruling supersedes step 3's midpoint for parity only.
2. **The census scope: approved as proposed (F2).**
   - Frames contribute:
     - the exponents of E and G;
     - the **predicted** exponent (the sum of operand exponents) of every intermediate and coefficient that K2a checks and that scales with b: E·A, G·J, k·E, (k·E)·I, and the 10 coefficients.
   - Users, springs, curved block entries and load terms contribute exact exponents.
   - Any subnormal census input is refused as "range: subnormal stiffness or load at formation", per step 2: its bits were lost before the kernel. This includes a frame operand (E, G, A, Iy, Iz, J, L).
   - The census runs only after step 1 fails with a range trigger, so no case solved at b = 0 changes.
   - Coefficients alone would admit b values that K2a's scaled intermediates still refuse (I10's L = 2^-39 example), so the intermediates stay in.
3. **The publication rule: the design's list only (F3).** **[Amended for residual records by "K2b: rulings on I10's checkpoint-A stop (ROOT)" below, ruling B.]**
   - Step 5's outcomes apply to the published **actions, reactions and residual records**, meaning the physical fields of residual and intended rows. For these:
     - normal is exact;
     - subnormal is published with its stated precision;
     - nonzero underflow or overflow makes the case NUMERICAL_INTEGRITY_UNRESOLVED ("range: publication outside binary64"), never flushed.
   - Other force-unit diagnostic fields, such as `contribution_rounding`, are unscaled with the same single-rounding function and published descriptively, as at b = 0. They never make a case unresolved. RETURN lists every field and its treatment.
4. **The load-ledger scaling: L1 approved as a declared write-set extension** (`AssembledForce::force_scaled(&self, b)` in `FK/load_ledger.rs`, one method).
   - Terms are scaled exactly: a Product scales one factor, or splits b across both, whichever stays normal.
   - Each net is re-rounded once at scale.
   - Nothing is pushed to a ledger.
   - The dropped S11-G records are shown by test or scan to be unread by the kernel.
   - It is declared in CHANGE_RECORD and RETURN.
5. **The pins and site tests: approved as declared, additive extensions** on K1's precedent.
   - The files are NI `s11k_tests.rs`, FK `s11_site_table.rs`, and PP `s11f_site_test.rs` (tests only).
   - No existing row, count or disposition changes.
   - The required mutants are each killed: a loop call to a scaled entry, plumbing outside the sibling, and a third definition.
   - The original pins' mutants are re-run, with their kill sites in RETURN. **One that is no longer killed stops the work.**
6. **The SA orchestrator `solve_with_force_scaling`: yes.**
   - It makes steps 1–5 testable at kernel level, and gives F1b one entry.
   - It must have zero product calls until F1b, pinned like K1's siblings.
7. **The refusal types: approved.**
   - New result and error types. There are **no new variants** in `StructuralError` or `FrameKernelError`, so PP's and diagnostics' exhaustive matches are untouched.
   - Refusals keep the step-1 trigger, so K2a's names survive where no feasible b exists.
   - The window text renders §4.7 step 3's template with integer exponents.

**Also recorded for F1b's list (I10's note):** loads that PP forms at b = 0 from out-of-range products (for example a thermal E·A·α·ΔT) have lost bits before the kernel, and the kernel cannot restore a term that underflowed to zero. F1b must form such loads under the chosen b, or refuse them.

## K3: spawn and rulings (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

- **K3 is spawned** as I11, in parallel with K2b (I10), because their write sets are disjoint (`TASK_BRIEFS/I11_K3_IMPLEMENTATION.md`). A TASK drafted the brief, and ROOT reviewed it and ruled on its questions. The rulings are in the brief, under "ROOT rulings for this slice".
- **The key scope finding.** `Wide<2>` is on the product path through K-D5, carrying the D-5 evidence line's EF values and `WideError`'s `Display`. So K3 builds its new widths **beside** `Wide<2>`, and a change to any existing `Wide<2>` result, `Debug` token or `Display` string stops the work.
- **Evidence and gates.** K3 adds no product caller, so the evidence is T9 at 112 of 112 (Mac-only), K-D5's suites unchanged, and a `Display` pin. **The both-entry gate is not run.**
- **K4's needs.** K4 cannot edit `wide.rs`, so K3 also supplies K4's arithmetic: widening and narrowing, TwoSum and TwoProduct, an exact-integer constructor, and per-width work counts. K4 adds the `exact_sum.rs` accessor.

## K2b: rulings on I10's checkpoint-A stop (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

I10 stopped at checkpoint A under ruling 1's stop clause. Two of the four restated product-reach cases were not solved. The evidence is `k2b_checkpoint_a_finding_spring_carried_and_partial_underflow_are_refused`, on `codex/piping-k2b-20260928` at `6ce4d694b`.

**A. Spring-carried (G = 1e-300 Pa): it stays a named refusal. This restates the K2b LEF ruling's second bullet for this case.**
- **The finding.** At the rule's b, formation passes K2a, but M03's contribution audit (`audit_contributions`) refuses the solve with `Range("exact radix loses represented bits")`.
  - GJ/L is about 2^-1082 times the spring it is absorbed into. The audit's measure of that absorbed difference lies below binary64 in the equilibrated units.
  - Force scaling preserves every ratio, so no b changes this. The limit is M03's audit, not formation range.
- **The ruling.** K2b does not change the audit. Changing it would change b = 0 behaviour, which is outside K2b's scope and needs its own design ruling.
  - The case remains refused, with K2a's name `GJ/L: G*J` kept as the trigger, so availability is as under K2a.
  - K2a ruling 2's note that the case was "recorded for K2b's scaling to restore" is answered: **force scaling cannot restore it.**
- **Routed:** W1 (K4 and F2a), whose 64-bit exponent may reach it, is to evaluate it. The case goes on K4's list.

**B. Partial underflow: residual records are published descriptively, with an explicit outcome. This amends checkpoint-0 ruling 3.**
- **The finding.** At b = 898 the solve is accurate to within 1e-9. But one intended-action residual record's physical field (about 2^-1076.5) underflows when unscaled, and ruling 3 refused the case over that record.
- **Why refusing is wrong.**
  - At b = 0 the kernel already publishes these physical fields descriptively, including subnormal or zero values.
  - The gate's basis is the normalized fields and the integer exponents, and those unscale exactly under even b.
  - Refusing an accurate result over a diagnostic record would be stricter than b = 0.
- **The ruling:**
  - step 5's refusal ("range: publication outside binary64") applies to published **actions and reactions**;
  - the physical fields of residual and intended-action rows are unscaled with the same single rounding and **carry an explicit representability outcome**: normal, subnormal with its precision, or underflow or overflow, never a silent zero;
  - they never make a case unresolved.
- This departs from the letter of §4.7 step 5, which lists residual records. The design's intent ("never flushed") is kept, because the outcome is explicit. RETURN states the departure and K2b's reviewer checks it.

**C. LEF-large: the accuracy clause, restated.**
- LEF-large solves **bit-identically to its RF base case, times exact powers of two**, with the base case's standing:
  - CONT is Passed and within 1e-9;
  - CHAIN and SKEW are Sensitive, as their bases are today: flagged, not claimed accurate.
- K2b adds no accuracy beyond the ordinary path. W1 is the route to accuracy on those bases.
- reach_zero, reach_lef, PHYS-R4 (b = 536, against the design's "≈ 500") and partial underflow (under B) are solved and accurate, as required.

## K3: rulings on I11's checkpoint-0 plan (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

I11's plan keeps K3a's `Wide<2>` code untouched. `wide.rs` gains one module line, a doc pointer, one appended `WideError` variant (`OperandPrecision`) with its `Display` arm, and the allowance relabels. All new arithmetic goes in a child module. The rulings on its eight open positions:

1. **Approved: the child module `retained/wide/multi.rs`,** under brief ruling 10. Its test module is declared from `multi.rs` and pointed at `FK/tests/retained_wide_k3/k3_tests.rs`. It stays a unit-test module in FK's own suite, and so in CI. Both are declared in CHANGE_RECORD.
2. **Dead-code labels must name the real consumer.** This amends the brief's blanket "K4 API".
   - Each allowance names the slice that will actually call the item.
   - K4 runs at L ≥ 4, so K3a's `Wide<2>`-only items get no K4 caller:
     - `atan_positive` is labelled "later-slice API (W1c; K3 Q6)";
     - `Wide<2>` accessors with no known consumer are labelled "K3a API, no caller yet (reviewed at T3 close)".
   - The T3-close list gains that review.
3. **Approved:** `from_integer` of a zero magnitude returns +0 whatever the sign flag, following D1 §4.1.2 ("an exact zero is +0.0").
4. **Approved:** the accumulator cross-check allows one more difference. The conversion gives `Normal(−0.0)` for an exact −0 (the Q5 convention); the accumulator never returns −0.0.
5. **Approved:** the literal §7.3-13 and §7.3-16 analogues are kept where they are lossy (at low p), and a scaled variant, whose small term is about 2^-(p+16) of the large one, is added at every p. The fold must lose that small term.
6. **Approved:** about 5 MB of test data, with the brief's 1,000 sample records per stream kept. The digests cover every record.
7. **Q7 stays open until checkpoint A,** when ROOT rules on the measured debug wall times. The bit-serial ÷ and √ (64L + 2 bits, K3a's small-trust-base choice) are approved. Knuth's algorithm D is left to a later optimization with its own vectors.
8. **For K4's brief:** the new core exists at L = 2 only in tests, so K4's p = 128 and 192 run at L = 4 (together with Q8's ceiling question).

## K2a product reach: main's skew standing is now established (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

K2a's `RETURN_ADDENDUM_1` §1.3 left open whether pre-K2a main refuses skew cases downstream in general. I9's product runs answer it, and RV10 reproduced them byte for byte (`IMPLEMENTATION/M03_SKEW_PIN/RETURN.md` §6; `REVIEW/M03_SKEW_PIN_REVIEW.md`). As correction 3, ruling 4 requires, the figures stay in those sections and are not restated here.
- **Pre-K2a main (`134eefc24`) published no trusted value** on the probed skew cases: no checks_passed or numerically_eligible result.
- **It did publish skew cases as Sensitive (untrusted)** at intermediate G/E, some wrong beyond the criterion. So refusal downstream is **not general**: main flagged these cases and did not refuse them. This matches correction 3's statement that K-D5's estimate-based demotion is what limits trusted publication.
- **Current main refuses every probed case at formation, by name** (K2a).
- **The claim "6EI/L² is the limiting coefficient" holds only in RV7's configuration.** RV10's S2 and the scoped §3.4 give the counterexamples. Among them is the torsion analogue of B1 (a subnormal-derived GJ/L), which K2a's `GJ/L: G*J` refusal covers on current main.
- **Added to the T3-close list:** M03's element-entry floor is an axis-aligned argument, and its skew scope in general is a documented limitation. The skew M03 pin (PR #1038) guards it in RV7's configuration only. The item asks whether M03's bound should be made orientation-robust, or whether formation-time checks (K2a) and W1 are the accepted defence. ROOT decides at T3 close.

## K3: Q7, the differential's debug cost (ROOT, 2026-09-28) — SUPERSEDED

**Superseded (2026-09-28)** by "K3: Q7 reversed — the test profile is withdrawn (ROOT)" below. Its premise, that results cannot change with optimization level, is false for `powi` over compile-time constants. The text is kept as the record of the earlier ruling.

- **The measurement.** I11's checkpoint A was taken on the Mac, as observations and not a performance claim. With K3's 10^6-operation streams per precision (the §4.11 minimum), FK's full debug test suite takes about 232 s, against about 6 s before. The L = 16 streams dominate: the bit-serial ÷ and √ over 1,026 steps. Hosted CI runners are slower, and the numerical job has a 45-minute budget across all 39 manifests.
- **The ruling:** add a `[profile.test]` section to `FK/Cargo.toml` as a declared K3 change, and keep every stream at full count in the default suite. §7.4's placement is kept, with no `#[ignore]` and no reduced count.
  - Use the smallest `opt-level` (1, else 2) that brings FK's suite to about a minute on the Mac.
  - Set `debug-assertions = true` and `overflow-checks = true` explicitly, so that test semantics do not change.
  - There is no lockfile change.
- **Why the results cannot change.** Rust gives IEEE-754 binary64 semantics at every optimization level: no fast-math, no reassociation, and no FMA contraction by default. The K3 arithmetic is integer-only. FK's own bit-exact tests (K3a's vectors, the K1 parity, K-D5's and K2a's pins) prove the claim on this tree.
- **Conditions, checked at B:**
  - FK's full suite passes with the same test list under the new profile;
  - K3a's and K-D5's pins are unchanged;
  - the measured wall times at each opt-level tried are recorded;
  - hosted CI's numerical job time on K3's PR is recorded in the merge record.
- The design's §7.4 placement stands. K3's reviewer checks the profile change.

## K2b: the b-rule's window misses the solve's range; "no third attempt" is not equivalent (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

- **ROOT's framing was wrong.** At checkpoint C, ROOT asked I10 to record the "third attempt" mutant as "equivalent by construction, pending the reviewer's check". I10 derived three mechanisms that do make a refusal persist across the window: formation (census margins), ratio invariance (audit-limited cases), and subnormal-u persistence. It then **disproved** the general claim.
  - The gate's equilibrated right-hand side, the triangular-solve intermediates and y scale by 2^(b/2). They are neither b-invariant nor covered by the census, and the midpoint rule does not centre them.
  - **The counterexample** (a scratch probe on `8e6698282`; `IMPLEMENTATION/K2B/_run_records/retry_probe/`): an axial chain with E = 2^440, and UX loads of 2^-1010 N and 1 N.
    - The rule chooses b = 312 and refuses the case ("range: scaled evaluation outside normal range").
    - Forced b = 500 and 572 give Passed, within 1e-9 of the exact reference.
  - Its reach needs a load about 1,450 binary orders below the stiffness in the same row, so realistic reach is nil. It fails safe: a named refusal, and nothing wrong is published.
  - The standing lesson applied. The derivation was required rather than assumed, and it found the error before any ruling rested on it.
- **Rulings:**
  1. **K2b keeps §4.7 step 4 as designed:** one scaled evaluation, and no third attempt.
  2. **Pin the case with a test** (tests only, added after checkpoint C), labelled a **documented limitation of the b-rule, not desired behaviour**, citing this section. It asserts:
     - the named refusal at the rule's b, in both modes and both representations;
     - that a forced b in the window solves it within 1e-9.

     The "third attempt" mutant (a retry within the window) must then be killed behaviourally. RETURN §13.3 and the mutation table are updated.
  3. **A design finding, on the T3-close list:** the b-rule's census omits the solve's right-hand-side and intermediate range. Candidate refinements are a per-row load-to-stiffness term in the census, or a bounded, deterministic retry. **F1b's brief must consider it** before F1b wires b into the product. No refinement lands in K2b.
- **The even-b derivation's premise** (RETURN §4) is also recorded: every rounded operation is zero or normal at both scales. The dense Cholesky factor and the triangular solves have no range checks, so the kernel does not enforce the premise. **[Corrected by "K2b: rulings on RV11's review" below (RV11-3): the dense Cholesky, the triangular solves and the skyline LDLᵀ are range-checked at the head. What was unchecked is the reaction and member-action arithmetic, and the rounding boundary into the normal range.]** The forced-b tests pin its consequences. K2b's reviewer checks the derivation and states whether the premise's scope is adequately disclosed.

## K3: Q7 reversed — the test profile is withdrawn (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

- **What happened.** ROOT merged main (with the skew M03 pin) into K3 and ran FK's suite under K3's `[profile.test] opt-level = 1`. One test failed: `m03_skew_scope.rs::m03_skew_pin_rv7_cases_outcomes_and_figures` (2EI/L's exact error came out 1.1364e-13 against the pinned 1.1378e-13).
  - The test computes the pipe's second moment from compile-time constants with `od.powi(4)`.
  - At opt-level ≥ 1, LLVM constant-folds `powi` through the host's `pow`. At opt-level 0 it calls the runtime repeated multiplication. The two differ by an ulp, and the pinned figure moved.
- **ROOT's premise was false.** The Q7 ruling said "Rust gives IEEE-754 binary64 semantics at every optimization level … so the results cannot change". That holds for + − × ÷ √. It does **not** hold for functions of unspecified precision, such as `powi`, when the compiler evaluates them at compile time.
  - ROOT asserted the claim without deriving or checking it: a breach of the standing lesson on general claims. The skew pin, which was written and reviewed at opt-level 0, caught it.
  - **The product is not affected.** Its `powi` inputs are runtime data, and T9's release-built outputs have always matched the debug-built tests.
- **The measurement that settles it.** Hosted CI's whole "Numerical cargo suite" job (all 39 manifests) takes about 4–5.5 minutes on current main (runs 36380608240 and 36391476996), against its 45-minute budget. K3's full-count streams at opt-level 0 fit easily. The profile was never needed for CI, and it adds a class of opt-level-dependent test behaviour that FK alone would carry.
- **The ruling:**
  1. **K3 reverts the `[profile.test]` section** in `FK/Cargo.toml`. FK's tests build at opt-level 0, like every other crate's.
  2. **Every stream stays at full count** in the default suite (§4.11, §7.4).
  3. **The P1/P2 guard test stays.** It still asserts that overflow checks and debug assertions are on in FK's test build.
  4. **The evidence is re-run at opt-level 0 on the merged tree:**
     - FK's full suite, including the skew pin's tests;
     - the full mutation table, with the NONE control first;
     - the measured debug wall time.
  5. **Hosted CI's numerical-job time** on K3's PR goes in the merge record.
- **A lesson, recorded:** a test must not depend on how the compiler evaluates a function of unspecified precision. Tests that need exact section properties should compute them with explicit, ordered arithmetic on runtime values, or on `black_box`ed constants. This is a T3-close note on test hygiene.

## K2b: rulings on RV11's review (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

RV11 reviewed PR #1040 at `087b3a088`: **FAIL**, with 1 BLOCKING, 3 SHOULD-FIX and 7 NOTE findings (`REVIEW/K2B_REVIEW.md`). Its checks of the kernel-only claim (a lexer scan, and the b = 0 probe re-run at 439/439), the 13-step even-b derivation, the census and the pin, and ruling B all hold. The rulings:

1. **RV11-1 (BLOCKING): reactions and member actions at scale must never publish a wrong value labelled Normal.**
   - `SparseStiffness::force_scaled_reactions` forms K′·u at 2^b with the unchecked binary64 `multiply`, then unscales. RV11's probe F-A2 publishes reactions of 0, labelled Normal, where today's E12 gives ±1.38e-300 N.
   - **Fix, fail-closed:** every product and partial sum of the reaction at scale is checked. A value that leaves the normal range (and is not an exact zero) refuses the reaction with the step-5 refusal. It is never published as Normal. An exact alternative (an `ExactAccumulator` sum of exact products) is acceptable if the implementer prefers it and pins it the same way.
   - **K2b also provides F1b a kernel function for member actions at scale, built the same way,** and RETURN §15's recipe points to it. The recipe must no longer publish end shears through unchecked arithmetic.
   - **Tests:** F-A2 and its 2^80-larger variant must be refused, or be correct with a normal outcome. They must never be a wrong Normal. Add a mutant that restores the unchecked multiply; it must be killed.
2. **RV11-2 (SHOULD-FIX, fixed in K2b):** `exact_normal_scaling` must refuse a result that is normal only because it rounded up from the subnormal range: the scaled value must be exact. Add a test, and a mutant.
3. **RV11-3 (SHOULD-FIX, records):** RETURN §4's premise disclosure and §6's "exact sum of K′·u" are corrected to what the code does. ROOT's own sentence at `97000ab9f` is corrected in place above.
4. **RV11-4 (SHOULD-FIX, tests):** tests pin the census scope so that both surviving mutants are killed: `Product` recorded at e(x) alone, and curved slots left out of the census. Their effect is availability only, but ruling 2 defines the scope and a test must hold it.
5. **Process:**
   - I10 fixes these on the K2b branch;
   - it re-runs the affected evidence: the targeted tests, the suites against the Mac baseline, the b = 0 probe, T9, and the mutation table's affected rows plus the new mutants;
   - it adds a RETURN addendum;
   - RV11 then delta-checks the fix commits.
   - DEC-025 is re-run on the new head on a quieter host. At `087b3a088`, `App.test.tsx`'s workspace render timed out at 30 s under host load (load average above 8, with two reviewers building). K2b changes no TypeScript; the timeout is not raised, and the surface is re-run.

## K4: spawn and rulings (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

- **K4 (W1a, the retained-precision kernel method) is spawned as I12** from main `e7d930d49`, where K1, K3 and K2b are merged. A TASK drafted the brief (`TASK_BRIEFS/I12_K4_IMPLEMENTATION.md`); ROOT reviewed it, and the rulings on its questions Q1–Q12 are in the brief. In short:
  - kernel only, with no gate;
  - the multi-term exact sum in K4's own file;
  - the `exact_sum.rs` accessor approved;
  - the ceiling: no p + 64 residual, with the argument derived and checked;
  - budgets: the mechanism only, with no limits, and **F2a does not merge without ROOT's limits** from K6 and V-P; **[Amended: from K6 and V-K, with V-P revisiting them after F2a. See "K4: Q5 amended" below (RV13-S3).]**
  - a kernel `DirectionalSpring`;
  - RCM ported into `factor.rs`;
  - the site-table extension;
  - the export by the first consumer;
  - canonical encodings, hashed downstream;
  - K3's outcome type;
  - one slice.
- **Design text made stale by K1, K2b and K3** [or found inconsistent within the design (RV13-N9)], recorded here as rulings. `DESIGN.md` stays hash-pinned.
  1. §4.1.1's `wide.rs` is now `wide.rs` (K3a, L = 2) plus `wide/multi.rs` (K3, L = 4, 8 and 16). K4's p = 128 and 192 run at L = 4.
  2. §4.1.2's "one accumulation discipline … shared with `FK/exact_sum.rs`" holds for binary64 terms only. p-bit sums use K4's primitive.
  3. §4.1.2 item 5's projection is K3's `from_integer` plus K4's netting accessor.
  4. §4.1.3's "RCM … shared with the binary64 sparse path" cannot be shared across crates. K4 ports it, and V-K tests the equality.
  5. §4.1.4 with §4.1.6: there is no p + 64 residual at the 1024 ceiling (Q4).
  6. §4.1.7's "No implementing slice ships without them" binds the product-wiring slice (F2a), per C4's measurement order. **[Amended: the limits come from K6 and V-K, which precede F2a; V-P follows F2a and revisits them. See "K4: Q5 amended" below.]**
  7. §4.1.1's springs are extended with the kernel-only `DirectionalSpring`, for §4.10's directional kernel springs.
  8. §5 item 7's outcomes are carried by two types, K2b's `Representability` and K3's `Binary64Outcome`. F2a unifies them, including the zero conventions.
  9. MOD-D's export gap: the first consumer outside FK adds the `pub use`.
  10. §4.10 and §7.1's "LEF-small … solved": the ordinary route refuses it with `DegenerateAxis` (K2b ruling). Whether W1's source admits LEF-small is V-K's question; RF-RANGE is not in K4's row.

## K2b: ROOT's decisions at RV11's delta checks (ROOT, 2026-09-28; recorded late, RV13-S2)

These decisions were stated in ROOT's resume messages to I10. [Correction (RV13-D1): the committed evidence puts decisions 1 and 2 at RV11's resume; only item 3's rulings went to I10.] Until RV13's review of records PR #1042 found the gap, they were recorded only in K2b's RETURN (addenda 1 and 2) and in RV11's review. They are recorded here with their original dates. Nothing in them is new.
1. **The reaction check applies at every b, b = 0 included** (`IMPLEMENTATION/K2B/RETURN.md`, "The check applies at every b", where I10 left it "ROOT's call"; `REVIEW/K2B_REVIEW.md`, "ROOT's two decisions, against the code").
   - Where today's E12 would flush a subnormal product at b = 0, `force_scaled_reactions` refuses. F1b may keep today's E12 at b = 0 for byte identity.
   - RV11D-N2: the check is stricter than flushing requires, which costs availability only. **F1b's gate measures that cost.**
2. **`force_scaled_end_actions` stays off the pin list,** covered indirectly through the pinned `ForceScale` token. **Reversed** after RV11D-N1 (the `Default::default()` evasion, `RV11D-PIN-ACTIONS-EVASION`).
   - Both publication helpers, `force_scaled_end_actions` and `force_scaled_spring_action`, are named in `FORCE_SCALED_ENTRY_POINTS`.
   - The pin's doc records the text-pin limit beside RV8-N4's (`RETURN.md` A2.4).
3. **The rulings on RV11's first delta check** (ROOT's message; `RETURN.md`, addendum 2):
   - RV11D-1: a checked spring-action helper, pinned with probe F-S and a mutant;
   - RV11D-2: tests that kill the two surviving action mutants;
   - N1: both helpers on the pin list (item 2's reversal);
   - N3: the doc sentence corrected;
   - N2: recorded, with no change.
4. **For F1b,** in addition to `K2B_MERGE/RECORD.md`'s list: RV11D-N2 (item 1), and RV11D-N3 (no end-action variant takes load terms at scale).

## K4: Q5 amended (ROOT, 2026-09-28; RV13-S3)

- **The error.** The Q5 ruling said F2a does not merge without ROOT's limits, "set from the K6 and V-P measurements (C4)". But V-P follows F2a in DESIGN §6 (the V-P row, "after F1 and F2a") and in the selected order. As written, F2a could never merge.
- **Amended (RV13's option (a)):**
  - F2a does not merge without ROOT's per-case and per-invocation limits.
  - ROOT sets them from K6's measurements and V-K's kernel-lane runs, both of which precede F2a, together with K4's deterministic work counts. §4.1.7 asks for "W3/W5 measurements", which this admits.
  - V-P's product-lane measurements follow F2a, and confirm or revise the limits. A revision is its own ruling.
  - [Added (RV13-D2): this amendment creates the dependency "K6 and V-K before F2a's merge"; the selected order did not state it. It departs from C4's and D-8's "from the K6 and V-P measurements" for W1's budgets, and from nothing else.]
- Item 6 of K4's stale-design list, and the brief's Q5 ruling (`TASK_BRIEFS/I12_K4_IMPLEMENTATION.md`), carry bracketed pointers here. K4's own scope is unaffected: it ships the mechanism only.

## K4: rulings on I12's checkpoint-0 plan (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

I12's plan (`<wt>/scratch/i12/CHECKPOINT0_PLAN.md`, sha256 `e1253faa…`, 591 lines) is **approved as written**, with the rulings below. The plan and its scratch probes go into K4's `_run_records/` at checkpoint D.
- **Approved as positions or refinements,** each recorded in RETURN with the design's words:
  - the multi-term sum, `retained/wide_sum.rs`: stack magnitudes, a span limit of 8,128 bits that refuses, and one rounding through `from_integer`;
  - values only ever widen, and each lower-precision quantity is rounded once from its exact sum;
  - the pivot screen, the residual gate and the stop rule are decided exactly, with no binary64 γ;
  - directed roundings of the evidence ratios (the summary ratios upward, the pivot margin downward);
  - radix equilibration as in M03, with rcond on the equilibrated K;
  - RCM on the structural free–free pattern. V-K's equality test feeds both paths the same adjacency;
  - the negative-energy allowance;
  - frame dot products formed exactly. This is a refinement of D1's "every operation rounded to p": it is strictly more accurate, with a single rounding per step;
  - the brief's item C holds at p = 53 on normal results only, with the exact-projection form added;
  - item E's K-D5 cross-check is a test-only port;
  - factor reuse. Each case's limit counts the full shared work, and the invocation meter counts it once;
  - the budget API (required parameters, no `Default`, no numbers);
  - the canonical encodings;
  - O3, ids on members, springs, stations and groups;
  - O4, a span refusal is terminal and the maximum span is recorded;
  - O6, the K4-M16 control;
  - O7, the combination rules;
  - O9, unpublishable rows are listed, excluded from S\* and the classification, and F2a decides their standing;
  - O10;
  - O12, M03's coalesced denominator. [Reversed: see "D1 revision 5a.3: rulings on V4's verification", V4-S3 (RV16-S4).]
- **O1: Q6 amended. A body with a directional ground that does not span R³ skips the geometric witness; it is not refused.**
  - **The problem.** As ruled, Q6 refused a body whose directional springs of one kind do not span R³. That refuses RF-SKEW-T-PIN-AX's six cases. Each is restrained: both nodes are translation-pinned, and one rotational spring lies along the member axis. So §4.10's not-covered set would change, which is a stop item in the brief.
  - **Amended rule:**
    - Per node and kind, the directional springs **together with that node's global-axis springs and rigid DOFs of the kind** count as grounding the kind fully when their directions span R³, decided exactly. The kind is then passed to `assess_rigid_body` as grounded at that node.
    - A body with any remaining directional ground that does not span is **not assessed geometrically**: no witness is sought, and none of `assess_rigid_body`'s outcomes is used for it. It proceeds as `NumericallyUnresolved` does.
    - The attempt evidence records it: geometry not assessed, a non-spanning directional ground at node N, kind K.
  - **Why this is safe.** "A witnessed mechanism is refused and never escalated" (§4.1.3) is unchanged. Such a body is simply not witnessed. A true mechanism there fails the pivot screen or the rcond test at every p, or is rejected by the stop rule, so it ends unresolved and is never published. The design already relies on that for `NumericallyUnresolved` bodies. The cost is work only.
  - **Scope.** Directional springs are kernel-only; the product never builds one, so the product's geometry-first path is unchanged. RF-SKEW is 36 compared.
  - **Routed:** a full geometric treatment of partial directional grounds belongs to W4/K5's generalized assessment (§4.9). RETURN derives the safety argument above, and K4's reviewer checks it.
- **O2: the optional `SupportGroup` list is approved,** so that the per-support magnitude rows and `reaction_resultant` are formed at p and checked by the stop rule. F2a maps the product's supports onto groups.
- **O5: an evidence-level kill of K4-M11 suffices, under two conditions.**
  1. The killing assertion is on K4's returned attempt evidence, its correction count and golden work. F2a publishes these as evidence; they are not internal state.
  2. RETURN derives the published-value equivalence step by step, and the reviewer checks it independently.

  This follows the M31b lesson: an equivalence is accepted only when derived and checked, never by assertion.
- **O8: approved.** The generator emulates the method bit for bit for three tiny cases (N05 and N06 at 128 and 256, and one skew member at 128), and pins their retained-state sha256. If the emulation proves disproportionate at A, stop and report before falling back to Rust-produced goldens; do not fall back silently.
- **O11: measure at A.** If FK's debug suite grows by more than 20 minutes at opt-level 0, report it before B. Tests are never reduced or ignored. Splitting across test functions for parallelism is fine.
- **Q5, amended** (this file, "K4: Q5 amended"): K4 is unaffected. It ships the mechanism only.
- **The ceiling argument** (§11's two routes) goes into RETURN step by step, naming the uncertified step in each route. K4's independent reviewer checks it, as ruled under Q4.

## F1b: spawn and rulings (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

- **F1b (facade: the sparse wiring, the dense-scrutiny guard, and W2 at formation in the product) is spawned as I13** from main `e7d930d49`, where K1 and K2b are merged.
  - A TASK drafted the brief (`TASK_BRIEFS/I13_F1B_IMPLEMENTATION.md`); ROOT reviewed it and ruled on Q1–Q14 in the brief. In short:
    - the nonlinear loop stays out, and goes to T5;
    - W2 engages after the ordinary attempt and after exact-block, on linear invocations only;
    - at b ≠ 0 it admits only frames, ground springs, restraints, prescribed motion and nodal loads;
    - today's publication functions at b = 0;
    - R-b′'s Sensitive demotion is accepted;
    - W2 refusals are `NUMERICAL_INTEGRITY_UNRESOLVED`, with the exact template fixed at checkpoint 0;
    - the `range_scaling:` line is bounded by S11-G's `NAMED` limit;
    - a provisional dense-scrutiny ceiling (6 GiB estimated) and no sparse ceiling;
    - source recovery's dense view for n ≤ 256 only;
    - PHYS-R4 restated as a named refusal, if A2 confirms it;
    - the pin and site-test edits under K1's adapted conditions;
    - the b-rule as merged;
    - ROOT supplies the Mac gate baseline;
    - one slice.
  - K4 (I12) runs in parallel; their write sets are disjoint.
- **Design text made stale or found inconsistent,** recorded here as rulings. `DESIGN.md` stays hash-pinned.
  1. **The F1 row's and §4.8's line citations have drifted.** The assembly is now `PP:1826`, `:1957` and `:2276`; the reduction `:2726-2735`; the reactions `:3119`; `solve_preview_reduced_system` `:4392`; `dense_fallback_message` `:4490` (all on `e7d930d49`).
  2. **"The nonlinear loop moves to sparse"** (the F1 row, §4.6 and §4.8) conflicts with the selection's hard constraint, and K1's pattern path has no binary64 binding. The move goes to T5 (Q1).
  3. **"LEF-small and LEF-large solved"** (the F1 row, §4.10 and §7.1) is restated per entry in the brief's Scope §6:
     - LEF-small is refused at model build on both entries;
     - LEF-large is refused at capture on the captured entry;
     - on the typed entry, W2 publishes LEF-large Sensitive (Q5).
  4. **§4.7's "the public fixture then passes the evidence stage"** is unreachable with K2b's census, because the fixture's own exact-pressure operand is subnormal at formation. It is restated as a named refusal once A2 confirms it (Q10). The scaled formation of pressure operands goes on the T3-close list.
  5. **§4.7's admitted range assumes that loads are exact inputs.** PP forms some loads at b = 0 from products, and a term formed to exactly zero is invisible to the census. So W2 admits only authored nodal loads at b ≠ 0 (Q3).
  6. **§4.7's "the case stays `NUMERICAL_INTEGRITY_UNRESOLVED`"** is wrong for K2a formation refusals, which main publishes as `SOLVER_SYSTEM_BLOCKED` at the invocation. F1b publishes W2 refusals per case as `NUMERICAL_INTEGRITY_UNRESOLVED` (Q6).
  7. **§4.7's evidence line and §5 item 6** give no template for subnormal precision or record outcomes, and no composition with F1a's line (Q7).
  8. **§4.7's mechanism** (a private exponent on `AssemblyEvidence`, and a scaling `solve()`) was implemented by K2b as force-scaled siblings plus an orchestrator.
  9. **§4.8's "ROOT picks both from measurement," with C4:** V-P follows F1b, and K6 has not run. The ceilings are provisional (Q8).
  10. **§4.8's dense view for n ≤ 256** also concerns `source_receipt.rs`'s replay, which assembles its own dense K. That file is unchanged (Q9).
  11. **The design does not order W2 against exact-block,** and §4.4's coexistence rule covers W1 only. W2 runs after exact-block (Q2).
- **Added to the T3-close list:**
  - PHYS-R4 with pressure (the scaled formation of exact-pressure operands);
  - a scale-aware R-b′ bound (Q5(b)), which is also an input to F2a;
  - W2's coverage beyond nodal loads (Q3(b)), if a real case needs it.
- **The owner is told** of the provisional dense-scrutiny ceiling (Q8), which is a new refusal class for very large dense-scrutiny models, and of the PHYS-R4 restatement.

## F1b: rulings on I13's checkpoint-0 plan (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

I13's plan (`<wt>/scratch/i13/CHECKPOINT0_PLAN.md`, sha256 `ba90de63…`, 856 lines) is **approved**, with the rulings below. It goes into F1b's `_run_records/` at checkpoint D.
- **Approved as planned:**
  - the A1/A2 split: A1 is a pure refactor at b = 0 with no deferral, byte-identical everywhere;
  - `BasisStiffness` and the case loop (§2);
  - W2 only in the final failure arm;
  - the receipt's `OrdinaryAttempt` formed after W2 (t10b's single `passed(` call kept);
  - PP's two-arm range classifier, pinned against the orchestrator;
  - the publication path table (§3.4);
  - the guard's constant of 96 bytes per n² entry, as counted in the code. At 6 GiB the provisional ceiling is 8,192 DOFs, that is 1,364 chain members. OQ12's placement and input are also approved;
  - Q9's dense view with a shared `DENSE_SOURCE_DOF_LIMIT`;
  - the RV11D-N2 method (§13.3);
  - the C tests' sizes and bounds;
  - derivations D1–D9, each written in full in RETURN and checked independently;
  - the evidence-line template (§4.1).
- **OQ1: c2, not c1.** The census scope, meaning which terms are counted, is part of the b-rule. Five loops copied from SA's private `force_scale_census` would be a replicated rule, and K5 will edit SA.
  - The template prints `force_scale_exponent=<b>` only where the orchestrator's outcome carries b. Elsewhere it prints `range_scaling: attempted` with no b field, or `none` where no b exists (steps 2–3).
  - RV11-N2's b on the step-4 and non-range paths waits for an SA change that puts b on the refusal: K5 or F2a, recorded on F2a's input list.
- **OQ2: option B,** a zero-work named decline for a formation-range case. D2 derives that nothing is lost, and the reviewer checks it.
- **OQ3:** the `solve_ordinary(input, limits, attempt_scale)` wrapper, the one-line t10b anchor amendment and the lexer pin are approved.
- **OQ4:** approved. A `Structural(e)` failure at the chosen b keeps `append_integrity_failure`'s code mapping, under the W2 template. Formation and census errors are `NUMERICAL_INTEGRITY_UNRESOLVED`.
- **OQ5:** approved. The DEC-050/053 observation lanes do not run at b ≠ 0, and the mode row's observation fields are published as not observed, disclosed.
- **OQ6:** approved and disclosed. Rows derived from published values stay today's binary64, and a non-finite result keeps today's refusal.
- **OQ7:** confirmed. Admission runs after the orchestrator.
- **OQ8:** approved as a declared write-set extension: `formation_guard.rs`'s `const NAMED` becomes `pub(crate) const NAMED`. It is a visibility change only, and S11-G's tests must be unchanged.
- **OQ9:** confirmed. Call-site-only updates in `src/source_receipt/load_state_join_tests.rs` and `load_state_tests.rs`; any assertion change stops the work.
- **OQ10, OQ11, OQ14 and OQ15:** approved.
- **OQ13, narrowed.** At b ≠ 0 a zero nodal load term is refused only when its authored value is nonzero, that is when formation at b = 0 produced a zero from a nonzero input. An authored zero is admitted.
  - If the authored value is not available at that point, refuse every zero term and disclose it.
  - Subnormal formed terms are already refused by the census.
- **The refusal template (§4.2)** is fixed as proposed, with OQ1's c2.
- **The C1 list** (28 runs, proposed from G1's Mac base data) is ruled at A2 with the product-run table, as the brief says.
- **The gate's comparison scope.** G1's baseline (`GATE_BASELINE_MAC_E7D930D49/`) keeps P1's `run.envelope` summary bytes, not the full `MechanicsEnvelope`.
  - At A2, I13 states exactly which published fields that summary covers and which it omits, including diagnostic messages, receipts and rows.
  - If it omits published bytes, I13 proposes a probe variant that also emits the sha256 of the full serialized envelope, without changing `run_one`'s classification. ROOT then has G1 re-run the base's part 1 with the variant, which takes about 5 minutes, before B.

## K5: spawn and rulings (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

- **K5 (W4: the constrained-body witness and the curved rule) is spawned as I14** from main `24dea2dae`, whose product tree equals `e7d930d49`'s.
  - A TASK drafted the brief (`TASK_BRIEFS/I14_K5_IMPLEMENTATION.md`); ROOT's rulings on Q1–Q11 are in the brief. In short:
    - W4 only in the four `selected` formation-checked branches;
    - curved slots qualified by their matched source, with a derived condition;
    - T4's confirmation not a prerequisite;
    - a libm-free screen in the new function;
    - ties for today's element, with a T4 tripwire;
    - directional ground rows in K5's API;
    - a new mixed-family basis text; [Reversed to Q7 (a), and K5-C3 retired: see "K5: rulings on I14's checkpoint-0 plan" (RV16-S4).]
    - gate part 1 as a regression net;
    - no site-table change;
    - the curved-formation item not K5's;
    - one slice.
  - K5 runs in parallel with K4 (I12) and F1b (I13); none of the three edits another's files. **Its checkpoint 0 is a plan only.** ROOT serializes its heavy phases (builds, T9, mutation batches, gate) against the other two.
- **Design text made stale or found inconsistent** (the brief's list, items 1–17), recorded here as rulings. `DESIGN.md` stays hash-pinned.
  1. §4.9's and §2.5's citations have drifted; the brief re-locates them on the base.
  2. §4.9's SUP-17 paragraph was delivered by F1a.
  3. §4.9 does not say which entries W4 applies to. The answer is the four selected branches (Q1).
  4. §4.9's curved screen conflicts with R5-4, which says `curved_formation` does not bound the chord mismatch. Slots are qualified by source, and the screen is evidence (Q2).
  5. §4.9's "Coordination" and D-9 (T4 confirms) conflict with R5-4 §5 and §4.3.1. T4's confirmation is not a prerequisite (Q3).
  6. §4.9's ties assume positive stiffness, but §4.3.1 and D5C-2 call lateral zero "the only realized form". In fact the ordinary route realizes no user element. Ties are for today's element with positive stiffnesses (Q5).
  7. T4's M07 repair will change the user element's zero-energy set; a tripwire guards it (Q5).
  8. §4.9's "existing SVD rank screen" is platform-dependent through `hypot`. The new function is libm-free (Q4), and `assess_rigid_body`'s `hypot` goes on the T3-close list.
  9. §4.9 gives no data path for curved node coordinates. They come from `curved_sources`, which only the selected entries receive.
  10. §4.9's "with a reason" has no carrier in `StructuralReport`, which is Debug-published. The reason lives in K5's return types.
  11. The K5 row omits the two site tests that scan SA. Neither changes (Q9).
  12. §6's and D-10's serialization of K5 with the `SA` and `FK/structural.rs` sharers is stale. K5 runs in parallel with K4 and F1b.
  13. §4.1.3's "W4 generalizes": W1b (F3) and W1c will call K5's function.
  14. K4's O1 amendment routed directional grounds to W4, whose grounds were DOF-indexed. K5's API accepts directional rows (Q6).
  15. The curved-formation T3-close item's "to K5" route is withdrawn; it stays on the T3-close list (Q10).
  16. RF-MECH has no user or curved mechanism, so W4 has no frozen reference. Its tests are constructed with an exact generator.
  17. The K5 row's "seeded negative" becomes an explicit or unmatched slot, and the screen is recorded evidence (Q2).
- **Added to the T3-close list:**
  - `assess_rigid_body`'s `hypot` dependence (frame-only bodies);
  - wiring K4's geometry-first check to K5's directional rows.

## F1b: I13's A2 stop on the non-finite mechanics test (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

- **The stop.** With W2, `lib.rs` `tests::audit_nonfinite_computed_mechanics_never_publishes_solved_rows` behaves differently. Its model is linear, with a 1e308 N load.
  - It now range-triggers, W2 publishes the direct values, and the derived stresses overflow.
  - The invocation is then blocked by today's `SOLVER_SYSTEM_BLOCKED` ("computed mechanics must be finite") and `ELEMENT_FORCE_RECOVERY_FAILED`, not by the case's `NUMERICAL_INTEGRITY_UNRESOLVED`.
  - No wrong value is published. This is OQ6 as ruled.
- **Ruling: (a), tightened.**
  - Only the test's third assertion changes, and it asserts the one deterministic new outcome in both modes: the range line, then the non-finite block.
  - The no-solved-rows assertions are unchanged.
  - It is an approved assertion change, declared in CHANGE_RECORD and RETURN.
  - OQ6 stands; option (b) is not taken, and (c), a changed test input, is refused.
- **A new C1 outcome class:** W2 publishes at b ≠ 0, then the derived-row non-finite check refuses the invocation.

## K4: A1 findings F-1 to F-3, the stop rule's blind spot (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

I12's A1 (`cef218a10`) found that the stop rule, which compares p with 2p and forms S\* from computed values only, **cannot see information lost identically at both precisions.** The probes are in `<wt>/scratch/i12/a1_probes/`.
- **F-1: a combination published wrong zeros labelled exact.**
  - The combination was formed as Σcᵢuᵢ of operands whose loads differ by a relative 2^-1060. It was selected at 128 with every row 0, as `AbsoluteVerified{bound 0}`. The truth is nonzero.
  - **Ruling: option (a).** A combination is its own solve.
    - Its right-hand side is one exact expansion of the combined ledger Σcᵢfᵢ and the combined prescribed coupling, rounded once to p. Its prescribed values are the exact combination, rounded once.
    - It reuses the cached factor of the shared stiffness source, and runs its own schedule and stop rule.
    - The operands' results never change.
  - The Σcᵢuᵢ formulation is withdrawn. This refines §4.1.1 and §4.1.2 ("combinations … formed exactly and rounded once") within their intent: with a linear, shared K, the two are equal in exact arithmetic, and (a) avoids the cancellation.
  - B1-E must still be caught, and the CEIL-NET truth reproduced.
- **F-2: a single case published wrong zeros labelled exact.**
  - One member, a prescribed ux = 1 (EA/L = 512), and a load of 2^-300.
  - u cannot represent 1 + 2^-309 at 128 or 256, so the end actions and reactions are 0 at both, and S\*(force) = 0. The case is selected at 128 as exact, but the truth is N = 2^-300.
- **F-3: an availability gap.** An unloaded body moved rigidly by prescribed values leaks reactions of about 2^-(p−27) at every p, and ends Unresolved at the ceiling. It is safe; nothing wrong is published.
- **F-2 and F-3 are a design gap in D1 §4.1.6 and §4.1.6.1** (S\* has no resolution floor tied to the elastic-action scale of the quantities' formation). **They refute §4.1.9's claim** that only a precision-independent, common-mode error can pass the stop rule. A precision-dependent loss below both p's and 2p's resolution passes too.
  - The fix changes S\*'s meaning, and so D2's published-row S\* and its G5a–G5c checks, which may then need the scale published as evidence. **ROOT does not improvise it.**
  - A design TASK drafts an addendum, "D1 revision 5a.3: the stop rule's resolution floor". It gives options, a derivation, the effects on D2 and on the discriminating controls, and a recommendation. It is independently verified, and ROOT selects.
  - **K4 does not reach checkpoint B until the addendum is selected and implemented in K4.** Until then, no K4 test pins the present behaviour of F-2 or F-3.
- **K4's ceiling argument** (§11, route 1 step 10 and route 2) leans on §4.1.9's claim. RETURN must restate it in light of the addendum.
- **The F2a gate is unchanged:** F2a does not merge without this addendum implemented, as well as the budget limits.

## K5: rulings on I14's checkpoint-0 plan (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

I14's plan (`<wt>/scratch/i14/CHECKPOINT0_PLAN.md`, sha256 `7f50c788…`, 943 lines [942 lines with a final newline (RV16-N1)]) is **approved**, with the rulings below.
- **Approved as planned:**
  - the FK API: `assess_constrained_bodies` over one connected body, the `ConstrainedGround` rows including directional rows, `TieRefusal`, and canonical input ordering;
  - the tie reduction, six unknowns per body, derived in RETURN against the full stacked map;
  - the libm-free screen: a power-of-two characteristic length, the `sqrt` forms of the Jacobi `hypot`, and m counting nonzero rows;
  - the exact witness with canonical scaling;
  - curved qualification by K-D5's source match plus coordinate agreement, with the Q2 condition derived in RETURN;
  - the SA wiring on the four selected bodies only, with no public signature change and the contact-seed guard closed by derivation;
  - Q9, no site-table change;
  - the test, mutant and product-run lists;
  - gate part 1 compared directly with G1's baseline, since the product trees are identical;
  - positions P1–P11.
- **The Mac-main product run is recorded.** The constructed curved mechanism is refused `NUMERICAL_INTEGRITY_UNRESOLVED` (a pivot failure) on main at 0 m, about 1 km and 5e6 m, on both entries and in both modes. So on this corpus K5-C1 changes a refusal's code to `NUMERICAL_INTEGRITY_PHYSICAL_MECHANISM` with a direction, and **removes no published result.** Checkpoint B's corpus uses dyadic geometry, because non-dyadic bends at 5e6 m are refused earlier by the curved-bend radius check.
- **S1: Q7 is reversed to (a). The basis text is unchanged on every entry.**
  - A selected-only text breaks at least seven K-D5 tests that compare the selected branch's report `Debug` with the unselected path's. A text on every entry would change nonlinear invocations, which is forbidden.
  - The text "physical rigid-null witness unqualified for bodies containing user/curved elements" now under-claims on the selected branches. That is conservative, and is recorded.
  - Correcting it is on the T3-close list and F2a's input list, where the publication types are unified.
  - K5-C3 no longer exists.
- **Brief correction, recorded:** `invented_preview_model.json` is refused at `PP:1711` (legacy pressure), not at the joint check. The conclusion, that no element is built, holds.

## F1b: rulings on I13's A2 (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

A2 is committed as `e215c6007` on `codex/piping-f1b-20260928`. Every Scope §6 prediction was confirmed by a product run.
- **(a) The admission order is approved.** Thermal/eigen, pressure thrust and exact-pressure operands are now checked before the element-primitive check. Only the reported family names change; the set of refused cases is the same.
- **(b) Three admission checks cannot be reached in the product:** user-stiffness element, pressure thrust, and non-nodal term. They are pinned at unit level, and RETURN derives why each is unreachable.
- **(c) Coexistence: I13's derivation is accepted, with a condition.** [Superseded: RV17-1 showed that exact-block does select range-triggered cases (CX-F, CX-G), so the next sentence is false. See "F1b: rulings on RV17's review".] Exact-block cannot select a range-triggered case: its exact solve fails at `exact_radix` or at source closure, and large-magnitude triggers never reach the captured entry.
  - The candidates were tried on Mac main, and the gate base has 16 selections, none after a Range.
  - **Condition:** the derivation is written step by step in RETURN, and F1b's independent reviewer checks it (the M31b lesson). The candidate-side test stays.
- **(d) The mixed captured invocation is pinned as observed.** It finalizes with a `partial` receipt: A `qualified`, B `unsupported` with OQ2's decline, and B's `ordinary_attempt` following W2's verdict (OQ15).
- **(e) and (f) are approved under Q10 and Q11:** the NI K2b pin's product half as the declared table `F1B_PRODUCT_SITES` and `F1B_PRODUCT_NEVER`, and the restated linear variants.
- **The C1 list is approved: 28 runs,** equal to the proposed list:
  - 14 published: CHAIN-E-1000 ×4 at b = 540, Sensitive; THIN-B ×4 at b = 536, `CHECKS_PASSED`; the three LEF-large cases, typed ×2 each, at b = −702;
  - 6 refused by W2's template;
  - 8 in the new class "W2 published at b ≠ 0, then the derived-row non-finite check refuses": CONT-E-1000 and SKEW-E-1000 ×4 each, where `displacement_magnitude` overflows.
  - The gate's PASS requires C1 ⊆ this list, **0 trusted breaches** (the published range cases are checked against the references), and C3 byte identity elsewhere. [Also required: no C2 sparse run aborts at the heap cap (`TASK_BRIEFS/I13_F1B_IMPLEMENTATION.md` PASS conditions; RV16-S2).]
- **The full-envelope probe variant is approved,** and it is the method for every gate from now on:
  - P1's `main.rs` plus `full_envelope()`, which emits `run.envelope_sha256` over `serde_json::to_vec(&MechanicsEnvelope)`;
  - `sha2` is added to the probe's own `Cargo.toml`;
  - `run.envelope` is unchanged, and `compare.classify` is unaffected.
  - P1's summary omits published bytes (I13's A2 §7), so C3 byte identity is judged on the full hash. **G1 re-runs the base's part 1 with the variant** before any gate compares against it.
- **RV11D-N2:** 0 refused and 0 mismatched across 766 runs of b = 0 publications (3,666 reactions, 251 spring actions, 3,456 end-action sets).
  - The 13 gate cases of 1,000 or more members are observed in F1b's gate slot, typed and in sparse mode, where the candidate completes them.
  - The 10,000-member cases are included only if sparse mode completes them within the gate's limits; otherwise their omission is disclosed.
- **The b-rule (Q12):** of the 38 `ScaledEvaluation` refusals probed at every even b in [−1100, 1100], only K2b's documented limitation chain has a solving b. It stays a documented limitation, and the refinement stays on the T3-close list.

## D1 revision 5a.3: rulings on V4's verification (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

V4 (`DESIGN_NUMERICS/REV_5A3_CANDIDATE/V4_VERIFICATION.md`, sha256 `0222d0ec…`): **NOT VERIFIED**, with 0 BLOCKING, 7 SHOULD-FIX and 13 NOTEs.
- **What held:** option (iii)'s rule held under V4's independent emulator, which is built from K4's Rust with its own exact oracle.
  - On 200 saturating models, today's rule made 38 false claims and (iii) made none.
  - Φ = 2^-438·Ê is correct.
  - V4 re-counted λ from K4's Rust at ≤ 68g units, against DS1's 139g; both are within 2^8.
- **DS1 revises the candidate to resolve every SHOULD-FIX item, and V4 then runs a delta check.** ROOT selects only after VERIFIED. ROOT's decisions on the two items that are ROOT's to make:
  - **V4-S2: the premise becomes a runtime check, not an accepted risk.** The premise, that the solve's backward error carried into forces and moments stays within V, remains a conjecture.
    - DS1's §8.1 estimator is adopted: one extra correction solve at 2p from the exact residual K4 already forms. A case whose estimate exceeds V escalates, and at the ceiling it is Unresolved. [Amended: the estimate is tested at W ≤ V/4, and the gate is hybrid; see "D1 revision 5a.3: rulings on V4's delta check at R2" (RV16-S4).]
    - The revision specifies it exactly, with its work charged and its mutant.
    - Rationale: the standing lesson. A claim relied on for publication is derived or checked, never assumed.
  - **V4-S3: my O12 ruling is reversed.** The residual gate's denominator becomes the bounded operator, at contribution level, not M03's coalesced |K||u|. [Amended: the hybrid bounded-denominator gate; see "D1 revision 5a.3: rulings on V4's delta check at R2" (RV16-S4).]
    - V4 found in emulation that the coalesced form refuses an ordinary loaded cantilever at every precision when y_reference has a chord component: y_ref (3,4,5) on a (3,4,0) run, with a gate ratio of about 6e15.
    - The revision specifies the denominator. K4 builds a Rust control for that cantilever and confirms it before checkpoint B.
- **The other SHOULD-FIX items, resolved in the revision:**
  - **S1:** the demotion claim is restated with its threshold, |q| < 2^-472·Ê.
  - **S4:** V, Φ and G5b's item 6a are computed from the same binary64 ê, bit for bit.
  - **S5:** g, the directional blocks, the unpublishable rows and E's rounding direction are specified computably.
  - **S6:** behavioural controls are added for M2, M7 and M10.
  - **S7:** a published-data lower bound on ê (V4's) is added to G5a, so a D2 reader can check it at p = 512.
- **NOTEs to carry:**
  - **the saturated-assembled-entry reaction** (−1.5 N published `relative_verified` against a truth of 0): add a control;
  - **the combination's prescribed rows are rounded twice when published** (1 + 2^-53 + 2^-150 publishes 1.0 at p = 128). **This is a K4 defect, independent of S\*.** K4 fixes it now: publish from the exact sum, rounded once;
  - **the binary64 publication rounding** can exceed b by up to 2^-24·b [2^-23·b, per V4-R7's erratum (RV16-S4)]. The guarantee's statement says so; the gap already existed in 5a.2;
  - Lemma 2's binade-boundary hypothesis is corrected.

## Resume after the pause, and F1b's heap-cap finding (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

- **Resumed** from `PAUSE_2026-09-28.md`. The Mac stayed up and the memory guard kept running. Main is unchanged at `24dea2dae`. GEN-8 passes on the pause commits.
- **K5 (PR #1044):** hosted CI is green on `b379e5b27`, and the full-SHA dispatch 36459966791 (target_base `24dea2dae`) succeeded. RV14's review resumes from its pause state.
- **F1b gate part 1** (candidate `948e0bb99`, full-envelope, against G1's full base):
  - [Part 1 FAILED its own gate condition: 4 C2 sparse runs aborted at the heap cap, which the F1b brief makes a stop; I13's comparison reads `RESULT: FAIL`. `gate_check`, which checks trusted breaches only, passed (RV16-S2).] `gate_check` PASS; C3 has 832 runs with 0 differences; C1 is exactly the ruled 28; all 12 dense C2 runs get the guard's refusal.
  - Of the 12 sparse C2 runs, 8 complete with named M03 refusals. **4 abort at the heap cap:** RF-LARGE-CONT-n10000-AX and -ROT, both entries.
  - The allocation is in main's unchanged DEC-050/053 observation lane: `solve_symmetric_system_from_entries` → `SymmetricProfileMatrix::from_entries`, in identity order. For CONT n10000 that profile is 675,179,982 entries (5.4 GB), and it is built only to report `original_profile_entry_count` and `original_max_half_bandwidth`. On main the same runs aborted earlier, at the dense K.
- **Ruling: guard the observation lane in PP (F1b's write set).**
  - Before the lane runs, PP estimates its original-order profile from the pattern in O(nnz), with no allocation.
  - If the lane's estimated bytes exceed the provisional 6 GiB ceiling (the named constant of Q8), the lane is not run, and its observation fields are published as not observed, with a named reason. This follows OQ5's precedent at b ≠ 0.
  - **Conditions:**
    1. **Derived in RETURN and checked by the reviewer:** no case main publishes can exceed the lane ceiling, because main's dense path needs far more memory first. So no byte changes for any case main publishes.
    2. **Tests:** the estimate equals the lane's actual profile count on the B corpus; there is a lowered-ceiling unit test through the `#[cfg(test)]` hook; and there is a mutant that removes the guard.
    3. The PP suite and T9 are re-run.
    4. **Gate part 1 is re-run in full on the new head,** and then part 2. The 4 CONT sparse runs must no longer abort. What they publish or refuse instead goes in C2's table.
  - A sparse ceiling for the main solve stays unset in F1b (Q8). Only this observation lane is guarded.
- **D1 5a.3:** V4's delta check of R2 resumes from its pause state, including its open lead (a saturated stiffness entry amplified by a soft mode).

## D1 revision 5a.3: rulings on V4's delta check at R2 (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

V4's delta check at R2 (appended to `V4_VERIFICATION.md`, sha256 `c2f5539b…`): **NOT VERIFIED**, with 1 BLOCKING, 1 SHOULD-FIX and 6 NOTEs.
- **V4-R1 (BLOCKING): the estimate misses a saturated assembled stiffness entry.**
  - LEVER2 is an exactly representable lever with gain 2^90, a prescribed rigid translation, and a tip spring 2^-580 of its assembled diagonal, so the spring is lost in every assembled entry up to 576 bits.
  - R2 selects it at 256 with W/V = 0, and publishes 0 `absolute_verified` against a truth about 1,000 times its bound.
  - This refutes R2's claim of a 2^72 margin for the K^q term.
  - **Ruling: adopt V4's demonstrated fix.** W's residual is formed as one exact sum over the element contributions [and the directional-block entries (RV16-N3)] and spring stiffnesses, not over K^q's rounded assembled entries. In V4's emulation, LEVER2 is then refused and no control changes.
- **V4-R2 (SHOULD-FIX): the estimate recomputes its residual on the final state,** not reusing the gate's last evaluation. The R1 fix requires this anyway. SEEDED-COMMON must be caught.
- **DS1's two departures from ROOT's rulings are confirmed,** on V4's derivations:
  - **the hybrid gate:** acceptance on the bounded denominator, with refinement driven by the coalesced ratio. What is published is decided by the stop rule, V and W on the final state;
  - **the estimate's test W ≤ V/4:** resolution (68) plus estimate (64) is 132 of V's 256 units, whereas a test at V would allow 324.
- **NOTEs to carry into R3:**
  - V4-R5: apply the bounded test to the best state, not the last;
  - §1's "20 selected at 128" is labelled emulation-only;
  - the Lemma 2 proof is repaired;
  - G5a item 4 takes values after unit conversion;
  - V4's two errata are recorded as corrected.
- **Next:** DS1 writes R3, and V4 runs a delta check. ROOT selects only after VERIFIED. K4 stays blocked until then.

## K5: rulings on RV14's delta check at 28517eaaa (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

- **Verdict accepted:** PASS, 0 BLOCKING. RV14's four SHOULD-FIX findings and N1, N2, N5 are resolved; RV14-M1 to M4 are each killed by a new test (review committed at `f3e50948b`).
- **RV14-D1 (SHOULD-FIX): fix before merge.** I14 adds RV14's construction as a `P` expectation (nodes (0,0,0) and (2^1023,0,0), grounds d2 to d5, directional row n = (2^-60, −1, 0) at node 0; expected: refused as "parameters not representable"), and shows mutant RV14-M5 (finiteness test only) killed.
  - **Host timing:** I14 writes the test now but builds and runs nothing until F1b's gate part 2 has finished, because part 2's timed runs need a quiet host.
  - **Review:** RV14 checks the delta.
- **RV14-D2 (NOTE): accepted as a conservative limitation, not changed in K5.** A refused witness ends the candidate search with `NumericallyUnresolved`, even when a later candidate would publish.
  - **Why not change it now:** the result is a refusal, never a wrong value, and it is reachable only through the FK API. Moving on to the next candidate would change FK's result classes and the probe hash, which would reopen the oracle and probe checks for no correctness gain.
  - **Where it is recorded:** I14 records it in K5's RETURN as a known limitation, and it joins the T3-close list as a candidate refinement.
- **DEC-025:** after the D1 fix and RV14's delta, on the final head, once F1b's part 2 frees the Mac.

## D1 revision 5a.3: rulings on V4's delta check at R3 (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

- **Verdict accepted:** NOT VERIFIED, with 1 BLOCKING (V4-T1) and 5 NOTEs [4 NOTEs, T2–T5; V4's verdict line says 5 (RV16-N1)]. V4's fix for V4-R1 is implemented faithfully, and V4-R2 to R8 are resolved.
- **V4-T1: adopt V4's closure, both parts together.**
  1. **The 3p + 64 option becomes specified text.** W's contributions are formed at q_W = 3p + 64 bits, capped at 1024. The extra formation pass is charged as work.
  2. **The runtime charge.** Add to §4.1.6.3 the test C_q = 62.5·2^-q_W·F·est·‖a_q·S‖₁·‖S·Ā·|u|‖_∞ ≤ 60·2^-2p·ê(body, kind), inside the 124 units V leaves; at p = 512, test it against 2^-22·b.
     - **The terms:** est is the verification's Hager–Higham estimate of ‖K̃⁻¹‖₁, S is K4's radix equilibration, Ā·|u| comes from E's reaction pass, and a_q is the recovery row.
     - **F is pinned:** it is the same allowance that the condition screen and W's accuracy already rest on, with no new uncertified step.
     - **On failure:** the precision is not selected at this p, and the next p is tried.
- **Rigour required in R4.** R4 bounds e_q beyond first order: the second-order remainder is bounded, or dominated, under the design's own screens, for example ‖K⁻¹δK‖ ≤ 1/2 with a factor of 2. Alternatively R4 states exactly which first-order step remains and why the screens make it safe. No step is left "argued".
- **Tests and mutants in R4's emulator:**
  - LEVER2 and TILT-LEVER are charged out or refused;
  - all 44 controls and the 20 probe cases keep their R3 precisions and classes at q_W;
  - a mutant that drops the charge is killed by a control that the charge alone refuses; [if no admissible control exists, R4 derives the equivalence and reports it, and ROOT rules (RV16-N2). R4 built one: CHARGE-SLENDER.]
  - a mutant that uses q = 2p + 64 for W is detected.
- **NOTEs:**
  - **V4-T2:** R4 drops its citation of V4's false R2 statement and records the erratum.
  - **V4-T3, T4, T5:** recorded as V4 states them. M16's survival is acceptable.
- **The limitation that remains, disclosed:** the honesty guarantee rests, to the factor F, on Hager–Higham's uncertified norm estimate. The condition screen and W already rest on it, and this closure adds no new reliance. R4 states it in §9, and ROOT carries it to the owner's list.
- **Next:** DS1 writes R4, V4 runs a delta check, and ROOT selects only after VERIFIED. K4 stays blocked until then.

## K6: spawn and rulings (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

- **K6 (harness observations) is spawned as I15** from main `41aeb2a02` [correction: the K6 branch was created at main `56dd72334`, which changes only `projects/chirality-app-v4/**`; the piping tree is the same (RV16-S1)]. It departs from the selected kernel order ("K4 … then K6 and V-K"): K6's binary64 half runs before K4, and K6b keeps the W1 part after K4 (RV16-N6). Its piping tree equals `24dea2dae`'s; K1 is merged, and K6's row needs only K1.
  - A TASK drafted the brief (`TASK_BRIEFS/I15_K6_IMPLEMENTATION.md`); ROOT reviewed it.
  - The rulings on Q1–Q13 are in the brief's "ROOT rulings for this slice". In short: binary64 now, W1 in a K6b after K4; SA's path through an in-repo path dependency; an 8 GiB cap, a heap cap at C − 512 MiB, and the admission rule; one ceiling run at 16 GiB, last and alone; a runner pytest under conditions; no dense run at 10,000 members or more.
- **Why now:** K6's measurements are what ROOT needs to replace F1b's provisional 6 GiB dense-scrutiny and observation-lane ceilings, and, with V-K's runs and K4's work counts, to set W1's budget limits before F2a merges ("K4: Q5 amended").
- **Host:** checkpoint 0 is read and design only. Builds wait until F1b's gate part 2 releases the Mac. Observation runs happen only in slots ROOT grants.
- **Design text made stale** (the brief's items 1–12), recorded as rulings; `DESIGN.md` stays hash-pinned:
  1. K6's inputs are kernel models; the RF-LARGE product requests are P1's, hashed in `gen_out_sha256.txt:122-145`.
  2. §4.8's stage list is read at public-API boundaries, including the geometry and formation-check stages the product path now runs.
  3. The only Linux peaks known are P1's product-level ones. On the Mac, admission uses them or the derived estimate times the measured ratio (Q3).
  4. The in-process heap cap from the platform calibration joins §4.8's host protection on macOS.
  5. "For W1, limbs per entry" moves to K6b, after K4.
  6. The kernel runner's home is `H/runner/`. §4.10's `numerical_robustness` home serves V-K's and V-P's product-level runs, which reuse the runner by path.
  7. D-8's and C4's "K6 and V-P" is read as amended: limits from K6 and V-K, revisited by V-P.
  8. §2.1's "about 100 bytes per n² entry" is superseded for the guard by F1b's count of 96. K6 measures the actual-to-estimate ratio.
  9. The DEC-050/053 legacy LU call is at `PP:2508` on `d1cc97ce4`. The identity-order lane is observed too (Q12).
  10. K6's sparse observation is a new pattern path; the old harness "sparse" path is left unchanged.
  11. §7.2's RF-LARGE expectation is now measured at product level (P1, and F1b's gate); K6 adds the kernel level.
  12. The DEC-050/053 pytest pins that read `H/src/lib.rs` constrain K6's edit there to one `pub mod` line.

## K5: rulings on RV14's review (ROOT, 2026-09-28; recorded late, RV16-S3)

These rulings were given in ROOT's message to I14 after RV14's review. They are recorded in K5's RETURN §16 on the K5 branch (`95c7501a7`) and in RV14's delta check, and are recorded here with their original date. Nothing in them is new.

- **RV14's review at `b379e5b27`:** PASS; 0 BLOCKING, 4 SHOULD-FIX, 5 NOTEs (`REVIEW/K5_REVIEW.md`, `3a17799e4`).
- **All four SHOULD-FIX findings are fixed before merge,** each with a test and a mutant killed from a clean archive:
  - RV14-1: two FK cycle-band cases;
  - RV14-2: an SA test on RV14's P1;
  - RV14-3: a PP test on `constructed_mechanism_r0.2_o0`;
  - RV14-4: `rigid_parameters` is exact, or the witness is refused.
- **RV14-4's behaviour.** ROOT offered I14 two options: refuse a witness whose [t/L, θ] is not exactly representable, or publish the parameters in a form that is always exact. RV14 had offered publishing `None`, or [t, θ]. I14 chose the refusal, with the named reason `CONSTRAINED_WITNESS_PARAMETERS_UNREPRESENTABLE`, and ROOT accepts it.
  - **Why:** the field keeps its documented meaning ([t/L, θ], as `assess_rigid_body` publishes it) for every published witness, and the refusal is conservative.
  - **Consequence:** on RV14's 4,226-case FK corpus, exactly the 349 witnesses that published a non-finite component change from W to U. Every other result is byte-identical. The affected cases have subnormal spans, reachable through the FK API only.
- **NOTEs:**
  - N1 (stale line numbers) and N2 (spring grounds killed only by `unwrap` panics) are fixed;
  - N3 and N4 take no action;
  - N5 (main moved) is resolved by ROOT's merge of main.
- **Erratum (RV16-N11).** The K5 merge commit `28517eaaa`'s message says "Merge main `df6d59e3c`", but its second parent is `65e2d6c2a`. RV14's delta check states the parents correctly. K5's merge record will disclose this.

## K6: rulings on I15's checkpoint-0 plan (ROOT, 2026-09-28)

I15's plan (`IMPLEMENTATION/K6/PLAN_CHECKPOINT0.md`, sha256 `4b4d9b27…`, 633 lines) is **approved**, with the rulings below. RV16-N4's ruling is implemented: every n² mode at 10,000 members or more, and CONT n10000 `lane-id`, is refused by name, independently in the runner and in the binary.

- **N10 (the known dense timeouts at 1,000 members):** record, finish the running tier, then stop and report.
  - I15's hypothesis, which is not yet a finding: the dense pivot screen refuses a pivot the skyline passes, and the refusal then runs the O(n⁴) dense witness.
  - If K6's stage timings or outcome classes confirm it, the result is a **solver finding on main's dense path**, not K6's to fix. ROOT routes it. It bears on the F1b gate's part-2 timeouts at the same sizes.
- **N11 (the slot):** B splits into separately granted slots:
  - **B1:** everything except T3b and the ceiling run;
  - **B2:** T3b, dense and lane-lu at 1,000 members;
  - **B3:** the Q4 ceiling run, last and alone.

  Use `--repeats 1` for the two timeout cases and for lane-lu; their memory figure is deterministic. The two-hour stop applies per slot.
- **N7:** approved. After the host is released, `--counts-only` may run at 1,000 and 10,000 members at A1–A2, one process at a time, under a 512 MiB cap. It does O(nnz) work with no n² allocation, so it is not a "run above 100 members" under Q13.
- **N9:** approved. Admission uses 96·n² + E_base. The claim ratio stays against F1b's bare 96·n².
- **N8:** approved. There are two peak models, with the cap enforced on the in-place one, and ρ = max(RSS, move).
- **N4:** confirmed. RF-LARGE's `y_reference` follows P1's rule.
- **N5 and N19:** approved. The copies of SA's and PP's private items are pinned by test E and a mutant each.
- **N6:** approved. After K5 merges, K6 merges main and re-runs E. If E fails on frame-only models, that is a stop.
- **N15, the DEC-025 sandbox:** at A2, run the pytest wrapper once through the DEC-025 sweep entry, invoked as ROOT invokes it. If `ps` or `killpg` is denied, the test fails and is reported; nothing is skipped.
- **N18:** approved. `memorystatus_level ≥ 80` before each run, and the memguard log is checked after each tier.
- **N1–N3, N12–N14, N16, N17, N20:** approved as proposed. N14's 128×128 grid stays conditional, as the plan states.
- **Next:** A1 (the Rust side) starts when ROOT releases the host, after F1b's gate part 2.

## Records PR #1049 merged (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **Merged:** [PR1049](https://github.com/sgttomas/chirality/pull/1049) at head `720924cbc`, merge `0256decc6`, 2026-09-29 00:09:20Z, with `--match-head-commit`.
- **Review:** RV16's review at `04553ad05` PASSED: 0 BLOCKING, 5 SHOULD-FIX (all fixed in `adf43e1c5`), 11 NOTEs. Its delta check at `720924cbc` also PASSED, with 3 optional NOTEs.
- **Hosted CI on the head:** 7 passed and 6 were skipped, as selected for a records-only change.
- **RV16's delta NOTEs:**
  - D1: the work graph is updated after merge.
  - D2: R4:3 repeats V4's "5 NOTEs" miscount of its R3 check; the correct count is 4. R4 is not edited while V4 verifies it, and the erratum is recorded here.
  - D3: the PR body's blank-line disclosure also covers two K5 review run records that are not scripts.

## D1 revision 5a.3: rulings on V4's delta check at R4 (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **Verdict accepted:** NOT VERIFIED, with 0 BLOCKING, 4 SHOULD-FIX (V4-U1 to U4) and 5 NOTEs (U5 to U9).
  - V4-T1 is closed as ruled: the charge is implemented as specified, and the Lemmas, Theorem and Corollary hold step by step, apart from U5 and U8.
  - Lemma B's count is checked against K4's Rust source, including every stage DS1 had not re-checked.
  - No false claim was found.
- **V4-U1: adopt the certified bound. F·est is removed from every step of the guarantee.**
  - **The bound:** Uc = U/(1 − U·γ_m·‖|L|D|Lᵀ|‖₁), with U = ‖M(L)⁻ᵀD⁻¹M(L)⁻¹e‖_∞ taken from the verification's own LDLᵀ factor. Computed upward on nonnegative data, it bounds ‖K̃_P⁻¹‖₁ from above (derived).
  - **Where it replaces F·est:** in the charge (t₁, t₃), in the θ check, and in W⁺ and W's own accuracy wherever they use F·est. The Hager–Higham estimate may remain only where it serves availability (screening or escalation). It never bears on honesty.
  - **Why:** V4 demonstrated that, within the design's screens, the estimator's miss is unbounded (8.9e26 on a 12-DOF frame; 3.3e66 at p = 256), so no pinned F is a bound. Uc costs one substitution pair and one pass. On all 195 of DS1's states it is at least the exact norm and at most 0.0015·F·est, so it costs no availability there. Where it is loose, only availability is lost.
  - **Consequence:** R5's §9 must state whether any uncertified step remains. The owner-list limitation ("the guarantee rests on Hager–Higham to F") is withdrawn once R5 is VERIFIED.
- **V4-U2: adopt.** θ is tested per body, and the g check applies only to members in bodies that carry data. V4's two new controls must return to 128 under R5, and M20 and M23 must still be killed, on honesty if a case exists, otherwise on availability, stated as such.
- **V4-U3: adopt.** SEEDED-SOFT joins §7 and K4's controls, and kills M22 with a false claim under the mutant. M21 and M14 still survive: R5 builds a killing case for each, or derives that another test implies each and records the guard as kept for the derivation.
- **V4-U4: adopt.** F3's W1b obligation (§6.5) is corrected: the formed-load error is charged at its true size, with no 2^(q_W−6) under-charge, and the recovery side (E and the reaction-row count) is added.
- **NOTEs U5 to U9: fix in R5's text.**
  - U5: Lemma C's inequality at p = 512.
  - U6: M14's slack arithmetic.
  - U7: the M10 paragraph, whose error is first order.
  - U8: θ's rounding direction, and the ∞-norm the Theorem needs where the charge uses the 1-norm.
  - U9: the reliance wording, which changes with U1.
- **Also for R5:** RV16-D2's miscount (R4:3 says "5 NOTEs" for V4's R3 check; there were 4).
- **Next:** DS1 writes R5, V4 runs a delta check, and ROOT selects only after VERIFIED. K4 stays blocked until then.

## F1b: gate re-run on 130445db2 accepted; the Mac is released (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **Result: PASS** (I13; records in `<wt>/scratch/i13/gate2/`, SHA256SUMS over 3,456 files, verified by ROOT).
- **Part 1:** 884 runs against G1's full base (`runs.jsonl` `9139140c…`); candidate `runs.jsonl` `30d99bf0…`.
  - `gate_check` PASS: 0 trusted breach triples.
  - C3: 832 runs, 0 differences.
  - C1: exactly the ruled 28, with rows identical to the `948e0bb99` gate.
  - Nothing changed outside C1 and C2.
  - **C2: 0 sparse heap-cap aborts,** so the condition part 1 failed on `948e0bb99` now holds.
    - The 4 CONT n10000 sparse runs now publish `MECHANICS_SOLVED`, `sensitive` and `needs_recompute`, with `SPARSE_OBSERVATION_LANE_NOT_RUN` and the lane's fields `not_observed`. Peak RSS is 4.82–5.17 GiB.
    - The 12 dense runs get the guard's refusal. The 8 other sparse n10000 runs get named M03 refusals.
  - Against the `948e0bb99` gate, 880 of 884 runs are identical. Only those 4 CONT runs differ.
- **Part 2:** all 8 dense 1,000-member runs time out at 1,800 s on both sides, with no base/candidate mismatch. Each run's load is recorded, and there was one load wait. This matches K6's predicted dense-path timeouts (K6 plan, N10); K6's stage timings will show where the time goes.
- **RV11D-N2 on CONT n10000:** reactions and end actions are equal bit for bit (AX and ROT). 8 of the 13 cases are now observed, all equal.
- **Next for F1b:** D (CHANGE_RECORD, RETURN, records), then the PR, an independent reviewer, hosted CI with the full-SHA dispatch, DEC-025 and GEN-8.
- **Host released** at about 02:10Z. The order of use:
  - K5 stage 2 (I14; FK K5 tests and RV14-M5) and K6 A1 (I15) may build concurrently, each within its own 2-cargo-job limit.
  - Quiet-host slots follow, one at a time: DEC-025 for K5, then DEC-025 for F1b, then K6's B1, B2 and B3.

## D1 revision 5a.3: rulings on V4's delta check at R5 (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **Verdict accepted:** NOT VERIFIED, with 1 BLOCKING on availability (V4-V1), 1 SHOULD-FIX (V4-V2) and 5 NOTEs (V3 to V7).
- **Honesty is confirmed:**
  - Lemma D is correct against K4's `factor.rs` (`81f81f24…`).
  - In V4's stress test, Uc never fell below the exact norm in 46,315 factors where it existed.
  - "No uncertified step remains in the honesty guarantee" holds.
- **V4-V1: do not accept the loss. Add V4's shifted-factorization bound and take the smaller of the two.**
  - **Why:** Uc's comparison matrix loses every sign cancellation, and on R1's own RF-LARGE frames it grows geometrically along the elimination. At 100 members, five of six models leave 128. At 1,000 members, five of six would be Unresolved at every precision, however well conditioned they are. RF-LARGE-scale frames are what the product must solve, so this loss is not acceptable.
  - **The bound:**
    - Factor K̃_P − σI with the same loop. If every pivot is positive, then λ_min(K̃_P) > σ′ := σ − γ_m·N_L′ − (the shift's rounding), by Weyl and Lemma D's step 1, so ‖K̃_P⁻¹‖₁ ≤ √n/σ′. Form every step with directed rounding.
    - σ may be chosen from est; that is an availability use only.
    - A failed shift halves σ, a bounded number of times, then falls back to Uc alone.
    - The certified bound used is min(Uc, the shift bound), with the work charged.
  - **R5's R1 lane is extended to RF-LARGE** at 10, 100 and 1,000 members, in K4's elimination order, within emulation limits. R6's §1 and §9 report its selections honestly.
- **V4-V2: adopt per-body Uc and per-body shift bounds,** from the same passes. M17 and M24 then lose their kills. They are recorded as kept for the derivation, as M21 is, unless R6 builds a single-body kill.
- **NOTEs V3 to V7: fix in R6.**
  - V3: M21 is vacuous only for published W1a cases (DESIGN §4.2 admits nonzero support motion). Restate the scope, and drop "no other test implies it".
  - V4: the 1 + 2^-9.5 factor is derived, not measured.
  - V5: THETA-STUB's over-breadth in a decoupled zero-state block. Narrow θ further, or record why not.
  - V6: an encoding rule for a Uc of 2^1024 or more in the receipt.
  - V7: V4's own R3 count erratum.
- **Next:** DS1 writes R6, V4 runs a delta check, and ROOT selects only after VERIFIED. K4 stays blocked until then.

## K6: rulings at I15's A1 stop (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **The stop was correct.** Test D breached the DEC-053 parity basis (1e-9 relative) on three 100-member models: CHAIN-ROT at 7.15e-8, TREE-AX at 1.45e-8 and TREE-ROT at 4.78e-8.
  - In all three, both modes are **Sensitive**.
  - Test E shows both vectors are SA's own results, bit for bit. Bitwise K holds and the outcome classes agree.
  - Every Passed model is within 5.9e-11.
  - This agrees with P1's product-level finding at the same sizes (`DETECTION/RETURN.md:242-249`).
- **Ruling: option (a).** The DEC-053 basis is asserted where both modes are Passed. Where a mode is Sensitive, the delta is recorded and not asserted.
  - **Why:** a Sensitive publication carries no accuracy claim at that level. The product publishes it as `needs_recompute`, and that demotion is M03's statement that the integrity checks could not confirm the result. The outcome classes must still agree in every case; that stays asserted.
  - **Recorded as a stale-design item:** §4.8 item 3's "published quantities agree within the DEC-053 basis" is read as applying to Passed publications.
- **Questions:**
  1. `--counts-file` is approved: observation runs take counts from the counts-only record, checked by the model's canonical digest, with the estimates recomputed and the refusals kept.
  2. ρ for admission uses RSS net of a process baseline, measured in the same slot by a no-op run of the binary. Admission at 1,000 members or more uses ρ measured at 100 members or more.
  3. The CONT n10000 lane counts (675,174,982 ROT, 562,627,485 AX; F1b's 675,179,982 is the full-block form) are recorded as context. The run stays never-run.
  4. The TREE identity-bound erratum (75n − 72) and 5, the lane-id `ledger` stage, are accepted.
  5. The gap between product-level and kernel-level RSS (F1b's CONT n10000 at 4.8–5.2 GiB, against K6's kernel sparse estimate of about 0.38 GiB) is recorded. B1's ascent will measure the kernel side.
- **Disclosed slip:** I15 ran `git add -N` and `git reset -q` on `H/` in the k6 worktree, two index operations its brief forbids. The net effect is nil: the index is empty and HEAD is unchanged. Recorded; no further action.
- **Next:** A2 (the runner, its tests, the pytest wrapper, `--plan`, `--smoke`). While K5's DEC-025 sweep runs on the Mac, I15 writes code only.

## K5 merged (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **Merged:** [PR1044](https://github.com/sgttomas/chirality/pull/1044) at head `babcf5e65`, merge `1cdeae2c1`, 2026-09-29 03:18:22Z. The merge record is `IMPLEMENTATION/K5_MERGE/RECORD.md`.
- **DEC-025 on `babcf5e65`:**
  - the suites match the Mac baseline, except K5's added tests (FK +18, NI +13, PP +4) and the three known Mac platform failures;
  - pytest 3023 passed;
  - the wasm and production builds passed;
  - vitest failed once on `App.test.tsx`'s known 30 s render timeout, and the immediate re-run passed 2822 of 2822. K5 changes no desktop file.
- **Consequences:**
  - F1b merges second, so it merges main and re-runs its suites, T9 and gate part 1, which is quick at about 6 minutes, before its merge.
  - K6 merges main and re-runs test E (N6).

## K6: A2 accepted; schedule approved; B1 granted (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **A2 accepted.**
  - H's suite passes, and the runner's 27 tests pass, including the live watchdog and the negative control.
  - N15: the wrapper passes through the DEC-025 pytest surface's invocation, so `ps`, `pgrep` and process-group kills work in that context.
  - `--smoke`: staged is identical to SA's entry on 84 of 84 lines. The watchdog killed its child at 136,480 KiB against a 128 MiB cap, within one poll's growth. The heap-cap abort was classified `heap_cap_abort`.
- **Committed on the K6 branch:** A1 and A2 at `9ababe4f2`, with the records moved to the branch as for K5 and F1b. Main `1cdeae2c1`, which includes K5, is merged in at `1f354c20b`. It overlaps no K6 file.
- **N6:** before B, re-run test E and H's full suite on `1f354c20b`. A failure of E on frame-only models is a stop.
- **The schedule is approved** (`_run_records/a2/plan.txt`, sha256 `93cd36d5…`, 138 rows).
  - 14 rows are refused by name.
  - Grid 128×128 is deferred by name until ROOT rules on it after 96×96.
  - T6 (the ceiling run) is decided at B3, by the measured ρ under the rule as written.
- **B1 is granted:** T1 → T2 → T3a → T4 → T5.
  - B's binary is built from `git archive 1f354c20b`, and every record carries `--source-commit`.
  - **An added host condition** for timed runs, as the gate used: before each run, wait while the 1-minute load average is above 8, until it is below 6; record the load at start and end. Other agents are building intermittently. Memory figures are deterministic; timings carry the recorded load.
  - Send `--project` after T2. B2 and B3 are separate grants.

## F1b: rulings on RV17's review (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **Verdict accepted:** PASS at `f183e1fa9`, with 0 BLOCKING, 4 SHOULD-FIX and 5 NOTEs (`REVIEW/F1B_REVIEW.md`). All four SHOULD-FIX findings are fixed before merge.
- **RV17-1: A2(c) is re-ruled.**
  - My A2(c) premise, "exact-block cannot select a range-triggered case", is **false**. CX-F and CX-G (a 1 m member, EA/L ≈ 2^16 N/m, a tip load of 3·2^-1016 or 2^-1015 N) are range-triggered, and main publishes them `MECHANICS_SOLVED` through exact-block, with a receipt.
  - **Coexistence still holds, on a different ground.** The selected exact-block arm comes before the W2 arm, so wherever exact-block selects, F1b publishes main's bytes by construction. RV17 confirmed this on all 10 selected runs, on the recorded probe and on its own build.
  - **Fix:** I13 corrects D10, dropping the false step 4 and resting coexistence on the ordering. I13 also adds the brief's positive coexistence test with CX-F or CX-G (F1b equals main in full-envelope sha256, on both entries and in both modes), with a mutant that moves W2 before exact-block, killed.
- **RV17-2 and RV17-3: add the tests.**
  - Pin the nonlinear blocked envelope in full, which kills RV17-M1 (`let linear = true;`).
  - Add a two-spring W2 publication test, which kills RV17-M2 (every spring action taken from the first spring).
- **RV17-4: disclose it; "within the criterion" means trusted publications only.** 8 of the 14 published C1 runs are outside R1's exact references (up to 9.7e-8, and 1.7e-5 for SKEW-LEF-large). All are Sensitive and equal main's same-family Sensitive pattern.
  - This matches the K6 ruling: Sensitive publications carry no accuracy claim at that level, and `gate_check` counts trusted publications.
  - I13 records it in RETURN's C1 section.
- **NOTEs:**
  - N1 (RV17-M4 changes only the refusal text on an input main also refuses): recorded.
  - N2 (the lane's peak is about 16P + 24P′, while the guard estimates 24P for the identity build): recorded in RETURN. K6 measures the lane against both (Q12). The ceiling ruling will consider it; D12 is unaffected.
  - N3 (96 B per n² is the n² coefficient, not a total-heap bound; the largest admitted model is 3.1 MB under the ceiling): recorded. K6's B3 ceiling run measures it.
  - N4 and N5: recorded.
- **Next:** I13 makes the fixes (tests and records), with mutants from clean archives. Then RV17 runs a delta check, followed by hosted CI with the full-SHA dispatch, DEC-025 in a quiet slot (after K6's B1) and GEN-8.

## K6: B1 accepted; B2 granted (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **B1 accepted.** Records are committed on the K6 branch at `962dd4e3b`, with the runner fixes made during the slot, each tested and disclosed.
  - 110 of 125 rows ran, all ok. 14 were refused by name, and grid 128×128 was deferred.
  - All 21 cross-mode pairs agree on class, and staged equals SA's entry on every run.
  - N6 held: test E passes after K5's merge.
- **Findings, observations only:**
  - **Kernel sparse memory is linear in members:** the heap slope is 0.999–1.002 for CHAIN, TREE and CONT from 10 to 10,000 members. This confirms §4.8's single claim at kernel level.
  - **F1b's dense estimate is sound in its coefficient:** heap is 1.004–1.057 × 96·n² at 100 members. B2 adds 1,000 members.
  - **F1b's lane estimate:**
    - for CONT, heap-move / 24·P_id is 0.66–1.33, and RSS is 1.77× at 1,000 members;
    - for CHAIN and TREE, other buffers dominate (4.5–9.0×).
    - This bears on RV17-N2 (the lane's peak is about 16P + 24P′) and on the lane ceiling.
  - **The product-level gap:** CONT n10000 sparse is about 250 MiB heap in the kernel, against 4.8–5.2 GiB RSS at product level (F1b's gate). F1b's peak attribution puts most of the product's memory in result-row publication, not the solver.
    - **The dense-scrutiny and lane ceilings therefore cannot be set from kernel figures alone.** V-P's product-level measurements are needed. Recorded for the ceiling ruling.
- **B2 is granted (T3b):** dense and lane-lu at 1,000 members, with a projection of 1.53 h. **Grid 128×128 is admitted into B2's remainder** (E_adm × the measured ρ ≈ 1.54 GiB, within C/2; projected 3–4 min).
  - The two known dense timeouts (N10) run once each, and their stage timings are the record N10 needs.
  - The load-wait rule applies.
- **B3** (the ceiling run) is decided after B2 sets ρ from CHAIN dense at 1,000 members.

## K6: rulings at I15's B2 stop (Q3's premise measure) (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **The stop was correct.** The first dense 1,000-member run (CHAIN-n01000-AX, 5 of 5 repeats, 622 s, Sensitive in both modes) confirmed Q3's premise on requested heap (3,319 MiB) and on the macOS physical footprint (3,411 MiB), both below P1's Linux 3,605 MiB. It refuted the premise on RSS (4,782 MiB, above C/2).
  - I15's hypothesis, not tested: macOS keeps freed large blocks resident, so RSS accumulates across the stages' rising and falling heap peaks. Linux glibc unmaps large blocks, so P1's Linux `ru_maxrss` compares with the footprint, not with macOS RSS.
- **Ruling: option (a), with a safety condition.**
  - **Q3's premise and ρ are read on the macOS physical footprint** (`time -l` peak memory footprint; the measure macOS uses for memory pressure). It is the one comparable with P1's Linux RSS. RSS stays recorded beside it on every run.
  - **The watchdog stays on RSS,** at C, as the conservative host guard. It is unchanged.
  - **Added condition:** a run admitted by the footprint rule must also have a projected RSS of at most 0.8·C, where projected RSS = the footprint estimate × the largest RSS-to-footprint ratio measured in the same family and mode. Otherwise it is deferred by name.
    - For B2's remaining dense 1,000-member runs, that is about 4.8 GiB ≤ 6.4 GiB, so admitted.
    - For B3 at C = 16 GiB, about 8.7 GiB ≤ 12.8 GiB, so admitted, subject to B3's own grant.
  - **Why:** the rule exists to keep runs clear of the watchdog and the host safe. The footprint is the macOS measure of memory pressure; the heap cap still bounds live heap deterministically; the RSS watchdog still bounds resident memory; and the added condition keeps expected RSS below the watchdog with margin.
- **Recorded for the ceiling ruling.** At 1,000 members, F1b's dense estimate is exact in heap (1.005 × 96·n²) and close in footprint (1.033), but macOS RSS reaches 1.448 × 96·n².
  - So a product run just under the provisional 6 GiB dense ceiling could show about 8.7 GiB resident on macOS.
  - The ceiling bounds estimated heap, not resident memory. This goes to the owner's ceiling decision, with the product-level gap from B1.
- **Other figures:**
  - dense heap slope 1.975 over 100–1,000 members;
  - the dense `factor` stage takes 78.7 s at 1,000 members for the Cholesky (not an N10 case).
- **B2 resumes** under this ruling: runs 098–108, then grid 128×128. **B3** stays a separate grant.

## F1b merged (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **Merged:** [PR1052](https://github.com/sgttomas/chirality/pull/1052) at head `6fa422979`, merge `59cb20073`, 2026-09-29 05:31:23Z. The merge record is `IMPLEMENTATION/F1B_MERGE/RECORD.md`.
- **The gates, on the final head:**
  - RV17 PASSED, with its delta check PASSED as well;
  - hosted CI was green, including Linux's numerical suite, the first cross-platform check of the three hash pins;
  - the dispatch (36524065976) succeeded;
  - DEC-025: F1b's 41 tests are the only suite change, pytest and vitest were clean, and so were the builds;
  - the src-tauri suite: 116 of 116;
  - GEN-8.
- **Native witnesses: ruled as join items** (§7.5), as the brief proposed. The gate covers the product's solve path on both entries, the src-tauri suite covers the desktop's Rust side, and F1b changes no native shell or desktop file.
- **Still provisional, for the owner:** the dense-scrutiny and observation-lane ceilings at 6 GiB. The kernel-to-product gap and macOS RSS inflation are recorded from K6; V-P's product-level runs are needed as well.
- **Next on the facade path:** F2a, after D1 5a.3 is selected, K4 merges, and ROOT sets the budget limits from K6 and V-K.

## D1 revision 5a.3: rulings on V4's delta check at R6 (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **Verdict accepted:** NOT VERIFIED, with 0 BLOCKING, 1 SHOULD-FIX (V4-W1) and 2 NOTEs.
- **The design is confirmed:**
  - V4-V1 is resolved, and Lemma E is correct step by step.
  - V4's stress test (95,142 shifted factorizations, 14,186 bounds) found no case of S below the exact norm.
  - "No uncertified step remains" holds: the estimate only screens and chooses σ.
  - The per-block decomposition is sound.
  - RF-LARGE availability is confirmed independently. At 1,000 members, S/‖K̃⁻¹‖₁ is 2^7.09 to 2^7.29 against the exact binary64 norm, and S is at least the norm on all six.
- **V4-W1: fix the evidence in R7, with no design change.**
  - emu6 indexes the Hager–Higham estimator's vectors by elimination rank; K4 indexes them by free position.
  - R7 re-indexes emu6 as K4 does and reruns the estimate-dependent evidence: the mutants, the sweep, the controls and the HH-FOOL figures.
  - It corrects the HH-FOOL statements: the hidden block's miss is 2^37.8 at m40 and 2^97.8 at m100.
  - It records M24 as kept for the derivation, unless another control kills it. K4's control list must not expect HH-SLENDER-m40 to kill M24.
- **V4-W2:** R7 labels M27's "no selection kill at design precisions" as argued, since it rests on the estimate-based condition screen. M27's low-precision kill stands.
- **V4-W3:** R7 states that S is polynomially loose only when the estimate is within about 8× of the norm, and that otherwise availability falls back on Uc. It also states that up to three extra factorizations are charged to the work budget, and that their cost on large models is for K6b and V-K to measure.
- **Next:** DS1 writes R7, V4 runs a delta check, and ROOT selects only after VERIFIED.

## K6: B2 accepted; the dense-path finding (N10); B3 granted (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **B2 accepted.** Records and the B2-stop rule are committed on the K6 branch at `3799e3764`.
  - 13 runs were measured.
  - Every RSS stayed below its projection, at 0.61–0.97 of it.
  - Dense heap is 1.005 × 96·n² at 1,000 members, which confirms F1b's dense-estimate coefficient.
  - Factor time scales as n³.
- **Finding N10, confirmed, on main's dense path, not K6's code.** This is recorded as a T3 finding.
  - On RF-LARGE-CHAIN-n01000-ROT and TREE-n01000-AX, the dense Cholesky refuses a pivot at DOF 6001 or 6002 of 6006, after 65–86 s. The O(n⁴) dense pair witness then runs until the 1,800 s kill.
  - The time budget is not checked inside the witness.
  - The sparse path publishes both models as Sensitive, so dense scrutiny both disagrees in class and does not end.
  - F1b's gate part 2 shows the same timeouts at product level, on base and candidate alike. The behaviour predates F1b.
  - **Route:** a kernel follow-up slice, on the T3-close list, to be scheduled by ROOT. The slice bounds the dense witness, with a budget check inside it and a size limit or a cheaper witness above one, and it examines why the dense pivot screen refuses where the skyline passes, since I15's 2j + 2 screen-bound hypothesis is not proven.
  - Until then, product users running dense scrutiny on such models wait until they cancel the background job. The solve runs as a cancellable job.
- **B3 is granted:** K6-CEIL-CHAIN-n01364-AX dense, at C = 16 GiB with the heap cap at 15.5 GiB.
  - It is admitted under the ruled rule: a 7.78 GiB footprint estimate, within 8 GiB, and a projected RSS of 11.29 GiB, within 12.8 GiB.
  - It runs once, alone on the host apart from DS1's single `nice -n 19` emulator process, with the memory guard running.
  - If the dense factor refuses and the witness runs to the timeout, the memory figures at the refusal point are still the record B3 needs.

## K6: B3 accepted (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **B3 (the Q4 ceiling run), K6-CEIL-CHAIN-n01364-AX dense, 8,190 DOFs:** ok, 5 repeats, Sensitive, with no factor refusal and no watchdog or heap-cap event. It is committed on the K6 branch.
  - **Heap peak:** 6,459,755,398 B, which is 1.0032 × F1b's 96·n² (6,439,305,600 B) and 1.0027 × F1b's 6 GiB provisional ceiling (6,442,450,944 B).
  - **Footprint:** 1.0078 × 96·n².
  - **RSS:** 1.1010 × 96·n², which is 0.585 of the admission projection.
  - **The macOS RSS excess over footprint is not a function of size.** It was 1.402 at CHAIN n1000 under load and 1.093 at the ceiling.
- **Host context accepted.** A process outside this work (a Codex app-server job in another project folder) ran at nice 0 during B3. B3's recorded quantities are per-process and memory is deterministic, so it is accepted as disclosed. Timing is context only. ROOT did not touch the process.
- **Recorded for the ceiling ruling (owner-facing):**
  - At the kernel level, F1b's dense estimate is accurate to about 0.3% in heap at the ceiling. Actual resident memory on macOS runs 1.1–1.45× above it.
  - At product level the overhead is larger (K6 B1 and F1b's attribution).
  - The ceiling's final value is the owner's decision, with V-P's product-level measurements.
- **Next:** C (mutants), then D (records), then review.

## D1 revision 5a.3 SELECTED (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **V4's verdict at R7: VERIFIED**, with 0 BLOCKING, 0 SHOULD-FIX and 0 NOTEs (`REV_5A3_CANDIDATE/V4_VERIFICATION.md`, "Delta check at R7").
  - V4 reproduced DS1's claims with its own emulator, confirmed that the estimator's re-indexing matches K4's `condition`, and read all 57 hunks of the R6→R7 diff.
- **Selected: D1 revision 5a.3**, as specified by `REV_5A3_CANDIDATE/D1_REV_5A3_SSTAR_RESOLUTION_R7.md` (sha256 `5502aef9803f05f42e93c2a05a0de495401e3f94fe92adb19fc2a0c3f80d8f42`).
  - The governing text is R7's **§5, "The exact amended text (addendum blocks)"**, §5.1 to §5.9. It amends `DESIGN.md` revision 5a.2 at §4.1.3, §4.1.4, §4.1.6 (with the new §4.1.6.1 item 6a, §4.1.6.2 and §4.1.6.3), §4.1.9 and §5 item 1.
  - `DESIGN.md` stays hash-pinned at 5a.2. The addendum governs where it applies, and R7's derivation sections (§2 to §4 and §6 to §10) are its warrant.
  - The earlier candidates (the candidate and R2 to R6) and V4's intermediate verdicts are history.
- **What the selection establishes:**
  - W1a's honesty guarantee: every accepted precision satisfies b, derived with **no uncertified step**. The Hager–Higham estimate only screens and chooses the shift.
  - The formation charge with the certified bound B = min(Uc, S), per block. Uc is the comparison-matrix bound (Lemma D), and S is the shifted-factorization bound (Lemma E).
  - The Φ floor at 512, the verification estimate at W ≤ V/4, the hybrid bounded-denominator gate, and the best-state bounded test.
  - **Owner-list update:** the earlier limitation, "the guarantee rests to a factor F on an uncertified estimate", is **withdrawn**. R4's F was replaced by the certified bounds.
- **Open or argued, from V4's list, none of which is a step of the honesty guarantee:**
  - **Kept for the derivation, with no kill:** M17, M21, M24, and M27 at design precision.
  - **Availability-only kills:** M20, M23, M25, M26, M28 and M29.
  - **Argued:** M27's no-kill claim; the θ-binding interpretation of THETA-STUB-COUPLED; LEVER2's outcome under every elimination order.
  - **Measured, not proved:** the availability figures, and that no block is both est-fooled and Uc-loose.
  - **Standing premises:** Lemma B's count as V4 recounted it against the Rust; Lemmas D and E tied to K4's factor loop as read; K* nonsingular per body.
  - **Out of scope for now:** W1b until F3 meets its §6.5 obligations; the shift's cost on large models (K6b, V-K).
- **K4's obligations, now unblocked.** K4 implements R7 §5 in Rust, within its write set (`FK/structural/retained/**`), and adds:
  - directed wide rounding (every operation up, the one denominator down, per Lemmas D and E);
  - the shifted-pivot variant of the factor loop;
  - per-block bounds (Uc_c, S_c, B_c) over the free-free pattern's connected blocks;
  - W's contributions at q_W = min(3p + 64, 1024);
  - the charge C_q, the θ and g checks, W⁺, E, V, Φ, and the hybrid gate.
  - **Tests:**
    - E-UNIT, E-HEADROOM, E-ESTIMATE, E-CHARGE, E-UC and SD-G5;
    - controls: LEVER2 at three gains, TILT-LEVER, SEEDED-COMMON, SEEDED-SOFT, CHARGE-SLENDER, HH-FOOL-m, HH-SLENDER-m40 and THETA-STUB-COUPLED, and RF-LARGE at 10 and 100 members. **HH-SLENDER-m40 must not be expected to kill M24.**
    - mutants: those R7 §7 lists as killable, with the kept-for-derivation guards recorded as such.
  - K4's `retained/factor.rs` is the loop Lemmas D and E were read against. Any change to its pivot or rounding logic reopens those lemmas.

## K4: rulings on I12's A3-0 plan for revision 5a.3 (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

I12's plan (`IMPLEMENTATION/K4/PLAN_A3_5A3.md`, sha256 `07186550…`, 784 lines, committed on the K4 branch) is **approved**, with the rulings below.
- **The principle for every question:** where a choice bears on honesty, R7's text governs. Where it affects availability only, K4's practical form is accepted, and any difference from emu7 must be explained in RETURN.
- `factor.rs`'s `factor()`, `pivot_passes`, `negative_pair`, `solve_scaled` and `solve` stay byte-identical, which keeps Lemmas D and E tied to the loop as read.

**The questions:**
1. **Q1:** GEN is the bit oracle, and emu7 is the selection-level cross-check. Explain every difference.
2. **Q2:** ‖ā_q S‖₁'s stages are rounded upward, per R7 item 6. This bears on honesty, so R7 governs.
3. **Q3:** K4's est_c rounding (block sums rounded once, then a division) is accepted. It is availability only, and RETURN states that.
4. **Q4:** the read-only est_c observer in `condition` and the L and D read accessors are accepted as outside "pivot or rounding logic". A test pins `factor()`'s L and D bits unchanged.
5. **Q5:** the shifted loop is a separate operation-for-operation copy, bound by the loop-parity test and K4-M35.
6. **Q6:** best-state comparison is exact, with `ExactWideSum::add_product_of`, as recommended. A span overflow stops with `Span`, and that is recorded as an availability outcome.
7. **Q7:** use emu7's rejection order: (a), (b), `uc`, θ, g, then (d).
8. **Q8:** E rounding to +∞ gives a terminal `Unresolved(ResolutionScaleUnencodable)`, which F2a maps to `receipt_encoding`.
9. **Q9:** a body with no data block has no B_b entry and θ = 0. F2a and D2 confirm this at their slices; routed.
10. **Q10:** E-ESTIMATE's reference is GEN's exact rational solution.
11. **Q11:** E-HEADROOM uses the P state's own ê. At a verification it is the stop rule's E.
12. **Q12:** accepted, on one condition.
    - A support group's E is one exact sum over all contributors of its components, rounded once, in the direction R7 §3.1 prescribes for E.
    - RETURN must derive that this form meets every requirement R7's lemmas place on E for the group's published magnitude. It is not measured by emu7.
    - The reviewer checks the derivation. It is honesty-relevant, because ê sets both V and the allowances.
13. **Q13:** measure RF-LARGE-100's debug runtime at A3b. Any model over 60 s moves to an `--ignored` lane, with CHAIN-AX and TREE-AX kept in the default suite.
14. **Q14:** pin CEIL5A3 for K4-M24 only after GEN confirms that both operands are selected and the combination is Unresolved.
15. **Q15:** yes. Include the low-precision stress that kills M27.
16. **Q16:** `not_covered` stays empty in K4, since F2a owns the not-covered classes. Remove the pending marker at D.
17. **Q17:** d^b is formed lazily, only when the gate falls back. Work stays charged where it is incurred.
18. **Q18:** confirmed. The verification pass runs only on states used as verifications, the 2p state.

**Checkpoints:** A3a (the bounds and E, with no behaviour change), then A3b (the method and every control), then B, C and D.
- **Host:** as the plan states — one cargo job, `-j 4`, `RUST_TEST_THREADS=2`, and memguard checks.

## K6: rulings at C and D (ROOT, 2026-09-29; the C ruling was given in session and is recorded here)

- **C's stop:** K6-M4 (the watchdog kills the child only) and K6-M26 (the resume skip counts a not_run record as measured) survived the first pass.
  - ROOT approved I15's two tests, added to existing classes in `runner/test_k6_runner.py`: `LiveLimit.test_kills_take_the_whole_group` and `PlanAdmission.test_measured_runs_are_kept_and_not_run_records_are_run`.
  - After the re-runs, 26 of 26 are killed (K6 branch, `014b2ae04`).
- **D accepted:** committed on the K6 branch at `ae3320b5a`. Main `59cb20073` (F1b) is merged in at `3e90176c6`, and H's suite and test E pass there. No product byte changes (Scope 8).
  - **Disclosed:** the observation packet was written at D, not at B, within the write set, and it regenerates byte for byte from the committed records.
  - **Disclosed:** the provenance lock copy no longer matches `H/Cargo.lock`. Nothing reads it, and it is outside K6's write set.
  - **A limit:** the binary's time-budget and first-repeat stops were reached by no observation and have no dedicated test. The reviewer judges whether a test is needed before merge.
- **Next:** PR, an independent reviewer (RV18), hosted CI with the full-SHA dispatch, DEC-025 and GEN-8.

## K6: rulings on RV18's review (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **Verdict accepted:** PASS at `ae3320b5a`, with 0 BLOCKING, 4 SHOULD-FIX and 8 NOTEs (`REVIEW/K6_REVIEW.md`).
  - RV18 verified independently that no product byte changes, that test E is strict, and that the allocator's accounting and the refusals are right.
  - It found that the counts match its own port, the models match R1, and the packet and D's tables regenerate byte for byte.
- **All four SHOULD-FIX findings are fixed before merge,** each killing RV18's mutant from a clean archive:
  - **RV18-1:** a `k6_bin` test of the time-budget and first-repeat stops (RV18-M1, M2).
  - **RV18-2:** a `k6_bin` test that the summary's heap peak equals the maximum of the stage peaks, and that stage peaks restart (RV18-M3, M4).
  - **RV18-3:** the runner kills the observation process group in a `finally` and maps SIGTERM to a clean exit, with a no-survivor test for a SIGTERM to the runner mid-run.
  - **RV18-4:** scrub the four machine-path lines in `_run_records/c/logs/py-K6-M5.log`, and regenerate the K6 SHA256SUMS.
- **NOTEs fixed where cheap:**
  - N1–N3: tests for the poll interval (M6), home-path scrubbing (M7) and the DEC-025-sweep check (M8). Also scrub `time -v`'s output file on Linux.
  - N6: key CONT n10000's lane-id refusal on the canonical model's family and size, not its id, with a test.
  - N7: correct CHANGE_RECORD's base (`56dd72334`). Note in RETURN that run 137's `slot` reads B1 though it ran in B2, since raw records are not edited, and that the provenance lock copy was already stale on main.
  - N4, N5 and N8: recorded.
- **Next:** I15 fixes, then RV18 runs a delta check, followed by hosted CI with the dispatch, DEC-025 and GEN-8.

## K6 merged (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **Merged:** [PR1053](https://github.com/sgttomas/chirality/pull/1053) at head `cd325c1fe`, merge `7ac7b1c37`, 2026-09-29 09:52:09Z. The merge record is `IMPLEMENTATION/K6_MERGE/RECORD.md`.
- **The gates:**
  - RV18 PASSED, with its delta check PASSED;
  - hosted CI was green, and the dispatch (36548351414) succeeded;
  - GEN-8 passed;
  - DEC-025: K6's own tests are the only suite change, and pytest, vitest and the builds are clean.
- **operation_applier's 0-test result in the sweep** was a build failure in the shared sweep target: two `serde_json` versions, the mechanism not proven. It re-ran alone on the head with a fresh target and passed 194 of 194. ROOT removed the shared target.
  - **Procedure note for DEC-025:** start each sweep with a fresh target.
- **Next on the kernel path:**
  - K4 (A3b in progress);
  - then K6b (W1 observations) and V-K;
  - then ROOT's budget limits, F2a, and the owner's ceiling decision with V-P.

## K4: rulings at A3b (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **A3b accepted,** committed on the K4 branch at `bb7757ac5`.
  - Every control equals GEN's outcomes, and every selected control is honest and passes G5a.
  - RF-LARGE at 10 and 100 members is honest at 128.
  - E-CHARGE is bit-equal to GEN on 360 states.
  - `factor.rs` is unchanged since A3a.
- **Outcomes that moved from 5a.2 are accepted,** as the selected design's intended behaviour:
  1. **DIRECTIONAL-SPAN: 128 → Unresolved(Ceiling).** [Correction (I12 at B): 5a.2 selected it at **256**, not 128, so the change is 256 → Unresolved(Ceiling). 5a.2's publication was within b, checked against GEN's exact solution (worst ratio 1.5e-24; RETURN §22.3). It was not a false claim: 5a.3 withholds a correct publication, which is the availability loss accepted below.]
     - Its springs span R³ only through 2^-52 (κ ≈ 2^104). The solve's error stays above V/4 at every precision, so 5a.3 withholds it.
     - This is an availability loss, and it is honest.
     - **RETURN must state whether 5a.2's 128-bit publication was within b,** checked against GEN's exact solution. If it was not, it is a false claim that 5a.3 now withholds, and it is recorded as such.
     - DIRECTIONAL-WELL keeps the directional-spring recovery compared.
  2. **CEIL-A and CEIL-B → Unresolved(ResolutionScaleUnencodable).** E overflows under a 2^1013-rad rigid rotation (Q8). F-1's control moves to CEIL-S (P = 2^900, ε = 2^-160).
  3. **RIGID-UNLOADED: Unresolved → 512,** as R7 predicts.
- **The edge case, E finite while ê = fl(L_b·E_fo) overflows:** map it to `Unresolved(ResolutionScaleUnencodable)`, the same terminal reason as an E overflow, with a unit test. Do not escalate: an infinite V can never pass. Currently it ends as `Arithmetic(NonFinite)`, which is withheld and honest, but mislabelled.
- **Figures:** asserting at R7's two-figure rounding is accepted.
- **RETURN §22,** the Q12 support-group E derivation and the certified-bound conditions, is noted for the reviewer.
- **Next:**
  - **B:** FK, SD and NI suites; the 39-manifest suites on the Mac; K4 is kernel only, so T9 and the gate are not run (K4's brief).
  - **C:** mutants, including R7 §7's killable list and K4-M34 to M40.
  - **D:** records.

## K4: B accepted (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **B accepted.** It is committed on the K4 branch at `8a59458a1`, with main `7ac7b1c37` (K6) merged in at `8f8023a20` and no FK overlap.
  - The 39 manifests were run on main's piping source with K4's FK overlaid. Only frame_kernel changes: 267 → 389, K4's 122 tests. The only failures are the three known Mac ones.
  - FK 389, SD 30 and NI 134 pass.
  - The path and dependency scan shows no product path reaches K4's code: everything is `pub(crate)` inside a private `mod retained`. So T9 and the gate are not run.
- **Both A3b additions are done:**
  - DIRECTIONAL-SPAN's 5a.2 publication is shown within b, with a test;
  - the ê-overflow edge case maps to `ResolutionScaleUnencodable`, with a unit test and a new control, EHAT-OVERFLOW.
- **Next:** C (mutants), then D (records), then review.

## K4: C accepted; the honesty predicate tightened at D (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **C accepted.**
  - Every killable mutant is killed: R7 §7's list, K4-M34 to M40, and K4's earlier mutants and D-series.
  - K4-M24's CEIL5A3 kill is confirmed.
  - The four derivation guards (R7-M17, M21, M24, and M27 at design precision) move no control. As R7 expects, each is caught at evidence or unit level.
  - The NONE controls pass.
- **I12's note 4: tighten the honesty predicate at D.**
  - The controls' `compare_honest` accepts 1e-9 relative, or the absolute bound for absolute-verified rows. That is far looser than the published claim, so some mutants' false claims show only as selection changes.
  - At D, `compare_honest` checks each selected row against the claim it publishes: its exact bound, with the binary64 publication rounding stated, where the row carries one; otherwise the stop rule's relative bound, plus the publication rounding.
  - Then re-run the controls test, and the evidence pass for R7-M1, K4-M24 and K4-M37. Record which of their false claims are now caught as dishonest.
  - If a selected unmutated control fails the tightened check, that is a **stop**: an honesty finding.
- **Notes 1–3 are recorded:**
  - REACTIONS-ONLY stays at 256 under R7-M3 in K4;
  - K4-M12 and D13 are killed at bit level only, since the corrections repair the fold;
  - K4-M30 now describes the design, and its inverse, K4-M30i, is killed.
- **Next:** D.

## K4: D accepted; to review (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **D accepted.** ROOT committed it for I12 on the K4 branch at `7d8fa9c0e`; I12 made no Git write.
  - ROOT checked the five files' sha256 against I12's return, the `_run_records/` `SHA256SUMS` (214 files; its own sha256 `f79cfe57…`), rustfmt on the three test files, and a scan of the records for machine paths and model identifiers. All pass.
- **The tightened predicate meets the C ruling.** `compare_honest` checks each selected row against the claim it publishes, with the binary64 rounding stated (RETURN §22.9). No selected unmutated control fails it: 99 controls and 5,490 rows, the worst at 0.28 of its allowance; the recovery test's 43 models pass. So there is no stop.
- **The evidence pass is recorded as returned:** F-2-SPOS (R7-M1) and CEIL5A3 (K4-M24) are newly caught as dishonest; all eight K4-M37 moves are caught.
- **PRESCRIBED-TAIL and PRESCRIBED-TAIL-FREE under R7-M1: accepted as a limit of the test's binary64 expectations,** not of the method.
  - The false b = 0 at 128 is real, as R7 counts it. Its truth, 2^-1091 N, lies below binary64's smallest subnormal, so a binary64 expectation cannot show the claim failing.
  - The mutant is killed regardless, by its selection changes; unmutated, the case is selected at 512 and its floored b covers the truth.
  - **Routed to the T3-close list:** expectation files that mark an exact value as nonzero (an underflow marker), so that a false b = 0 on such a row is caught directly. V-K may carry it.
- **I12's two new arguments go to the reviewer; ROOT adopts neither as design text.**
  1. **§6 item 4:** that θ ≤ 1/2 with the certified B forces a data-carrying block's K\* to be nonsingular, by Lemma C's Neumann step. This is I12's reading of R7's proof, not a sentence R7 states. The honesty guarantee does not rest on it: the no-data-block residue stays under R7's standing premise, "K\* nonsingular per body".
  2. **§9 step 12:** route 1's constant under the bounded majorant, ‖Ā‖₁ ≤ 9·g_max·‖|K|_contrib‖₁, derived in the unscaled 1-norm and argued in the equilibrated norm. It is availability, not honesty, and no 1024 verification on the controls uses the bounded gate. It is recorded as one of K4's limits (RETURN §19).
- **Next:**
  - the PR, with hosted CI and the full-SHA dispatch;
  - an independent reviewer (RV19), directed to RETURN §22.1, §22.2, §9 steps 10 to 12, §6 item 4 and §22.9;
  - then DEC-025 with a fresh target, GEN-8, the merge and the merge record.

## K4: rulings on RV19's review (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

RV19 (`REVIEW/K4_REVIEW.md`, sha256 `d906539e…`; records `REVIEW/_run_records/k4_review/`, 47 files and `SHA256SUMS` `8b8e2beb…`) reviewed head `7d8fa9c0e`: **FAIL**, with 1 BLOCKING, 5 SHOULD-FIX and 7 NOTEs. ROOT checked RV19's records (`SHA256SUMS` passes; no machine paths) and read RV19-1's code at `adaptive.rs:1496-1544` and `:2159-2176`.

- **RV19-1 (BLOCKING) is confirmed. Fix it before merge.**
  - `scales_at`, the stop rule's S\*, skips only input-derived rows, so a row the candidate cannot publish (binary64 overflow or underflow) still enters S\*_2p. `classify_rows_floored` excludes such rows from S\*_pub, as O9 requires. The two scales can then differ by any factor, and R7 §5.2's premise, that S\*_pub is within a relative 2^-64 + 2^-52 of S\*_2p, fails. OVF-ROT-928 publishes Rz = −2^901 as `relative_verified` against an exact 0.
  - **The fix:** apply O9 to the stop rule. `scales_at` skips every row whose candidate value has no binary64 value, so both scales are formed from the same rows. This only removes rows from S\*, which makes the stop rule stricter. It changes availability, never honesty. I12 checks every other user of `scales_at` and states the argument in RETURN.
  - **Add OVF-ROT-928 as a control**, in GEN and `outcomes.txt`. Add the reverted fix as a mutant killed by it. OVF-ROT-900 stays honest and unchanged.
  - RV19's probe of this fix moved no control. I12 confirms that on the full suite, the N5 streams included.
- **RV19-6 is ruled as a design defect that K4 fixes now: D1 revision 5a.3, amendment A1.** A selected row outside its claim is BLOCKING by K4's brief, whatever its cause.
  - **The defect.** D1 §4.1.6's revision-4 rule classes every row `absolute_verified` once S\* < 2^-988, with b = fl↑(2^-64·S\*). R7 §5.2's published-value bound, |q_pub − q\*| ≤ b·(1 + 2^-22), assumes |q| < 2^-34·S\*, which that rule does not give. The binary64 rounding of a row near S\* is then up to 2^11·b. TINY-S-995 misses its claim on seven rows, by 222 to 819 times.
  - **The amendment.** Where 0 < S\* < 2^-988, each `absolute_verified` row carries its own bound, which includes its publication rounding:
    - b_row = fl↑(fl↑(2^-64·S\*) + fl↑(2^-53·|q_pub|) + 2^-1074).
    - **Derivation:** |q_pub − q\*| ≤ |q_pub − q_p| + |q_p − q\*|. Rounding to nearest gives |q_pub − q_p| ≤ 2^-53·|q_pub| + 2^-1075. The accepted candidate gives |q_p − q\*| ≤ 2^-64·S\* within the factor R7 §5.2 already carries. So |q_pub − q\*| ≤ b_row·(1 + 2^-22), or 2^-21 at 512.
    - **Why only there.** Where S\* ≥ 2^-988, an absolute row has |q| < 2^-34·S\*, and its rounding is below 2^-23·b, as R7 §5.2 argues. So b is unchanged there, and b = 0 is unchanged at S\* = 0.
    - **Relative rows** cannot occur where S\* < 2^-988, and where S\* ≥ 2^-988 they are normal numbers. So their claim is unchanged.
  - **K4 implements the amendment.** GEN follows it. TINY-S-995 becomes a control, with an expectation precise enough that the unamended code fails it: a mutant reverting the amendment must be killed. Any control whose bound bits change is listed.
  - **Routed:** D2's G5 checks b_row (D2's input list). RV19 checks the derivation and the implementation at its delta check. ROOT adopts the amendment into the design text as a ruling, because `DESIGN.md` stays hash-pinned.
- **RV19-2 (SHOULD-FIX): fix it in K4.**
  - `compare_honest` fails, instead of skipping, when a published row with a value has no expectation.
  - An `Underflow` or `Overflow` row is checked against its exact value's range. **The expectation files carry a range marker** for exact values outside binary64's range: underflow (with the sign) or overflow. This is the marker ROOT routed at D, now done in K4. It is removed from the T3-close list. With it, R7-M1's false b = 0 on PRESCRIBED-TAIL and PRESCRIBED-TAIL-FREE should be caught directly; record whether it is.
  - **The 13 selected controls without expectations** get GEN's exact expectations where GEN can compute them (HH-FOOL, HH-SLENDER-m40, N03-RX, R115-SEED3 and RF-LARGE at 10 members). Any that cannot are named, with the reason.
  - **RF-LARGE at 100 members:** run G5a on the six frames, and `compare_honest` where exact expectations are practical. Otherwise correct RETURN §12.6, §22.8 and CHANGE_RECORD to say exactly what is checked.
  - Every statement of the form "every selected control" must match what the tests check.
- **RV19-3 (SHOULD-FIX): fix it in K4.** `RetainedCombination::solve` refuses operands whose stations or support groups differ, with a `CombinationReason`, and a test (RV19's t = 0.25 against 0.75 case).
- **RV19-4 (SHOULD-FIX): fix it in K4.** Add a control with a support group carrying a directional spring, so that RV19-M6 is killed.
- **RV19-5 (SHOULD-FIX): fix it in K4.** Add a unit test that pins ‖SĀS‖ as the larger of the 1-norm and the ∞-norm, killing RV19-M2.
- **§6 item 4: confirmed by RV19.** ROOT adopts it as a ruling. θ_c ≤ 1/2 with the certified B_c makes a data-carrying block's K\*_c nonsingular, by Lemma C's Neumann step, under Lemma B's standing premise. A block with no data stays under R7's premise, "K\* nonsingular per body".
- **The NOTEs:**
  - N1 and N2 are corrected in RETURN.
  - N6: the tests' `powi` is replaced by exact constants.
  - N4 (the release-mode `break` in `wide_sum`): make it a returned error, if that is small; otherwise record it.
  - N3, N5 and N7 are recorded; strengthening them is optional.
- **After the fixes:**
  - re-run FK's full suite and K4's suite, with the controls token-equal to GEN (with the new controls);
  - `gen_k4_vectors.py --check`;
  - the mutants the fixes touch, and the new ones: the reverted RV19-1 fix, the reverted amendment, RV19-M2 and RV19-M6;
  - the evidence pass for R7-M1, K4-M24 and K4-M37 under the new checks;
  - then RETURN addendum 1 and the records. RV19 checks the delta.

## K4: rulings on RV19's delta check at a5fa0eaf7 (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **RV19's delta check PASSES:** 0 BLOCKING, 1 SHOULD-FIX and 4 NOTEs (`REVIEW/K4_REVIEW.md`, "Delta check at a5fa0eaf7", sha256 `319701f6…`; records `REVIEW/_run_records/k4_review/delta/`, with `SHA256SUMS` now covering 80 files, `ab9f24d8…`).
  - RV19-1 is closed on both the overflow and the underflow side.
  - Amendment A1 is independently re-derived and implemented as ruled. Only PT-B's and PTF-B's bounds change, and TINY-S-995 kills the reverted amendment.
  - RV19's oracle finds every selected publication honest: 120 publications (8,272 rows) and the six 100-member frames (15,378 rows).
- **The gates on `a5fa0eaf7` are green:**
  - hosted CI: runs 36584733672, 36584733559, 36584733590 and 36584733821;
  - the full-SHA dispatch 36584771469 (target_base `7ac7b1c37`);
  - DEC-025, clean;
  - GEN-8.
  - Since the head changes for RV19-D4, all of them re-run on the final head.
- **RV19-D4 (SHOULD-FIX): fix it before merge.** It is a test gap, but on the fix of a BLOCKING honesty finding. Add an SD-G5-style vector on `decide` in which the candidate overflows and the verification does not, and the underflow pair. Assert that such a row sets no S\*. Show RV19's mutant RV19-D4 killed.
- **DN2:** RETURN's "every selected … combination" must match what is tested. Either give PRECISION-RULE expectations and run it, or correct the wording.
- **DN1, DN3 and DN4 are recorded.** They affect no check.

## K4 merged (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **Merged:** [PR1054](https://github.com/sgttomas/chirality/pull/1054) at head `5a46a6278`, merge `ab02ee3a6`, 2026-09-29 16:25:25Z. The merge record is `IMPLEMENTATION/K4_MERGE/RECORD.md`.
- **The gates:**
  - RV19 FAILED the first head on RV19-1, a false publication. It PASSED the fixes on its delta check and confirmed the final head with no findings;
  - hosted CI was green, and the dispatch (36593106169) succeeded. The numerical job took 18.3 to 20.1 min;
  - GEN-8 passed;
  - DEC-025, with a fresh sweep target: K4's own tests are the only suite change, and pytest, vitest and the builds are clean.
- **D1 revision 5a.3 now includes amendment A1** (the per-row b where 0 < S\* < 2^-988), by ROOT's ruling on RV19-6. `DESIGN.md` stays hash-pinned.
- **Procedure note for DEC-025:** remove the canonical sweep summary from the sweep worktree after copying it. A leftover summary makes the next sweep see a dirty tree.
- **Next on the kernel path:**
  - K6b (I16) and V-K (I17), from main `ab02ee3a6`. K6b's A0 adds the `retained` export, and V-K reuses that commit;
  - then ROOT's W1 limits, F2a, and the owner's ceiling decision with V-P.

## K6b and V-K: spawn (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **K6b is spawned as I16** (`TASK_BRIEFS/I16_K6B_IMPLEMENTATION.md`), on branch `codex/piping-k6b-20260929` in `<wt>/k6b`, from main `ab02ee3a6` (K4 merged).
- **V-K is spawned as I17** (`TASK_BRIEFS/I17_VK_IMPLEMENTATION.md`), on branch `codex/piping-vk-20260929` in `<wt>/vk`, from the same main. ROOT cherry-picks K6b's A0 export commit onto it once that commit exists.
- **The briefs cite K4 at `7d8fa9c0e`.** The merged head is `5a46a6278`. RETURN §16's export list is unchanged by the review fixes, apart from `CombinationReason::OperandsDiffer` (RV19-3). Re-locate every line on main.
- **Checkpoint 0 is read and design only** for both. There is no build until ROOT approves each plan.

## V-K: rulings on I17's checkpoint-0 plan (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

The plan is `IMPLEMENTATION/VK/PLAN_CHECKPOINT0.md` on the V-K branch (sha256 `adaf697a…`; committed by ROOT). **It is approved, with these rulings.**

- **Q1:** V-P adds `product_physics`; V-K does not.
- **Q2:** the generated, committed cases file with R1's sha256 pinned and `--check`, is approved.
  - Expected values are R1's decimal strings, byte for byte.
  - Comparisons are decided exactly by an in-crate big-integer engine, with no registry dependency. The engine gets its own unit tests, including against Python's `fractions` on sampled rows, and the reviewer checks it.
  - The 1,000- and 10,000-member models are generated on demand, with their sha256 committed.
- **Q3:** CI runs every case up to 100 members. RF-LARGE at 1,000 and 10,000 members run as examples. Report VR's measured CI time at A1; more than 3 min added is reported.
- **Q4:** the 14 seeded faults are approved.
  - VK-F06, VK-F07 and VK-R28 may be killed on evidence: the outcome, attempts and selected precision against V-K's committed per-case records. These are returned evidence, which F2a publishes (O5's condition).
  - VK-F17's extra check is approved: every `not_covered` comparison's row must be `absolute_verified`.
  - **The selector** (`K4R/seeded.rs`, cfg-gated, reading `FK_SEEDED_FAULT` once) and its cfg-gated `mod` line count as fault sites. An unknown id panics.
  - With the feature off and outside `cfg(test)`, the code is absent. FK's own test build must be unchanged in effect: FK's suite passes with the variable unset.
- **Q5:** approved. V-K runs its own models, one release process each, under K6's runner, with the heap cap at C − 512 MiB.
  - The ascent is 100 → 1,000 → 10,000. 10,000 members run only as ROOT approves, and after K6b's timed runs.
  - A 30-minute slot per tier. V-K's scale runs record the outcome, work and time with its load, and are not a timing claim; timing is K6b's.
- **Q6 and Q7:** approved.
  - The one-off bit comparison against K4's `r1_cases.txt` and `r1_large.txt` is recorded. Every difference must be one of the plan's §4.4 list, explained.
  - Bit identity is asserted for list permutations only.
- **Q8 (the export) binds K6b's A0 as well, and extends it.** RETURN §16's list names types, but a consumer outside FK also needs:
  - the fields of the plain-data input types, to build a source: `SourceParts`, `StraightMember`, `Spring`, `DirectionalSpring`, `Constraint`, `NodalLoad`, `Station`, `SupportGroup` and `Dof`;
  - the fields of the output and evidence records, to read them: `Publication`, `PublishedRow`, `RetainedEvidence`, `AttemptRecord`, `StageWork`, `StorageCounts` and the other evidence types in the list;
  - the methods `Binary64Outcome::value`, `Component::{index, from_index, ALL}` and `Dof::{global, from_global}`.
  - **Types whose invariants matter keep private fields and public accessors:** `PrimitiveSource` (built only through `new`), `RetainedSolve`, `PrecisionState`, `CaseLimit` and `InvocationMeter`.
  - **I16 implements A0 and I17 confirms it covers V-K's needs** before ROOT commits A0. The exact list is recorded in A0's commit message and in both RETURNs.
  - Nothing that lets a caller supply a matrix, factor, closure or label becomes public.
- **The conflicts:**
  - **C1 (RF-RANGE twist and extension):** the exact power-of-two pre-scaling is approved. It must give bits identical to §4.10's formula wherever that formula's k_t and k_a are finite and normal, and a test asserts this on every such case. Record the derivation.
  - **C2:** approved as planned. §7.3 items 5, 16, 3 and the relabelling half of 10 are not seeded in V-K, and V-K adds no cases outside R1. For each, cite K4's killing control from K4's mutation table, or record it as undiscriminated by R1.
  - **C3:** the kill on evidence for §7.3 item 7 is approved; the design's "recovered" is recorded as inexact.
  - **C4:** the parity items are §4.8 items 1–3, at up to 100 members.
  - **C5:** confirmed. V-K's scale runs use R1's own rounding and are separate from K6b's.
  - **C7:** approved. No site goes in the byte-identical `factor.rs` functions or in `bound.rs`'s shift loop. The scans run before any site is written, and a flagged site is a stop.
  - **C8:** `hypot` is decided exactly.
  - **C9:** compute it both ways and report.
  - **C10:** a k = 0 spring refused by K4's source counts as RF-MECH's refusal only if the refusal names it (the `SourceError`). Record it.
  - C11 and C12 are recorded.
- **Next:**
  - A1 without the export, now: the generator, the cases file, the exact engine and the parts of VR that do not call `retained`. One cargo job at `-j 4`.
  - A1's kernel lane waits for A0. ROOT cherry-picks A0 onto the V-K branch once it is committed on K6b's.

## K6b: rulings on I16's checkpoint-0 plan, and A0's export (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

The plan is `IMPLEMENTATION/K6B/PLAN_CHECKPOINT0.md` on the K6b branch (sha256 `7d6b7af3…`; committed by ROOT at `c0436769f`). **It is approved, with these rulings.**

- **C-1 (the flat `pub use` does not compile): the facade module is approved.** Declare `pub mod retained_api { pub use super::retained::…; }` in `FK/structural.rs`, right after the private `mod retained;`. K4's names stay as they are (`adaptive::POLICY` included), nothing new enters `structural`'s namespace, and the product scan is one grep for `retained_api`.
- **C-2 (`PrecisionState` exposes the private `Solved`):** `PrecisionState` and `RetainedSolve::state` stay crate-private. No `#[allow(private_interfaces)]`. Neither K6b nor V-K uses them. If F2a needs the retained-state digest (§4.1.8), it asks for an accessor that exposes no private type.
- **What A0 exports** is RETURN §16's list, as extended by "V-K: rulings on I17's checkpoint-0 plan" Q8:
  - the fields of the plain-data input types and of the output and evidence records;
  - the methods `Binary64Outcome::value`, `Component::{index, from_index, ALL}` and `Dof::{global, from_global}`;
  - `Binary64Outcome`'s variants, which become public with the enum;
  - the fields of `AttemptWork`, `WidthWork` and `SumWork` only if V-K or K6b reads them. I17 says whether V-K needs them.
  - **Types whose invariants matter keep private fields:** `PrimitiveSource`, `RetainedSolve`, `CaseLimit` and `InvocationMeter`.
  - Nothing that lets a caller supply a matrix, factor, closure or label becomes public.
  - Remove the `#[allow(dead_code)] // F2a API` markers on items that are now public.
  - **Before ROOT commits A0, I17 confirms it covers V-K's needs.** The final count of items, methods and fields goes in A0's commit message and in both RETURNs.
- **Q1:** approved: option (a), per-precision memory from budget-truncated prefix calls through the public API, with the overshoot derived. The 512 and 1024 increments stay derived; no escalating invented model.
- **Q2:** approved: the mode is `w1a`, with a new JSONL kind `attempt`. "Reused unchanged" means K6's existing kinds keep their schema; adding a kind is allowed.
- **Q3:** the four tiers are approved.
  - `CaseLimit` and `InvocationMeter` are both `u64::MAX`, recorded in each run's start line; a budget outcome is a stop.
  - W1-T4 (10,000 members) runs only as ROOT approves, after W1-T3 has measured ρ.
  - **W1 counts-only runs at 1,000 and 10,000 members during A2 are approved** (O(nnz), no solve, a 512 MiB cap), as for K6's N7.
- **Q4 to Q7:** approved as planned.
  - K6's tiers keep a frozen four-mode tuple, so K6's 138 rows are unchanged.
  - K6b's row checks at R1's 1e-9 are not the honesty check (that is K4's and V-K's); a failure is still a stop.
- **R1's rows in H's CI test:** `include_str!` of `K4T/r1_large.txt` is approved. The test asserts that file's sha256, so a change to it is visible.
- **The brief-to-code conflicts are recorded:**
  - K6's profile counts cannot stand for W1's storage;
  - a wide value takes 8L + 16 bytes;
  - RF-LARGE's memory is dominated by the per-member operators;
  - swapping Iy and Iz is equivalent here;
  - `solve_cases` gets an equality test only.
- **Next:** A0 now. Report it as soon as it compiles and FK's suite passes; one cargo job at `-j 4`. I17 works on V-K's parts that do not call `retained`.

## K6b A0 accepted; the export is on both branches (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **A0 is accepted.** ROOT committed it in two commits on the K6b branch:
  - `bb89e4f8f`: FK's `retained_api` export. It is visibility only: 240 `pub(crate)` → `pub` edits, 20 dead-code markers removed, and the facade block. It covers 72 items, 38 methods and 130 fields.
  - `fdbf132d4`: H's test that the export suffices from outside FK.
- **ROOT's checks:**
  - every removed line in FK's diff is a `pub(crate)` or a dead-code marker, and every added line is `pub` or the facade;
  - the eleven files' sha256 equal I16's return;
  - I16 reports FK's full suite at 394 passed, 0 warnings, and rustfmt clean;
  - `retained_api` is named only by `FK/structural.rs` and H's test.
- **I17 confirmed the export covers V-K.** `Kind::{ALL, index}` stay crate-private.
- **The export commit alone is cherry-picked onto the V-K branch** as `3018343c2`, with the same patch-id as `bb89e4f8f`. H's test stays on K6b.
  - Whichever PR merges first carries the export to main. The other merges main, and the identical change merges cleanly.
- **Next:** K6b's A1 (the W1 mode and the adapter), and V-K's A1 kernel lane. Each uses one cargo job.

## V-K: rulings on I17's A1 stop (THIN-A and THIN-B) (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **The stop.** RF-RANGE-THIN-A and THIN-B (R1's PHYS-R4 geometry: OD 4e-77 m, L = 1 m) end `Unresolved(Ceiling)` through W1a.
  - The attempts: 128 is rejected by the stop rule, 256 by the stop rule, 512 by the charge test (d), and 1024 verifies with nothing above it.
  - EA/(12EI/L³) ≈ 6.7e152, about 2^507, so no candidate at 512 bits or below can reach the stop rule's 2^-64 accuracy.
  - K4 publishes nothing: the result is honest, but unavailable. V-K's adapter is not the cause, as I17's probe with K4's y_reference shows. Every other of V-K's 201 CI cases passes as projected.
- **Ruling, subject to one confirmation. I17 first runs K4's generator (`K4T/gen_k4_vectors.py`, K4's bit oracle for the design) on THIN-A and THIN-B.** GEN must give the same attempt chain and outcome. If it does, this is the design's limit, not a K4 defect. If it does not, it is a K4 finding and a stop.
- **Given that confirmation, THIN-A and THIN-B are W1a's coverage limit,** and VP-ROBUST's kernel-lane gate (§4.10) is amended as follows:
  - V-K commits an **expected-unresolved list**, THIN-A and THIN-B with their reason, pinned like the `not_covered` list.
  - Those cases must end honestly unresolved, with no rows published.
  - Their comparisons are never counted as passes. They are reported as a separate count.
  - A case that leaves or joins the list blocks the gate until ROOT reviews it.
  - Every other case keeps §4.10's rule: an unsolved case fails.
- **Why this is acceptable:**
  - It is not a product regression. On the ordinary route, W2's scaling solves the PHYS-R4 geometry (K2b's rulings: "PHYS-R4 (b = 536) … solved and accurate").
  - W1 is selected only for Sensitive and D-5-routed cases.
  - W1's ladder tops out at a 512-bit candidate by design (R7). An intrinsic stiffness spread near 2^507 is beyond it, and W1a withholds honestly.
- **Routed:**
  - **To F2a and V-P:** THIN's product standing on the ordinary route, and what F2a publishes if such a case is routed to W1 and W1 ends unresolved.
  - **To the owner's PHYS-R4 decision** (F1b's rulings): this fact is added to it.
  - **To D1 and the T3-close list:** whether W1 should reach beyond 512 (a 1024 candidate with a 2048 verification) or treat decoupled stiffness spreads separately. It is not needed now.
- **The three input-derived rows** (`RF-WEAK-W-AX-rho1e-12` `u.N5.UX/UY/UZ`, at a restrained node): I17's reading is confirmed. Rule 2a makes rows at restrained DOFs `input_derived`, exact prescriptions. So they are exempt from the "`not_covered` implies `absolute_verified`" check, pinned to those three.
- **§7.3 item 5 (no escalation)** is now killable on THIN's attempt evidence. Add it to the seeded faults at A2 (VK-F05).
- **Next, for I17:**
  - the GEN confirmation;
  - the expected-unresolved list and its test;
  - A1's remaining items: §5.3's parity at up to 100 members, and Q7's recorded observations;
  - then return A1.

## K6b: A1 accepted; K4's stop-rule memory finding (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **A1 is accepted.** ROOT committed it at `73031b134` on the K6b branch, with 18 files in H.
  - ROOT checked the new files' sha256 against I16's return, that FK has no change beyond A0, and that no machine paths appear.
  - The results:
    - the `w1a` mode, with `attempt` and `prefix` records; the new kind `prefix` is allowed;
    - the adapter's K4SRC bytes equal an independent Python writer's on 24 of 24 RF-LARGE models;
    - the six frames at 10 and 100 members are selected at 128, and R1's predicate passes on every row;
    - H's debug suite grows 65.3 s → 78.8 s.
- **The finding (confirmed by ROOT at `K4R/adaptive.rs:533-590`):**
  - K4's `ExtremeTracker` keeps every row whose 64-bit ratio approximation lies within `WINDOW_ULPS` (2^13) of the running extreme, each as two `ExactWideSum` values, about 4.3 KB, and keeps them until `decide` returns.
  - So the stop rule's memory depends on the data: nearly every row when many ratios tie.
  - At 100 members it adds 0.3–4.9 MB. The worst case at 10,000 members is about 3.2 GB (6.4 GB with `Vec` slack).
  - **It affects no published value.** It matters for W1's per-case memory limit and for admission.
- **Rulings:**
  - **E_max keeps the worst-case tracker term.** Admission uses the upper bound derived from the code, with ρ measured.
  - W1-T4 (10,000 members) runs only as ROOT approves, after W1-T3's prefixes at 1,000 members show how the kept count grows. The plan's W1-T4 row is superseded.
  - **Routed: a kernel follow-up (KF1) bounds the tracker without changing any result.** For example, collapse the kept entries to their exact extreme when their count passes a threshold. It needs its own review; K4's golden work counts would change.
    - It is paired with K6's N10 (bounding the dense witness) as the kernel follow-up slice.
    - **ROOT's W1 memory limit is not set until KF1 lands, or until the limit accounts for the worst case explicitly.**
- **Next:** A2: the runner's W1 tiers, `--plan`, `--smoke`, the approved counts-only runs at 1,000 and 10,000 members (no solve, 512 MiB cap) and the release projection. No W1 solve above 100 members before ROOT approves the schedule.

## K6b: A2 accepted; W1-T1 to W1-T3 approved (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **A2 is accepted.** ROOT committed it at `f4d40dd17` on the K6b branch. ROOT checked the four files' sha256 against I16's return and found no machine paths.
  - K6's four modes are frozen, and its 138 rows are unchanged, checked field by field.
  - The W1 tiers add 132 interleaved rows.
  - The runner suite passes 44 of 44, and the wrapper with the DEC-050/053 pins 46 of 46.
  - The counts-only runs cover every sealed model at up to 10,000 members, with a heap of at most 197 MB under the 512 MiB cap.
  - The smoke selected all 21 models at 128, with 0 parity failures.
- **The schedule is approved** (`plan.txt`, sha256 `091ee187…`), with B's binary built in release from a `git archive` of `f4d40dd17`:
  - **W1-T1 and W1-T2 in slot K6B-S1, and W1-T3 in slot K6B-S2,** with pass-1 prefixes at 1,000 members. One observation process at a time, the quiet-host wait, the load recorded per run, and the memory guard running.
  - **W1-T4 stays deferred.** ROOT rules on it from W1-T3's measured prefixes and tracker figures, and from KF1's status.
  - A watchdog kill, a heap-cap abort, a budget outcome or a parity failure on an admitted run is a stop.
- **The slot:** ROOT grants K6B-S1 and K6B-S2 now. I17 holds cargo and heavy Python until I16 reports B's runs done.
  - An unrelated long-running external process (one core, outside this repository) keeps the load near 5. It is recorded, not waited out. Timings are observations with their load.

## KF1: spawn (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **KF1 (the stop-rule tracker bound) is spawned as I18** (`TASK_BRIEFS/I18_KF1_IMPLEMENTATION.md`), on branch `codex/piping-kf1-20260929` in `<wt>/kf1`, from main `ab02ee3a6`. [Correction: the branch was created at main `8cca91701`, PR #1055, which changes only `projects/chirality-app-v4/**`. The piping tree is the same.]
- **Checkpoint 0 is a plan only.** Builds wait until K6b's timed slot ends.
- **K6's N10** (bounding the dense witness, and examining the dense screen's operation count) is split out as **KF2**. It is product-reaching, so its gate is heavier, and it is briefed separately. It does not block W1's limits.
- **Order for W1's memory limit:** KF1 merges. Then K6b merges main and measures W1-T4 (10,000 members) on the bounded tracker, subject to ROOT's W1-T4 ruling.

## K6b: B's W1-T1 to W1-T3 accepted; W1-T4 approved before KF1 (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **W1-T1 to W1-T3 are accepted.** I16 ran 108 processes, all ok, with no stop (records in `<wt>/scratch/i16/b/`, which move to `_run_records/` at D).
  - All 42 W1 processes selected 128 and verified at 256, with every parity item true.
  - R1's unchanged predicate passes on all 10,078 comparisons, decided exactly. The worst is 1.75e-6 of the allowance.
  - At 1,000 members: 0.56–1.58 s per call, 0.80–1.41 ns per limb-multiply equivalent, and 86–117 MiB of heap. W1 takes 6.8–14.2 times the binary64 sparse entry's time.
  - The stop rule costs 9–21% of the call. 5a.3's shift costs one shifted factorization, except on CONT-AX, which needs none.
  - Heap grows with a log-log slope of 0.96–0.99.
- **The tracker measured at 1,000 members** keeps 0–8,773 entries, at most 5.5% of its worst-case term. The kept fraction of rows does not grow with size (CONT 0.39, 0.43, 0.33 at 10, 100 and 1,000 members).
- **W1-T4 (10,000 members) is approved now, in its own slot K6B-S3,** as scheduled: 5 repeats, prefixes in pass 1. This supersedes the order in "KF1: spawn".
  - **Why before KF1:** it measures the unbounded tracker's actual size on RF-LARGE at 10,000 members, which KF1's review and ROOT's memory limit need.
  - **Why it is safe:** the heap cap (7.5 GiB) is below E_max (8.6–8.9 GiB), so a worst-case tracker would end in a heap-cap abort, not strain the host. The admission rule, with ρ measured at 100 members or more (0.17–0.27), admits every row.
  - A heap-cap abort here is recorded as a finding for KF1, not a stop of K6b.
  - Any other stop condition still stops.
- **After KF1 merges,** ROOT decides whether K6b re-measures a subset on the bounded tracker, for the stop rule's changed work, before the W1 limits are set.

## V-K: THIN confirmed by GEN; the expected-unresolved list stands (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **GEN confirms THIN.** K4's generator, run on THIN-A and THIN-B with its own adapter `r1_adapt` and G = E/(2(1 + ν)) stated exactly, gives K4's chain exactly:
  - 128 rejected by the stop rule at row 7;
  - 256 rejected by the stop rule at row 14;
  - 512 rejected by the charge at row 14;
  - Ceiling.
  - The record is `IMPLEMENTATION/VK/_run_records/a1/gen_thin_confirm.*`.
- **So THIN is W1a's design limit,** and the ruling "V-K: rulings on I17's A1 stop" takes effect. The expected-unresolved list is `VR/cases/expected_unresolved.json`: THIN-A and THIN-B, with log2 of the stiffness spread 507.67.
- **RF-RANGE** gives 2,590 passes, 80 structural zeros, 50 expected unresolved and 0 failures.
- **Also recorded from I17's A1 work:**
  - §5.3's parity: K is bitwise equal between the sparse and dense paths, and the outcome class is the same, on RF-LARGE at up to 100 members and on RF-MECH.
  - Q7's invariance observations: offsets are bit-identical, and relabelled variants differ only by the roundings that follow RCM's order.
- **I17 resumes** its debug suite and returns A1 when K6b's slot K6B-S3 ends.

## K6b: W1-T4 stopped by the binary's backstop; deferred until KF1 (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **What happened.** Row 247 (CHAIN-n10000-AX, `w1a`, pass 1) was admitted by the runner, on E_max × measured ρ ≈ 1.7 GB. The binary then refused it, `estimate_exceeds_half_cap`: K6's backstop (`main.rs:658`) compares the raw E_max, 9.23 GB, with half the heap cap, 3.75 GiB.
  - There was no solve: the heap peak was 3.9 MB. Nothing else in W1-T4 ran, and the memory guard logged no kill.
  - "The binary refused a run the runner admitted" is a runner stop, and I16 stopped correctly.
  - **The backstop worked as designed.** The miss, I16's own, was that A2 tested the runner's admission but not the backstop, for a mode whose ρ is far below 1.
- **Ruling: option (c). W1-T4 stays deferred until KF1 merges.**
  - The binary's backstop stays independent of the runner. Option (a), passing the runner's figure to the binary, would make the backstop trust the runner, which defeats it.
  - Option (b), dropping the tracker term for `w1a` only, is superseded by KF1: once KF1 bounds the tracker, E_max falls to about 2.6 GiB and passes the backstop unchanged.
  - The unbounded tracker's size at 10,000 members is no longer needed. W1-T3 measured it at 1,000 members (at most 5.5% of the worst case, with the kept fraction not growing with size), which is enough to motivate KF1. W1-T4 should measure the bounded code, which is what will ship and what the limits need.
- **Then:**
  - K6b's branch merges main after KF1.
  - K6b re-runs W1-T3 (about 3 minutes; KF1 changes the stop rule's work) and runs W1-T4, on a binary rebuilt from that commit, in slots ROOT grants.
  - Row 247's refused record is voided (renamed, with the reason), as K6 did.
- **K6b proceeds now to C (mutants),** one cargo job. D waits for W1-T4.
- **A new mutant for C:** the runner's admission is checked against the binary's backstop. A test asserts that, for every admitted row, the binary's own check admits it too, or the row is deferred by name. This closes I16's miss.

## K6b: C's mutation table; M10's test approved (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **C's runner change is accepted.** ROOT committed it on the K6b branch. `admission()` defers by name any row the binary's backstop would refuse, and defers a row whose counts line has no estimate for its mode.
  - K6's 138 rows and K6b's 270-row plan are unchanged. The runner suite passes 45 of 45.
- **The mutation table:** NONE passes, and 17 of 19 mutants are killed, M14 among them (the backstop omitted).
  - **M3e (Iy and Iz swapped)** is equivalent, and the equivalence is derived: Iy = Iz in every section used.
  - **M10 (the prefix limit b_j − 1)** survives. K4's budget tests fall before each segment's final work on these models, so the prefixes stop at the same place.
- **I16's assertion is approved:** each prefix limit equals its segment's exact end. Add it to `tests/k6b_w1.rs`, and re-run NONE and M10 from clean copies; M10 must be killed.
- **Next:** K6b waits for KF1. Then it merges main, re-runs W1-T3, runs W1-T4, and moves to D.

## KF1: rulings on I18's checkpoint-0 plan (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

The plan is `IMPLEMENTATION/KF1/PLAN_CHECKPOINT0.md` on the KF1 branch (sha256 `2129c337…`; committed by ROOT at `d0566126e`). **It is approved, with these rulings.**

- **The design is approved:** a `BoundedExtremeTracker` with at most T = 64 lazy rows and a pruned table of evaluated entries, collapsing when full.
  - The invariant argument is approved as the basis: bit-identical `finish` results, refusals included, for any collapse schedule.
  - The reviewer checks it independently.
- **Scope (I18's decision 1): KF1 bounds every `ExtremeTracker` site,** not only `rule`'s three: the pivot-margin (`adaptive.rs:999`), residual-gate (`:1236`) and fallback (`:1374`) trackers as well.
  - **Why:** W1's memory limit must rest on a bound that does not depend on the data. Leaving about 1.5 GB of data-dependent memory at 10,000 members would defeat it.
  - **The brief's item 3 is amended:** the work recorded in the stop rule, refinement and fallback stages may change. A tracker that today is dropped unevaluated is evaluated at a collapse, and that work is charged and budgeted where it is spent.
  - **Nothing else may change:** every published row, class, bound, attempt role and reason, and outcome under unlimited budgets.
  - Golden work counts are re-pinned where they move, each with its derivation.
  - The old `ExtremeTracker` is removed if no caller remains.
- **Many bodies (decision 2): include the shared cap across a call's trackers,** so a model with many small bodies is bounded too. State the resulting bound per call.
- **The budget boundary (decision 3)** is accepted and recorded. No W1 limits exist yet, and ROOT sets them from the measurements after KF1.
- **The test hook (decision 4)** is accepted only under `#[cfg(test)]`. A thread-local override of T must not exist in a non-test build.
- **After KF1 merges,** I16 recomputes K6b's E_max from KF1's code, for all trackers, before W1-T4.
- **Next:** checkpoint A. K6b's timed slot is over, so builds may run: one cargo job at `-j 4`.

## V-K: A1 accepted (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **A1 is accepted.** ROOT committed it at `37bff1780` on the V-K branch.
  - ROOT checked the key files' sha256, that both `SHA256SUMS` files verify (the cases and the kernel-lane observations), that no machine paths appear, and that there is no FK change.
  - 40 tests pass. Every one of the 201 CI cases passes, apart from THIN's two expected-unresolved cases; the `not_covered` set equals the committed list; all 506 discriminating controls fail.
  - §5.3's parity: K is bitwise equal between the sparse and dense paths, with matching classes, at up to 100 members.
  - VR's measured CI cost is a 3.8 s build and 37 s of tests on the Mac.
- **RF-MECH-DISC-CHAIN100 and -SPRING (103 members) take about 300 s each in dense mode.** This is K6's N10 dense-witness cost (KF2), not a new finding. They run in the `vk_records` example, not in CI, and CI's parity stays at 100 members or fewer.
- **Next:** A2: the seeded faults, the FK `mutation-controls` feature (VK-F05 included) and the kill matrix.
  - **KF1 is changing `ExtremeTracker` and its call sites in `K4R/adaptive.rs` now.** Keep V-K's fault sites off the tracker code and its callers' tracker lines, so the later merge of main is mechanical.
  - If KF1 merges first, V-K merges main and re-runs its fault matrix.

## KF1: checkpoint A accepted; the S11 site-table row authorized (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **A is accepted, pending one declared edit.**
  - `BoundedExtremeTracker` uses T = 64, and a shared `TrackerSet` caps a call at G = 512 unevaluated rows. All seven sites are converted, and the old tracker is removed.
  - **The differential test** against a verbatim copy of K4's tracker runs 828 streams at T = 1, 2, 3, 5 and 64, in both directions. `finish` is bit-identical, including refusals.
  - **The model-level differential** runs 131 controls, 4 combinations and the six 100-member frames at T = ∞, 1 and 64. Everything is identical except the width-16 work.
  - **Golden work** does not move. A new pin covers the collapsing frames.
  - All 10 mutants are killed. `gen_k4_vectors.py --check` passes 23 of 23.
  - **The bound:** about 2.3 MB of unevaluated rows per call in the stop rule, 275 KB for the pivot margin, 275 KB per residual-gate evaluation, and 1.1 MB for the fallback, against about 3.2 GB today at 10,000 members.
- **The site table: authorized.** Add one declared, additive row to `FK/tests/s11_site_table.rs`, for `adaptive.rs` `offer`: 2 integer accumulations, the row count and the held capacity. It is in KF1's write set by this ruling, as K4's rows were (Q8). No existing row changes.
- **The work findings are accepted:**
  - At T = 64 only the six 100-member frames move, and only in the stop rule: +2.2 to +13.4 M LME, at most about +15% of the stop rule's work (about 2% of the call). [Correction (I18 at D): ROOT misread I18's figure. The measured change is +21% to +159% of the stop rule's own work, and +2.5% to +16.2% of the case's total work (KF1 `RETURN.md` §5). The choice of T is reopened below.]
  - The remaining extra work comes from collapsed rows that a later best drops. It is bounded by one exact evaluation per row, whatever T is.
  - Cutting it further would need the approximation lemma in the correctness basis. That is declined: the accuracy-free argument stands.
  - T = 64 is kept.
- **For K6b's E_max:** the fallback's per-state row list (about n_f × 4.3 KB) is not a tracker. It is proportional to the model, not the data, and I16 includes it.
- **Next:** add the row, re-run the site-table tests and FK's full suite, then D: RETURN, CHANGE_RECORD, `_run_records/` and SHA256SUMS.

## KF1: D received; T reopened and set to 512 (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **D is received and committed,** on the KF1 branch: A at `68db15d41` and D at `d267a755b`. FK's full suite passes at 401; the site table gains the one declared row.
- **T is reopened on the corrected figures** (see the bracketed correction in "KF1: checkpoint A accepted"). At T = 64 the six 100-member frames gain +2.5% to +16.2% of their case work. I18's probe shows 0 extra at T = 512.
  - T never affects correctness: the invariant holds for any collapse schedule.
  - T = 512 with G = 8T = 4096 bounds a call's unevaluated rows at about 17.6 MB, plus the fallback's 4 × 2.2 MB and the tables. That is still data-independent and small next to W1's measured heap (about 100 MB at 1,000 members).
  - Memory is only used when the data keeps that many rows; the bound only caps it.
- **Ruling: T = 512 and G = 8T.**
  - The model-level differential runs at T = ∞, 1 and 512.
  - The T = 64 collapse pin is kept through the test hook, so collapse work stays exercised at model level.
  - Re-run the golden pins, NONE and the T-sensitive mutants (M7 no collapse, M8 shared cap ignored).
  - Record it in RETURN and CHANGE_RECORD as addendum 1, with the work table at T = 512.
- **The approximation lemma stays out of the correctness basis.**

## V-K: A2 accepted (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **A2 is accepted.** ROOT committed it at `c1fea8574` on the V-K branch.
  - **The FK diff is insertions only** (186 lines). Every fault site sits behind `#[cfg(any(test, feature = "mutation-controls"))]`, and the feature is declared in FK's `Cargo.toml` with no dependency change.
  - **The kill matrix** (`VR/observations/seeded/`, `SHA256SUMS` verifying): NONE passes 40 of 40, and all 15 faults are killed.
    - VK-F05 and VK-F06 are killed on THIN's attempts and outcome; VK-F07 and VK-R28 on evidence, as ruled.
    - VK-R28 raises CHAIN-n00100-AX to 512 and TREE-n00100-AX to 256, as R7 §7 predicts.
  - The §7.3 items R1 cannot discriminate are cited to K4's killing mutants: 3 (D3), the relabelling half of 10 (D10), and 16 (D16a and D16b).
  - FK's suite with the variable unset passes 394; the feature guard passes; K4's source scan and the S11 site table pass.
- **Next for V-K:** C, the harness mutants. B (the scale runs at 1,000 and 10,000 members) waits for KF1's merge: V-K merges main, re-runs the kill matrix, then runs B in one slot ROOT grants.

## KF1: to review (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **Addendum 1 (T = 512) is accepted,** committed at `1854911d1`.
  - No control or 100-member frame gains any work.
  - The stream differential is extended to 882 runs.
  - FK's full suite passes 401. NONE passes, and KF1-M7 and KF1-M8 are killed.
- **The PR:** [#1056](https://github.com/sgttomas/chirality/pull/1056). The full-SHA dispatch is 36621651732 (target_base `8cca91701`). GEN-8 passes on `1854911d1`.
- **The independent reviewer is RV20,** directed first to result equality at every site and collapse schedule, then to the memory bound, the work and the tests.
- **After merge:**
  - K6b merges main and recomputes E_max from KF1's code, then re-runs W1-T3 and runs W1-T4.
  - V-K merges main, re-runs its kill matrix, and runs B.

## V-K: C's harness mutants; three tests added (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **C ran 18 harness mutants and 2 controls** (NONE, and NONE-GEN, whose regeneration is byte-identical). 15 are killed and 3 survive:
  - **VK-H6:** max(|obs|, scale) in place of max(|exp|, scale);
  - **VK-H9:** an absolute-range pass counted as a pass;
  - **VK-H11:** a passing discriminating control dropped.
- **None of the three is a harness defect.** R1's committed CI data never reaches those paths.
  - Two tests that plan §14.1 promised were not delivered at A1: the absolute-range path on R1's five rows, and the controls test.
  - A1's unit test for H6 does not discriminate what its comment claims.
- **Ruling: option (a).** Add `VR/tests/engine.rs` with I17's three constructed-input tests, as drafted in `_run_records/c/proposed_tests_engine.rs.txt`:
  - obs = 1 with exp on either side of it;
  - R1's five sub-range rows judged as `PassAbsoluteRange`;
  - a passing discriminating control listed as undiscriminated.
  - Re-run only NONE, VK-H6, VK-H9 and VK-H11 from clean copies with the tests added. Adding tests cannot un-kill the other 15, so their results stand, recorded as from the first run.
  - Commit the matrix as `VR/observations/harness/harness_matrix.jsonl`.
- **The "data-equivalent" harness paths** (for example a failing comparison recorded as a pass) are evidenced by A2's kill matrix, whose faults show every comparison kind is live. That argument is recorded, not run as mutants.
- **Delete `<wt>/vk-mut/c`** (2.4 GB). The records keep every hash.
- **B still waits for KF1's merge.**

## V-K: C accepted (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **C is accepted.** ROOT committed it at `e24e911e6` on the V-K branch.
  - All 18 harness mutants are killed, and NONE (43 of 43) and NONE-GEN pass.
  - VK-H6, H9 and H11 are each killed by exactly its own new test in `VR/tests/engine.rs`.
  - `observations/harness/SHA256SUMS` verifies. No machine paths appear, and the mutant copies are deleted.
- **Next for V-K:** start D's records that do not depend on B. When KF1 merges: merge main, re-run the A2 kill matrix, run B in a slot ROOT grants, then finish D.

## KF1: rulings on RV20's review (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

RV20 (`REVIEW/KF1_REVIEW.md`, sha256 `d1cde558…`; records `REVIEW/_run_records/kf1_review/`) reviewed head `1854911d1`: **PASS**, with 0 BLOCKING, 1 SHOULD-FIX and 5 NOTEs.
- **Equality:** RV20 checked RETURN §3's proof step by step and found no difference over 36,000 streams, including probes with keys unrelated to values and arbitrary collapse schedules.
- The shared cap holds over 400 rounds. A key-only replay reproduces the work pins independently. FK's full suite passes 401.

**Fix before merge, as with earlier slices' SHOULD-FIX findings:**
- **RV20-1:** in the shared-cap test, assert per round that the bounded run's ctx16 work is at least the reference run's. This kills RV20-M4, a shared-cap collapse charged to a throwaway context.
- **N1:** add RV20's order test, which kills M5 (`RuleTest` reordered). M1 and M2 are recorded as equivalent: every reachable refusal is `Span`. [Correction (RV20, C-N1): the evidence is narrower. Every refusal constructed so far is `Span`, and it is not proven that no other stop is reachable. M1 and M2 are equivalent on every input constructed. The equality proof does not depend on this.]
- **N3:** restate the memory figures in RETURN.
  - The transient peak is G + T = 4,608 rows (19.8 MB), because `Vec` growth briefly holds both buffers; a standalone tracker peaks at 1.5T.
  - The tables' unconditional bound is at most 40 B per row kept in the window; the "one value entry" figure is practical only.
- **N5:** RETURN §0 and the head of CHANGE_RECORD point to addendum 1 for the shipped values: T = 512, G = 4096.
- **N2 and N4 are recorded.** M12 (fallback collapse work uncharged) is the disclosed limit; the code charges it correctly by reading. "No control gains work at T = 512" is printed, not asserted, and K6b re-measures at W1's sizes.

**Then:** CI and the dispatch on the new head, DEC-025 on it (the run under way on `1854911d1` is kept as the earlier head's record), GEN-8, a delta confirmation by RV20, and the merge.
- **RV20 confirms the final head `66adfede4`: PASS,** with no findings apart from one NOTE (C-N1, corrected above in brackets).
  - The change touches no `src/` file.
  - RV20-M4 and RV20-M5 are killed from clean archives.
  - N3's figures check.
  - SHA256SUMS verifies 42 of 42.

## KF1 merged (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **Merged:** [PR1056](https://github.com/sgttomas/chirality/pull/1056) at head `66adfede4`, merge `0f5d8c7b4`, 2026-09-29 21:34:25Z. The merge record is `IMPLEMENTATION/KF1_MERGE/RECORD.md`.
- **The gates:**
  - RV20 PASSED the review and confirmed the final head;
  - hosted CI was green, and the dispatch (36628173972) succeeded;
  - DEC-025 was clean on the final head: only frame_kernel changes, 394 → 402;
  - GEN-8 passed.
- **Next:**
  - **K6b (I16):** merge main, recompute E_max from KF1's code, then re-run W1-T3 and run W1-T4 in slot K6B-S3. I17 holds cargo during the slot.
  - **V-K (I17):** merge main, re-run the A2 kill matrix, then B in its own slot after K6b's.
  - **Then** ROOT's W1 limits from K6, K6b, V-K and K4's work counts, and F2a.

## K6b: main merged; E_max from KF1; slot K6B-S3 approved (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **ROOT merged main `0f5d8c7b4`** (KF1) into the K6b branch as `b86081221`, and into the V-K branch as `485320e95`. There were no conflicts.
  - [Correction: ROOT's first message asked both implementers to prepare the merge themselves. That was withdrawn before any merge ran, because a merge writes the index, which TASKs may not do. I16 disclosed a `git fetch`, which updates only remote-tracking refs.]
- **E_max now follows KF1's bounds at every site.** ROOT committed it as `082990c8d`.
  - It includes the pivot-margin, residual-gate and fallback sites, which were missing before KF1.
  - At 10,000 members E_max is 2.78–2.86 GB, down from 9.2–9.5, and the binary's backstop admits all six W1-T4 models.
  - H passes 70 of 70, the runner 45 of 45, and the wrapper with the pins 47 of 47.
- **Slot K6B-S3 is approved,** with a fresh records folder:
  - W1-T1 to W1-T3 re-run (about 2.5 min), which gives ρ against the new E and the ascent;
  - then W1-T4 (about 15–17 min).
  - The binary is a release build from a `git archive` of `082990c8d`.
  - B's pre-KF1 records stay as they are, as the before-KF1 comparison.
- **The slot starts when I17 finishes V-K's post-merge checks.** I16 may build the release binary now. A heap-cap abort or any other stop condition stops the tier.

## K6b: slot K6B-S3 stopped at W1-T4's first row; W1 at 10,000 members ends in Span (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **What ran.**
  - **W1-T1 to W1-T3, re-run on the post-KF1 binary** (sha256 `4f55137b…`, from `082990c8d`, into fresh records): 108 processes, all ok, with every parity item true and every `w1a` row selected at 128.
    - ρ_fp against the new E: 0.10–0.12 at 10 members, 0.26–0.38 at 100, and 0.38–0.40 at 1,000; the DEC-053 nine reach up to 0.48.
    - The stop rule adds no measurable heap at 1,000 members. KF1's bounded tracker fits under the verification's earlier peak.
  - **W1-T4, row 247 (CHAIN-n10000-AX, `w1a`),** is deterministic over 5 repeats:
    - the 128 candidate is rejected by its verification;
    - the 256 verification's shared build stops with `Span`, so the outcome is `Unresolved(ExactSumSpan)`;
    - 6.84e9 LME are charged, the heap peak is 832 MiB, and the call takes about 5 s.
    - K6b's parity item `w1_stages_equal_totals` then failed, and the runner stopped the tier correctly.
- **(a) The parity item: K6b fixes its own check,** in H only, as I16 proposes:
  - the stage identity is checked on completed builds only;
  - on a failed build, the check is that the stage sum is at most the charged total, and the unstaged remainder goes on the attempt line;
  - the outcome's per-precision shared work uses the charged totals;
  - a test reaches the failed-build path at a small size, and a mutant is killed.
  - **The FK side is routed to KF3.** The verification's shared build (`verify.rs:471-485`) records no stage for the partial `uc` work when `gamma_m` or `uc_bounds` stops. The charged total is right: `verify_precision` charges all of it. So the evidence's stage breakdown under-reports on this error path, and F2a will publish that evidence.
- **(b) The availability finding is routed to KF3,** after the data below.
  - **ROOT's reading of the code** (`bound.rs:405-420`): `uc_bounds` runs directed recurrences (`u_pass`, `nl_pass`) over the factor's profile. On a long chain the comparison-matrix bound grows geometrically, so its exact sums exceed `ExactWideSum`'s span, and the whole attempt stops.
  - **But B = min(Uc, S) per block** (R7, Lemmas D and E), and S is an independent certified bound. Treating a Uc that cannot be formed as +∞ keeps every step certified: B = S. The attempt stops only if neither bound is available.
  - **Honesty is unaffected:** no published value changes, only whether W1 can publish.
  - **KF3 will:**
    - treat a Uc (and likewise an S) that cannot be formed as unavailable, not as an attempt stop, with R7's text checked for any other reader of Uc;
    - record the partial stage work on every error path.
  - KF3 is briefed after W1-T4's re-run shows which of the six 10,000-member models stop, and where.
- **(c) W1-T4:**
  - row 247's record is kept as the stop's evidence, not voided;
  - after (a), ROOT commits the fix and grants a slot in which all 24 W1-T4 rows run on the rebuilt binary, in a new records folder (about 10–15 minutes);
  - after KF3 merges, W1-T4 runs once more; those are the figures ROOT's W1 limits use.
- **D waits** for the final W1-T4.

## V-K: B prepared; ExactSumSpan recorded, not a stop (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **B's code is committed** at `64470c6ba`: `VR/src/scale.rs`, `examples/vk_scale.rs` and `runner/vk_scale_runner.py`.
  - The small-size check passes: the records `vk_scale` emits at 10 and 100 members are byte-identical to the committed ones, and VR passes 44 of 44.
  - The admission estimate is a cited copy of K6b's E_max on KF1's trackers, because VR cannot depend on the harness. Deduplicating it once K6b merges is recorded as a follow-up.
- **The large model files** are generated with `gen_vk_cases.py --large` and checked against `large_models.sha256`. B's binary is a release build from a `git archive` of `64470c6ba`.
- **ExactSumSpan in B:**
  - an `Unresolved(ExactSumSpan)` outcome at 10,000 members is the KF3 availability finding;
  - it is recorded with its attempts and work, and its rows are reported as a separate `unresolved_availability` count, never as passes;
  - the tier continues;
  - it is a named, narrow runner exception, with a test;
  - any other unresolved reason, a covered-row failure or any other stop condition still stops;
  - V3's final figures re-run after KF3.
- **Order of slots:** K6b's W1-T4 re-run first (short), then V-K's B.

## V-K B accepted; KF3 spawned (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **V-K's B is accepted.** ROOT committed its records at `f5379a5d4` on the V-K branch.
  - **V1 (100 members) and V2 (1,000):** 12 of 12 selected at 128, every row passes, and C9's floor sets are empty.
  - **V3 (10,000):** CONT-n10000-AX is selected at 128, with 211 passes and 4 absolute-range passes out of 215. The other five end `Unresolved(ExactSumSpan)` in the 256 verification's shared build, before `uc`, recorded under the named exception. [Correction (ROOT, 2026-09-30, RV25-N4): "before `uc`" should read "before the Uc bounds complete". The shared build recorded no `uc` stage for the partial work, and KF3's diagnosis places the stop inside `uc_bounds`.]
  - No watchdog kill, heap-cap abort or memory-guard kill occurred.
  - W1 at 10,000 members takes 5–10 s per call and about 0.82 GB of heap, against E_max of 2.7 GB (ρ 0.32–0.37). [Correction (ROOT, 2026-09-30, RV25-S2): these GB figures are MiB divided by 1,000, the E_adm slip again. VK RETURN §14.3 gives a heap of 816.5–835.0 MiB (0.86–0.88 GB) and E_max 2,676–2,752 MiB (2.81–2.89 GB). ρ is unaffected.]
- **KF3 is spawned as I19** (`TASK_BRIEFS/I19_KF3_IMPLEMENTATION.md`), on branch `codex/piping-kf3-20260929` in `<wt>/kf3`, from main `0f5d8c7b4`. It covers:
  - the diagnosis of the Span;
  - D1 revision 5a.3 **amendment A2**, which ROOT records when KF3's plan confirms the reading: a certified bound (Uc or S) that cannot be formed is +∞, so B = min over the available bounds, and the attempt stops only if a block needs a bound and none is available;
  - partial stage work recorded on every error path.
  - **Checkpoint 0 is diagnosis and plan only.** Builds wait until K6b's current slot ends.
- **After KF3 merges:** K6b and V-K merge main and re-run their 10,000-member tiers. Those figures, with K6, K4's counts and the rest of K6b's and V-K's measurements, are the basis for ROOT's W1 limits.

## K6b: slot K6B-S4 (b3) accepted; D now, with W1-T4 pre-KF3; V-K's PR to review (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **b3 is accepted.** It ran 132 processes, all ok, with 0 parity failures and 0 deferrals, on the binary `20b67776…` built from `4eeb206c0`.
  - **K6b's six 10,000-member rows agree with V-K's B.** CONT-AX is selected at 128; the other five end `Unresolved(ExactSumSpan)` in the 256 verification's `uc` stage, after bounded and wide formation. The fixed parity check passes on all of them.
  - **CONT-AX at 10,000 members:**
    - the call charges 8.23e9 LME, with a heap of 814 MiB and a median call of 6.09 s, 7.6 times the binary64 sparse entry;
    - its stop rule is 2.60e9 LME, 31.5% of the call.
  - W1's heap grows with a log-log slope of 0.92–0.98 from 10 to 10,000 members.
  - ρ_fp is at most 0.43 against the new E, and E_adm at 10,000 members is 2.65–2.73 GiB. [Correction (I16 at D): E_adm at 10,000 members is 2,649–2,727 MiB, which is 2.59–2.66 GiB (2.78–2.86 GB). The b3 report had divided MiB by 1,000.]
  - **A K6 observation, not a stop:** K6's own sparse estimate gives ρ_fp up to 1.75 at 10,000 members (CHAIN-AX). The excess is outside the heap: heap/E is 0.64–0.73.
- **D proceeds now, as for V-K.** K6b's records mark W1-T4's 10,000-member figures pre-KF3.
  - After KF3 merges, K6b merges main and re-runs W1-T4 as a records addendum, which may follow K6b's merge.
  - ROOT's W1 limits use the post-KF3 figures.
- **V-K's PR** [#1057](https://github.com/sgttomas/chirality/pull/1057) is open. The dispatch is 36640221444. The independent reviewer is RV21.

## KF3: rulings on I19's diagnosis and plan; D1 revision 5a.3 amendment A2 (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

The plan is `IMPLEMENTATION/KF3/PLAN_CHECKPOINT0.md` on the KF3 branch (sha256 `721fc2d6…`). **It is approved.**

- **The diagnosis is accepted.** The five frames stop in `build_verify_shared`, then `uc_bounds`, then `u_pass`: an `add_toward` whose addends lie more than 8,128 bits apart.
  - **U_c grows geometrically along the chain:** log2 U_c ≈ α·N + β, with α from 1.74 to 6.6 bits per member on the five frames. The true norm grows only polynomially.
  - The first refusal is predicted between about 1,200 and 4,500 members.
  - It is not an exponent overflow, and neither `gamma_m`, `nl_pass` nor `bounds_from` is involved.
- **D1 revision 5a.3, amendment A2 (ROOT's ruling):**
  - a Uc_c or S_c whose formation is refused, by `Span` or `Exponent`, is unavailable. It is treated as R7's existing "does not exist" (+∞);
  - B_c is the minimum over the bounds that were formed;
  - `u_pass` and `nl_pass` mark only the refused block and skip its remaining rows, and every other block runs as today;
  - **honesty:** every step of the guarantee (Lemmas A to C, the Theorem and the Corollary) uses B_c only through B_c ≥ ‖K̃_c⁻¹‖₁. A2's B_c is the minimum of a nonempty set of formed bounds, each certified by Lemma D or E, and a refusal changes no formed value. So A2 affects availability only. The reviewer checks this against every reader in plan §3.
  - `DESIGN.md` stays hash-pinned; the amendment is this ruling.
- **The decisions in plan §11:**
  1. **A block with data and no bound, after a refusal:** the attempt stops with that refusal, as today.
  2. **A refusal stop takes precedence** over another block's `uc` rejection. The outcome is deterministic and conservative.
  3. **The refusal evidence** goes on `AttemptRecord` (`bound_refusals`) only.
  4. **The constructed slender chain** is approved as the CI model (a planar chain along (3,4,0), under about 200 members). Report its debug CI time, and ask if it exceeds about 60 s.
  5. **The test-only hook that removes S** for the W2 test: reuse V-K's `seeded` module if V-K is on main first; otherwise add a `#[cfg(test)]` hook in KF3.
  6. **The scale driver for B:** main's drivers if V-K and K6b have merged first. Otherwise, their `vk_scale` and `k6_observe` built from `git archive` copies of their branches, which is read-only.
  7. **`wide_sum.rs`: one method, authorized,** added to KF3's write set: a full accumulator reset after a refusal, as a safeguard, with a unit test.
  8. **No early exit or "sticky" directed add.** Token-level identity on RF-LARGE-100 is kept.
  9. **est_c stays out of A2.**
- **Partial stages:** all four builds (`build_shared`, `solve_case_at`, `build_verify_shared` and `verify_state`) add the charged work their stages do not record to the stage in progress, so the stages sum to the charged total on every path.
- **Merge order with K6b** (whose test asserts `shared_stages.uc == 0` on a stopped build, and whose parity check tolerates unstaged work):
  - **whichever of KF3 and K6b merges second** updates that test and tightens the parity check back to equality, in its own PR;
  - if KF3 is second, `performance_harness/tests/k6b_w1.rs` and `src/k6/w1/staged.rs` join KF3's write set for that purpose only.
- **Next:** checkpoint A. Builds may run, with one cargo job at `-j 4`; RV21 is reviewing V-K alongside.

## K6b: D accepted; PR to review (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **D is committed** on the K6b branch: `126fcb9f3` (the packet code and b3's packet) and `1123d19b9` (RETURN, CHANGE_RECORD and 1,774 run-record files, 21 MB, with oversized dumps trimmed and their sha256 kept).
  - Both `SHA256SUMS` verify, and no machine paths appear.
  - W1-T4 is marked pre-KF3 throughout, and the post-KF3 re-run is RETURN addendum 1.
- **I16's corrections and notes are recorded:**
  - E_adm at 10,000 members (bracketed above);
  - KF1 moves the stop rule's cost from memory to work: at 1,000 members the heap increment is gone, and the work rises 1.2–2.4×;
  - the 141 B constant in the sparse cross-check (N-4) is a note.
- **The PR** is open, with its full-SHA dispatch. The independent reviewer is RV22.

## V-K: rulings on RV21's review (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

RV21 (`REVIEW/VK_REVIEW.md`, sha256 `eab89fb5…`; records `REVIEW/_run_records/vk_review/`) reviewed head `3fd1baff3`: **PASS**, with 0 BLOCKING, 2 SHOULD-FIX and 5 NOTEs.
- **No way was found for the harness to pass a wrong answer on a covered row:**
  - 225,405 engine vectors against RV21's own `Fraction` oracle;
  - 129,968 wrong answers through the harness's own path, every one failed, with the exact boundary pinned to the ulp on 16,778 rows;
  - nine whole-case probes.
- **Also confirmed by RV21:**
  - its independent adapter matches every committed model;
  - the floor lists re-derive as 46, 3 and 2;
  - FK is unchanged with the feature off, and FK's suite passes 402;
  - A0 is visibility only;
  - B's exception is narrow;
  - every `SHA256SUMS` verifies.

**Fix before merge:**
- **RV21-1:** the feature guard also flags a manifest that enables VR's `seeded-faults`, which enables FK's `mutation-controls` indirectly. Use RV21's one-line fix and its self-test.
- **RV21-2:** add RV21's two drafted tests, a wrong observation of an out-of-range row fails, and an `Overflow` row fails. They kill RV21's mutants H4 and H6.
- **N1:** RETURN and CHANGE_RECORD are brought to the final head's counts.

**Recorded, optional:**
- **N2:** the generator's subprocess `--model` check (RV21 ran it: 191 runs).
- **N3:** a CI check that `not_covered.json` equals the committed set.
- **N4 and N5.**

**Then:** CI and the dispatch on the new head, DEC-025 (which gains VR's manifest), GEN-8, RV21's confirmation, and the merge.
- **RV21 confirms V-K's final head `5f0d39426`: PASS, with no new finding.**
  - The change touches no `src/` file in FK or VR.
  - RV21-1 is as drafted.
  - RV21-H4 and RV21-H6 are each killed by exactly their own test, and NONE passes 47 of 47.
  - N3's set check catches a planted duplicate.
  - The records match the head, and every `SHA256SUMS` verifies.
  - GEN-8 passes on `5f0d39426`.

## K6b: rulings on RV22's review (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

RV22 (`REVIEW/K6B_REVIEW.md`; records `REVIEW/_run_records/k6b_review/`) reviewed head `1123d19b9`: **PASS**, with 0 BLOCKING, 3 SHOULD-FIX and 7 NOTEs.
- **No product byte changes.** A0's patch-id equals both A0 commits.
- **The W1 mode:** RV22's K4SRC decode matches R1's models; its release `w1a` runs reproduce b3 byte for byte; the work closure has 0 discrepancies over 330 outcomes.
- **The records:** 934 RETURN values trace to the raw JSONL with 0 mismatches; the packet regenerates; the merge `b86081221` is clean.

**Fix all three SHOULD-FIX findings before merge.** ROOT's W1 limits will rest on E_max and on the stage evidence.
- **RV22-1:** tighten `stages_equal_totals` on stopped builds to at most one side short (`own == own_total || shared == shared_total`), each short side at most its total. Report `stages_complete` as unstaged == (0, 0). Add a test with RV22's probe, the 1-LME under-record on a stop-rule stop, and kill it.
- **RV22-2:** E_max must be an upper bound on every phase.
  - Add the 1024 verification's live vectors (about 3n + 8n_f wide values, and `recover`'s output) and the shift's profile clone (`bound.rs:560`) to the verification phase.
  - Add the solve-phase fallback items (`abar_q`, `evaluated`, `rhs`, `u_free`, the per-state u) under the move model.
  - Regenerate `counts.jsonl`, and state the change in RETURN: +5.4% on CHAIN and TREE and +2.1% on CONT at 10,000 members, and 0 at 1,000 or fewer. b3's admissions are unaffected. [Correction (I16): the change at 1,000 members is +3.28% (CHAIN, TREE) and +2.33% (CONT), because under the move model the fallback's items outgrow the tracker term there; at 10 and 100 members and on the nine it is +0.04–0.22%. b3's admissions are still unaffected: 0 decisions change.]
- **RV22-3:** add a test that recomputes every committed `counts.jsonl` line's E_max and E_sel128 from the code, and one that exercises the solve-phase terms at a size where they bind. Kill RV22-M6.

**The NOTEs are recorded:** RETURN's load range, the move-model heap/E column, the adapter through K6's section formula, and the two further unstaged paths, which go to KF3. RV22-M5 (the binary's prefix parity always true) and RV22-M7 (the backstop against the RSS cap) are killed if cheap, and otherwise recorded; RV22-M2 is equivalent on single-case models.

**Then:** CI and the dispatch on the new head, DEC-025, GEN-8, RV22's confirmation, and the merge.

## KF3: checkpoint A accepted (ROOT, 2026-09-29)

- **A is accepted.** ROOT committed it on the KF3 branch: `29c0b69e4` (the code and tests) and `a7ec4981a` (the checkpoint record).
  - **Amendment A2 is implemented as ruled:**
    - a refused bound marks only its block;
    - B = min over the formed bounds;
    - a block with data and no bound stops with the refusal, which outranks a `uc` rejection;
    - budget stops are never refusals;
    - refusals are recorded per block.
  - **Partial stage work** is staged on every path of all four builds.
  - **No control changes** outcome, row, class, bound or golden work; only the new `kf3.txt` controls move.
  - FK's full suite passes, `gen --check` is byte-identical on every earlier file, and 11 mutants are killed.
- **The constructed CI model is 390 members,** not under about 200. I19 found that slender sections shift log2 U_c by a constant and leave its growth rate unchanged. KF3-UC-SPAN, a chain along (−1, 12, −12) growing about 20.8 bits per member, is the smallest that refuses.
  - On main it ends `Unresolved(ExactSumSpan)`. Under KF3 it is selected at 128 with B = S_c, and is honest against GEN on 8,983 checks, the worst at 0.969 of its allowance, with G5a passing.
  - Its debug CI time is 38–64 s for the KF3 tests, which is accepted.
- **B (the scale evidence) waits for V-K's merge,** which carries `retained_api` and `vk_scale` to main. ROOT then merges main into KF3, and I19 runs B with `vk_scale` built from a `git archive` of that merged head, in a slot ROOT grants.
- **RV22's findings are closed** on the K6b branch.
  - **RV22-1:** at most one short side on a stopped build.
    - **I16's extension is accepted:** a stopped candidate that charged stop-rule work is held to equality. The decision runs only after its builds complete, and only that rule catches RV22's probe.
  - **RV22-2:** E_max bounds every modelled phase. At 10,000 members it is 2.64–2.81 GiB, and b3's admissions are unchanged.
  - **RV22-3:** tests recompute every committed line's estimate.
  - Of the new mutants, 10 of 11 are killed. RV22-M5B, the binary's call site forced true, survives and is recorded: no binary run can produce a false prefix, and the library form (M5L) is killed.
- **Then:** CI and the dispatch on the new head, DEC-025 after V-K's, GEN-8, RV22's confirmation, and the merge.

## V-K merged (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

- **Merged:** [PR1057](https://github.com/sgttomas/chirality/pull/1057) at head `5f0d39426`, merge `f8400d290`, 2026-09-30 00:26:51Z. The merge record is `IMPLEMENTATION/VK_MERGE/RECORD.md`.
- **The gates:**
  - RV21 PASSED the review and confirmed the final head;
  - hosted CI was green, and the dispatch (36646861753) succeeded;
  - DEC-025 was clean: the only change is the new `numerical_robustness` (47 tests), and frame_kernel is unchanged at 402;
  - GEN-8 passed.
- **FK's `retained_api` export is now on main.** K6b's identical A0 merges cleanly.
- **Next:**
  - ROOT merges main into KF3 and K6b;
  - KF3's B (the scale evidence) runs with main's `vk_scale`;
  - K6b's gates continue.

## Main merged into K6b and KF3 (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

- **K6b:** ROOT merged main `f8400d290` (V-K) as `597c81ba4`.
  - The conflicts in `retained/adaptive.rs` and `verify.rs` were resolved to main's versions. K6b's FK change was exactly A0 (patch-id `b43efeb4`), and A0 is identical on main, so main's FK (A0 plus V-K's gated sites) is the merged result.
  - K6b's FK now equals main's. The full-SHA dispatch 36650532005 runs on the new head.
- **KF3:** ROOT started the merge of main `f8400d290`. There is one conflict hunk, in `AttemptRecord`: A0 made `verification_shared_work` and `verification_shared_built_here` public, and KF3 added `bound_refusals` beside them.
  - **Resolution rule:** under A0's rule (the fields of evidence records are public; "V-K: rulings on I17's checkpoint-0 plan" Q8), `bound_refusals` is `pub`. `BlockRefusal`, and any type it carries, becomes `pub` and is added to the `retained_api` facade.
  - I19 resolves the conflict markers by editing only; ROOT stages and commits the merge.
- **KF3's write set gains, for the merge only:**
  - `FK/src/structural.rs`'s facade lines, for `BlockRefusal`;
  - **VR's committed records** (`VR/observations/**`), if KF3's partial-stage recording or `bound_refusals` changes them. They are regenerated with VR's own tools, only the expected fields may change, and VR's suite and kill matrix must pass. V-K's tests compare its records byte for byte, and V-K is now on main.
- **K6b's `uc == 0` test and parity check** follow the earlier rule: whichever of KF3 and K6b merges second updates them.
- **RV22 confirms K6b's `011911e4e`: PASS.** RV22-1, RV22-2 and RV22-3 are closed.
  - RV22's independent itemization is at or below E_max on all 33 lines, and 0 of b3's 132 admissions change.
  - RV22-M5B is acceptable as recorded.
  - **Two new NOTEs, recorded:**
    - C-N1: a stop inside the solve (`into_solve_128`) has no test, so RV22-C4 survives;
    - C-N2: on a stopped verification build, the two builds' summed stages can hide one build's shortfall. This is within the ruling, and KF3's equality closes it.
  - Because K6b's head is now ROOT's merge `597c81ba4`, RV22 checks that the merge adds exactly main's delta and that H passes on the merged tree.
- **RV22's merge check of `597c81ba4`: PASS, with no findings.**
  - Path by path over 59,471 paths, there are 0 mismatches. The first-parent diff is main's delta less A0, which both sides carry.
  - FK equals main's byte for byte.
  - The remerge diff covers only the two resolved conflicts, each keeping main's side.
  - H passes 74 tests plus `k6_alloc`, and the runner 47 of 47, on a clean archive.

## K6b merged (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

- **Merged:** [PR1058](https://github.com/sgttomas/chirality/pull/1058) at head `597c81ba4`, merge `78f55f927`, 2026-09-30 01:08:38Z. The merge record is `IMPLEMENTATION/K6B_MERGE/RECORD.md`.
- **The gates, on `597c81ba4`:**
  - RV22 PASSED the review, confirmed `011911e4e`, and passed the merge check of `597c81ba4`;
  - hosted CI was green: the four pull_request runs and the full-SHA dispatch 36650532005;
  - DEC-025 was clean against V-K's Mac run (keyed by manifest path): the only suite change is performance_harness, 54 → 74 (K6b's tests). frame_kernel is unchanged, and the failing tests are exactly the three known Mac platform tests. pytest passed 3070 (V-K's 3062, plus K6b's 8 runner tests: `test_k6_runner.py` has 39 → 47), vitest 2822 of 2822, and both builds exited 0;
  - GEN-8 passed.
- **Still routed from K6b:**
  - W1-T4 at 10,000 members re-runs after KF3 merges, as a records addendum (RETURN addendum 1);
  - VR's cited copy of E_max is deduplicated against K6b's, with RV22-2's terms;
  - RV22's C-N1 (no test of a stop inside the solve) stays open as a NOTE.

## KF3: main merged; K6b's parity restored in KF3; B's slot granted (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

- **The merge of main `f8400d290` (V-K) is committed as `c0473301e`.** I19 resolved the one conflict by editing only; ROOT staged and committed.
  - ROOT checked that each resolved file differs from main's side only by the ruled visibility: `bound_refusals` `pub` in adaptive.rs; `BlockRefusal`, `BoundRefusal`, `RefusalKind`, `BoundPass` and `CertifiedBound` `pub` in bound.rs; and one facade line in structural.rs.
  - I19 reports that FK (348 lib, 7 integration files, 6 doc-tests), VR (47) and H build without warnings and pass, and that VR's records regenerate byte for byte, so no VR record changes.
- **Main `78f55f927` (K6b) is merged as `e114b23c1`,** with no conflict. K6b changes no FK file.
- **KF3 merges second, so KF3 updates K6b's checks (the earlier rule).** KF3's write set gains:
  - `performance_harness/src/k6/w1/staged.rs`: `stages_equal_totals` requires equality on every attempt, completed or stopped. Its doc comment says so and cites KF3. `unstaged` and `stages_complete` stay, since the attempt line records them (RV22-1). They are now always (0, 0) and true, and a test asserts that on a stopped build;
  - `performance_harness/tests/k6b_w1.rs`: the `uc == 0` assertion on the budget-stopped build becomes the partial `uc` work KF3 records, and the relaxation tests (one short side accepted) now expect `false`. RV22's C-N2 closes here;
  - `performance_harness/runner/**`, only if the runner encodes the relaxation.
  - Anything else in H is a stop. H's suite (`--all-targets`, with `k6_alloc`) and the runner's suite must pass.
- **B's slot is granted now.** No other slice is building, and ROOT's records work uses no cargo.
  - The slot covers the H update above, then B: RF-LARGE-CHAIN-n10000-AX through W1, and the other five 10,000-member RF-LARGE frames with main's `vk_scale`, each with its outcome and, where it publishes, its honesty against R1.
  - It ends with I19's report.

## KF2: spawn (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

- **KF2 (K6's N10) is spawned as I20** (`TASK_BRIEFS/I20_KF2_IMPLEMENTATION.md`), on branch `codex/piping-kf2-20260930` in `<wt>/kf2`, from main `78f55f927` (K6b merged).
- **ROOT's reading** (for I20 to confirm or refute):
  - the dense negative-pair witness is O(n⁴): every pair allocates an n-vector, re-validates, and scans n² entries;
  - K1's sparse witness already evaluates a pair in O(1), in the dense order.
  - So the dense witness can be made O(n²) with every result bit-identical, errors included. That is the slice.
- **The dense pivot screen** (2j + 2 against the skyline's 2(i − first_i) + 2) is **diagnosed and proposed only.** Changing it changes published dense classes, so it needs ROOT's ruling, and possibly an owner-facing note.
- **Product-reaching gates:** review, T9 (112 of 112), the both-entry gate (part 1 byte-identical; part 2's four dense N10 runs must end within 1,800 s), CI with the dispatch, DEC-025, GEN-8 and the src-tauri suite.
- **Host:** KF3's slot B is running, so checkpoint 0 is reading only. I20's first build waits for ROOT's word.
- **KF2 does not block W1's limits or F2a.** It is on the T3-close list.

## KF3: checkpoint B accepted; two findings for D (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

- **Accepted and committed on the KF3 branch as `ae831ca51`:** H's parity update and B's records.
  - **H:** `stages_equal_totals` holds every attempt to equality. The budget-stopped build carries its partial `uc` work, the one-short-side probes expect `false` (RV22's C-N2 closed), and a new test finds nothing unstaged at every segment end and midpoint of CHAIN-n00010-AX. H's suite and the runner's 47 pass. The runner needed no change.
  - **B:** `vk_scale` in release, from a `git archive` of `e114b23c1`, with V-K's runner unedited.
    - V1 and V2 (12 models) are byte-identical to V-K's B, charged work included.
    - **At 10,000 members:**
      - CHAIN-AX, CHAIN-ROT and CONT-ROT move from `Unresolved(ExactSumSpan)` to **selected at 128**, and pass R1 on every row (103, 103, and 214 plus 1 absolute-range of 215). Uc is refused in the forward pass, so B = S_c, with one shifted factorization each. Charged work is 10.1, 12.1 and 10.4 G LME, against 6.7, 8.3 and 6.8 before KF3.
      - CONT-AX is unchanged.
      - **TREE-AX and TREE-ROT** move from `Unresolved(ExactSumSpan)` to `Unresolved(Ceiling)`. R7's verification estimate (b) rejects them at 128, 256 and 512, on member 1's end force at the root, and the ceiling is reached after the 1024 verification. They publish nothing, before and after, and charge 65.3 and 74.2 G LME (6.6 and 8.1 before).
    - Every published row passes R1, and every C9 S_full set is empty.
    - The refusals' rows match the plan's forward-pass prediction on all five frames.
- **Finding KF3-B1: the TREE frames at 10,000 members are an availability loss of estimate (b), not of KF3.** They are honest: nothing is published.
  - **For D:** from the existing records only, with no new heavy run, give (b)'s estimate against its threshold at the rejecting row for each precision. Classify the loss as a design limit (like THIN) or slack in (b). ROOT rules from that.
  - **For W1's limits:** a case budget ends these cases earlier. Their charged work before `Ceiling` (65–74 G LME) is recorded.
  - **RETURN must say plainly** that the runner summary's `fail` column for these two frames counts unpublished rows, and that no wrong value was published.
- **Finding KF3-B2: the measured heap exceeds E_max.** [Correction (ROOT, 2026-09-30, RV25-S1): the figures below compare against VR's stale port of E_max, and like for like K6b's final formula bounds the measured peaks (see the correction in "KF3: D accepted; KF3-B1 and KF3-B2 routed"). KF3-B2 stands on the code derivation of an under-count, not on a measured excess.] TREE-AX peaks at 2,889.9 MiB against E_max 2,750 (ρ ≈ 1.05), and TREE-ROT at 2,891.5 against 2,752. The ruling on RV22-2 requires E_max to be an upper bound on every phase.
  - **For D:** derive, with file:line, which allocations are alive at the peak, and whether pre-KF3 code on the same path holds them. There are two possibilities:
    - a K6b omission that no earlier run reached (I19's reading: the shifted factorization's two profile copies at 1024 bits);
    - a KF3 change in what is alive.
  - **Routing, once derived:**
    - a K6b omission goes to K6b's post-KF3 follow-up, which becomes a small H PR with its own review: the E_max term, `counts.jsonl` regenerated, and W1-T4 re-run;
    - a KF3-induced term is fixed in KF3 before its PR.
  - **Either way, ROOT's W1 limits wait for E_max to bound every phase at 10,000 members.**
- **Next:** checkpoint D, with KF3-B1 and KF3-B2 derived.

## KF2: rulings on I20's checkpoint-0 plan (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

- **The plan is accepted,** and committed on the KF2 branch as `573bd3835` (`IMPLEMENTATION/KF2/PLAN_CHECKPOINT0.md`, sha256 `76337c43…`).
- **ROOT checked the equality argument (§4) and accepts it:**
  - **The design:** an O(1) guard per pair repeats `verify_negative_direction`'s exact arithmetic on the pair's four cells, in its order. Only a pair the guard marks as a witness is passed to the unchanged verifier, which produces the published value.
  - **Why it holds:**
    - validation's result is the same at every call;
    - the direction check always passes;
    - the verifier's nonzero cells are exactly the guard's cells, in the same order, with the same operations;
    - so both reach the same first error or the same verdict.
  - Zero couplings are still visited, so the equality holds for every value of the type, not only on `prepare_bound`'s invariants.
- **The cost:** ROOT confirmed that the old witness is O(n⁴). The prediction at 6,006 DOFs is about 31 days, a lower bound. At K6's kill about 0.06% of the pairs had been searched. The new witness is predicted at about 1 s; A measures it.
- **Q1: (a), approved.** The tests go in a new `FK/structural/kf2_witness_tests.rs`, and FKS gains one `#[cfg(test)] mod kf2_witness_tests;` line beside `s11f_tests` and `s11k_tests`.
- **Q2: approved.** N10's two models run through H's unchanged `k6_observe`, built in release from a `git archive` of the KF2 tree. H is not edited.
- **Q3: the screen is declined for KF2 and split out.** KF2 stays byte-identical.
  - **What a change would alter:** I20 showed a profile-based operation count is honest, because the dense factor's entries before a row's first nonzero are exact ±0. But the change alters every dense report's bytes, since `PivotEvidence.operation_count` and `.screen` are published (PP:1106-1107): T9's 56 dense outputs, and the dense part-1 envelopes. It also changes dense classes. That is certain on the N10 pair and likely on RF-CHAIN-A and RF-CHAIN-T at n10-r1e-12; RF-SKEW-T-PIN-OFF-122 and RF-WEAK-W-L at r1e-12 are candidates.
  - **Routed:** a separate dense-screen slice on the T3-close list, with an owner-facing note, since dense scrutiny's published standing changes. It is not scheduled yet.
- **Q4: no budget in the witness.**
  - **Recorded for the owner:** the dense route observes cancellation only before the solve and before publication (APP:1688-1692, :1711-1717). A cancelled dense job keeps its thread and memory until the solve returns. After KF2 the dense factor is the long step (65–188 s at 1,000 members). [Correction (ROOT, 2026-09-30, RV25-N3): 65–86 s at 1,000 members; 166–188 s at K6's 1,364-member ceiling (B3).]
  - Routed as an observation to T6 and T9; it is not T3 scope.
- **Q5: the site-table row is authorized:** `("FK/structural.rs", "negative_pair_witness_counted", 6, …)`, one declared, additive row.
- **Q6: yes.** SD's suite is added at A (SD:37 and `k1_tests.rs:371` call the witness).
- **Q7: confirmed.** The one private helper is `negative_pair_witness_counted`, holding the loop, the counts and the pair evaluation inline.
- **Builds may start now:** one cargo job at `-j 4`, `<wt>/kf2-target`, with the memory guard running. No timed slot is held; KF3 is writing D.

## KF3: D accepted; KF3-B1 and KF3-B2 routed; PR to review (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

- **D is accepted, and committed on the KF3 branch as `b8c55c92e`** (records only; the code equals `ae831ca51`'s). It holds RETURN (sha256 `a582135f…`), CHANGE_RECORD (`b9fca3a6…`), `_run_records/{b,d,h,merge}/` and SHA256SUMS (115 entries, verified by ROOT).
- **The write set is confirmed by ROOT against main:** FK's facade line (the merge ruling), `K4R/{adaptive,bound,verify,wide_sum}.rs` (`wide_sum.rs` under ruling 7), K4T's tests, GEN and `kf3.txt`, and H's `staged.rs` and `k6b_w1.rs` (the parity ruling).
- **KF3-B1 (the TREE frames' `Ceiling`) is classified:**
  - Estimate (b) rejects on member 1's end force at the root. Its ratio Ŵ/(2^(6−P)·ê) is independent of P, so no precision passes, as with THIN.
  - I19's probe of R1's comb tree (AX) gives c = 64 × ratio:
    - 20.5 at 1,000 members and 25.3 at 2,000 (both selected);
    - 74.1 at 3,000, 64.8 at 4,000, 142.9 at 6,000 and 177.1 at 8,000.
  - **At 3,000 and 4,000 members this is slack in (b):** R7's Corollary would still hold (c ≤ 127 at p = 128 and 256).
  - **At 6,000 members and above, it is beyond what R7's split of λ = 2^8 leaves for (b)** while (d) keeps 60. That is a design limit of the split, and 10,000 members is taken to be the same, by extrapolation.
  - **Routed:** a D1 design question: re-splitting λ between (b) and (d), and whether (b) can be sharpened on tree roots. It is not KF3's, and not a T3-close blocker.
  - **Owner-facing:** W1a publishes no retained-precision result for R1's large trees at about 3,000 members and more. The binary64 route publishes them with its ordinary class, as today. This joins THIN on the owner's availability list, beside the PHYS-R4 question.
- **KF3-B2 (heap above E_max) is a K6b omission, not KF3-induced.**
  - Against K6b's final formula, the peak inside `nl_pass` on the shifted factor at 1024 (bound.rs:1040) exceeds E_max by 19.5 MB (AX) and 19.4 MB (ROT). [Correction (ROOT, 2026-09-30, RV25-S1): that comparison is not like for like. It sets `vk_scale`'s measured peak against K6b's E_max with `k6_observe`'s fixed term. On `vk_scale`'s own fixed term, K6b's final formula **bounds** both measured peaks, by 7.0 and 7.5 MB (KF3 RETURN §13); that fixed term is itself an estimate. KF3-B2 stands on the code derivation alone: H's pass term under-counts the 1024 shift by a net 10,799,688 B (`at`/`bt`/`ct` omitted, `work` counted after it is freed, `OPTION_EXTRA` over-counted), so E_max is not yet shown to bound that phase. On main the call is at `bound.rs:1059`. The routing to K6c is unchanged.] [Correction (ROOT, 2026-09-30, RV25-D1): the finding is stronger than this bracket says. By construction, K6b's formula does not bound this phase: taken from the code, the phase needs 3,021,565,490 B (AX) against E_max 3,010,765,802 B (KF3 RETURN §13, :440-445). Only a *measured* excess is unshown; the `vk_scale` peak stays inside E_max through slack elsewhere, not through this term.]
    - H's pass term leaves out `at`, `bt` and `ct` (3·nf·w).
    - It counts `work`, which is freed before `nl_pass`.
    - It over-counts `Option<Wide>` by 8 B per entry.
    - Net, it is short by 10,799,688 B at the 1024 shift.
  - Pre-KF3 code holds the same allocations on the same path. KF3 only makes the path reachable (A2's shift, where Uc used to stop the attempt at 256).
  - I19's B-time reading ("two profile copies") described VR's stale port, not K6b's formula; the correction is recorded in RETURN.
  - **Routed to a K6b follow-up (K6c), a small H PR with its own review, after KF3 merges:**
    - E_max's pass and shift terms corrected;
    - the overlap of `uc_bounds`' transients checked;
    - `counts.jsonl` regenerated;
    - W1-T4 re-run on the post-KF3 code (RETURN addendum 1's content);
    - **VR's stale E_max port** (`VR/src/scale.rs`, 153 MB below K6b's final formula; V-K's runner admits with it) replaced by K6b's estimate, deduplicating it.
  - **ROOT's W1 limits wait for K6c.**
- **T9 and the both-entry gate stay unrun for KF3.** `retained_api` is public in FK, but no product crate names it (the V-K and K6b scans). KF3's product-crate reach is unchanged; the reviewer re-runs the scan.
- **KF3's stale doc NOTE** (`H/src/bin/k6_observe/w1.rs:6-10`) goes to K6c.
- **The PR is opened** from `b8c55c92e`, with its full-SHA dispatch. **RV23 is the independent reviewer,** directed to:
  - A2's honesty argument, against every reader of Uc, S and B;
  - the partial-stage identity on all four builds;
  - the controls' invariance;
  - KF3-UC-SPAN's honesty against GEN;
  - the H parity update;
  - B's records.
- **DEC-025 and GEN-8 run on the final head after RV23.**

## K6c briefed; V-K's V3 addendum satisfied by KF3's B (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

- **K6c's brief is committed:** `TASK_BRIEFS/I21_K6C_IMPLEMENTATION.md`. It covers:
  - E_max re-derived phase by phase against the post-KF3 kernel and corrected (KF3-B2);
  - VR's stale port deduplicated;
  - W1-T4 re-run post-KF3, as K6b's reserved addendum 1, in `T3/IMPLEMENTATION/K6C/`, since K6b's records are hash-bound;
  - KF3's stale-doc NOTE;
  - RV22's C-N1 if it fits.
- **I21 is spawned after KF3 merges.** Its base must carry KF3's kernel.
- **V-K's routed V3 re-run** ("V-K merged", Routed) **is satisfied by KF3's B.** B ran V-K's runner and `vk_scale`, unedited, on `e114b23c1`, whose FK equals KF3's final head `b8c55c92e`'s. It covers V1 to V3, outcomes and R1 honesty (`KF3/_run_records/b/`).
  - The E_max column in those records comes from VR's stale port. It is superseded by K6c's corrected estimate. K6c re-checks B's admission decisions against the corrected estimate; ROOT has not verified them. [Correction (ROOT, 2026-09-30, RV25-N2): as first written (`e48774292`), the previous sentence ended "…, and no admission decision there relied on it at the margin". That was an unverified claim, replaced in place 12 s later (`ffc489f52`) with no bracket. The bracket is added here.]
- **ROOT's W1 limits wait for K6c's merge** (the corrected E_max and the post-KF3 W1-T4).

## KF2: checkpoint A accepted; B granted (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

- **A is accepted, and committed on the KF2 branch as `1b10121fa`.**
  - **The code:** FKS's `negative_pair_witness` now delegates to the private `negative_pair_witness_counted`.
    - ROOT read the diff. The guard repeats `verify_negative_direction`'s arithmetic cell for cell, in its order, and only a witness verdict builds a direction and calls the unchanged verifier.
    - There is one test-module line (Q1) and one site-table row (Q5).
  - **The tests:** the differential tests against verbatim reference copies (n = 2 to 100) pass, with 142 witnesses, 98 no-witness cases, and all 9 exact allowance ties found. The count tests pass, and 11 mutants are killed.
  - **N10's two models** (6,006 DOFs, dense, through H's unchanged `k6_observe` in release):
    - each ends in the factor's refusal (DOF 6001 and 6002, after about 66 s);
    - the witness takes 0.94 s and 0.91 s and finds no pair;
    - each process exits at about 203 s, where before they were killed at 1,800 s.
  - **Suites:**
    - FK 415 (1 ignored: the release cost test), site table 3, SD 30, NI with SA 134, and H 74 with `k6_alloc`;
    - PP passes except the known Mac platform test `t13`, which fails identically on the base.
- **B is granted now:** T9, the both-entry gate and the src-tauri suite, as the brief's "Gates" and F1b's (`I13_F1B_IMPLEMENTATION.md`) define them.
  - **T9:** 112 of 112 byte-identical, plus F1b's extra corpus (16), from `git archive` copies of base `78f55f927` and candidate `1b10121fa`.
  - **Gate part 1:** 884 runs on the candidate, **against a fresh Mac run of base `78f55f927`**, with P1's probe and the calibration's heap cap. PASS needs:
    - every run byte-identical to the base (envelope sha256 per case, mode and entry);
    - 0 trusted breaches;
    - no heap-cap abort.
    - FK has changed since F1b's gate, in paths the product does not reach, so a fresh base keeps the comparison unambiguous.
  - **Gate part 2:** the four dense N10 runs (both entries), candidate only.
    - Each must end within 1,800 s, with its outcome recorded. The expected outcome is the factor's refusal on both entries, since the witness finds no pair.
    - The base's timeouts are already recorded (F1b's gate and K6's B2).
    - The class disagreement with sparse (Sensitive) remains, and is the split-out screen slice's.
  - **The src-tauri suite,** as F1b ran it (`F1B_MERGE/src_tauri/`).
  - **Host:** one cargo job at `-j 4`, the memory guard running, and no timing compared. RV23 (KF3's reviewer) is building beside it, which is allowed.

## KF2: checkpoint B accepted; D now (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

- **B is accepted, and committed on the KF2 branch** (`_run_records/b/`, SHA256SUMS `247459f7…`, verified by ROOT). It ran on this Mac, with base main `78f55f927` and candidate `1b10121fa`, as `git archive` trees that differ only in KF2's three FK files.
  - **T9:** 112 of 112 byte-identical, and F1b's extra corpus 16 of 16. The base also equals the platform calibration's Mac hashes.
  - **Gate part 1: PASS against a fresh base run.**
    - All 884 runs are identical: outcomes, exit codes, summary and full envelopes (818 each), and error text.
    - `gate_check` finds 0 trusted breach triples on both sides, and there is no heap-cap abort or timeout.
    - Sixteen dense runs reach the witness (FX-NP-A-ulp-* and the four r1e-12 cases). The witness finds no pair, and they are byte-identical to the base.
    - ROOT checked the two uncommitted 606 MB `runs.jsonl` files against their recorded sha256 (base `c42981e5…`, candidate `11dfe829…`). They stay in `<wt>/scratch/i20/b/gate/`, as F1b's did.
  - **Gate part 2:** the four dense N10 runs, both entries, end in the dense factor's refusal (`NUMERICAL_INTEGRITY_UNRESOLVED`, DOF 6001 and 6002) in 67–68 s each. They were previously killed at 1,800 s.
  - **src-tauri:** 116 passed, as in F1b's run.
- **D now:** RETURN, CHANGE_RECORD and SHA256SUMS. Then ROOT opens the PR with its dispatch.
- **I20's scratch** (`<wt>/scratch/i20/b`, `<wt>/kf2-target`) is kept until KF2 merges, for its reviewer.

## KF3: rulings on RV23's review (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

RV23 (`REVIEW/KF3_REVIEW.md`, sha256 `96060f9e…`; records `REVIEW/_run_records/kf3_review/`) reviewed head `b8c55c92e`: **PASS**, with 0 BLOCKING, 1 SHOULD-FIX and 5 NOTEs. RV23 found no way for A2 to publish a wrong value.
- **A2's honesty:** every reader of B goes through `certificates`/`certified`, and blocks are contiguous, so no pass reads another block's rows. RV23 built three oracles of its own:
  - synthetic multi-block refusals, where B ≥ the exact norm and B = min over the formed bounds;
  - 52 forced-refusal W1 runs on 16 controls;
  - KF3-UC-SPAN in closed form.
- **The partial-stage identity:** 0 mismatches over 3,611 W1 runs with case limits on 11 models, and over 2,011 on H's model.
- **B:** reproduced byte for byte on CHAIN-n10000-AX and TREE-n10000-AX.
- **Reach:** no product crate names `retained_api` or `retained`.
- **Mutants:** 18 plus NONE, of which 15 are killed and 3 survive (RV23-N1's M4b, and the two equivalents in RV23-N4).

**Rulings:**
- **RV23-1 (SHOULD-FIX): fix it before merge.** Carry the refusals out on the error path.
  - **The defect:** a refusal recorded in the verification's shared build (`uc_bounds`), or in `shift_schedule` (S), must reach `AttemptRecord::bound_refusals` even when a budget stop follows it in the same build. Today it is dropped after `vs?` (`adaptive.rs:3028-3030`).
  - **The test:** RV23's probe (KF3-UC-SPAN with the case limit 1 to 100 LME short of the shared build's total) must record the refusal on the `Failed(Stop(Budget(Case)))` attempt. Add a test for each of the two sites, and a mutant for each.
  - **No outcome, row, class, bound or work count may change;** evidence only.
  - The claim "on every path" in the `AttemptRecord` doc, RETURN §3.1 and CHANGE_RECORD then holds as written.
- **RV23-N1: add the test.** Precedence in `verify_state` (a refusal stop outranks `uc`) gets a test that kills M4b. It is cheap, and the rule is a ruled decision (plan §11 item 2).
- **RETURN §12's wording** (RV23's routing check): "c is a property of the model" holds only where (b) binds. Correct it in a RETURN addendum; the routing is unchanged.
- **RV23-N2, N3, N4 and N5 are recorded,** with no change. N5 is already routed to K6c.
- **Then:** RV23 confirms the new head. After that come CI with the dispatch, DEC-025, GEN-8 and the merge.

## KF2: D accepted; PR to review (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

- **D is accepted, and committed on the KF2 branch as `f2b8c85a2`:** RETURN (`fe19dbc6…`), CHANGE_RECORD (`1457a990…`) and SHA256SUMS (`5b51af43…`, verified by ROOT). The code diff against main is exactly the three FK files.
- **The PR is [#1060](https://github.com/sgttomas/chirality/pull/1060),** with the full-SHA dispatch 36664104717 (target_base `78f55f927`).
- **RV24 is the independent reviewer,** directed to:
  - the equality argument, errors included;
  - the differential tests' coverage and the reference copies' fidelity;
  - the mutants;
  - B's records: T9, the gate's two parts and src-tauri;
  - the callers' reach;
  - the screen diagnosis, as a claim check only.
- **Then:** CI, DEC-025 on the final head, GEN-8 and the merge.

## KF2: rulings on RV24's review (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

RV24 (`REVIEW/KF2_REVIEW.md`, sha256 `6785aa13…`; records `REVIEW/_run_records/kf2_review/`) reviewed head `f2b8c85a2`: **PASS**, with 0 BLOCKING, 1 SHOULD-FIX and 5 NOTEs.
- **The equality holds.** RV24 read the code line by line against the base. Its own differential harness, whose oracle is a verbatim copy generated from the base's bytes, found 0 differences in debug and release. It covered:
  - 24,000 corrupted systems, with errors before and after witnesses;
  - 2,864 built systems;
  - 134,400 steps around the verdict's crossing;
  - skewed pairs and 29 adversarial cases.
- **I20's reference copies are verbatim,** apart from the names and a dropped `pub`.
- **B's records hold.** RV24 checked the uncommitted `runs.jsonl` hashes: only the time and memory fields differ over 884 records. RV24 rebuilt the probe from its own archives: a 20-run sample is byte-identical, an instrumented head matches 860 of 860 part-1 runs (10,000-member runs excluded under the host rule), and N10 CHAIN-ROT reproduces, with all 17,997,000 pairs visited.

**Rulings:**
- **RV24-1 (SHOULD-FIX): add the tests before merge. It is test-only.** Three single-edit regressions of the guard survive the committed tests and are killed only by RV24's harness:
  - the coupling cells swapped (RV24-M1);
  - the source cell transposed (RV24-M5);
  - the allowance charged for four cells whatever `terms` is (RV24-M4b).

  I20 adopts RV24's cases (`_run_records/kf2_review/`):
  - the asymmetric-source error-order cases;
  - a skewed edge scan;
  - edge scans for 2- and 3-term pairs.

  Each of the three mutants must then be killed by the committed tests. No product file other than the test file may change.
- **RV24-N1:** the two equivalent mutants are recorded.
- **RV24-N2:** the witness also runs on the `sparse_interactive` route (SA:2017 serves both modes), in the nonlinear loop (NI `lib.rs:1990` and `:2013`) and in SD:37. The caller list is complete and the signature unchanged. **ROOT amends the PR text to name these routes.**
- **RV24-N3:** no T9 output reaches the witness, so T9 is an invariance check only. B's SUMMARY misstates the eight captured-entry FX-NP-A runs, which publish a recovered result, not the refusal. The correction goes in a RETURN addendum, since B's records are hash-bound.
- **RV24-N4:** plan §7's screen claims check out. RV24's notes are carried to the split-out dense-screen slice:
  - measure the refusing rows' pivots;
  - enumerate class changes by running, not by prediction;
  - treat the published `operation_count` change as a contract note.
- **RV24-N5:** the cost reproduces (0.966 s at n = 6,006; the old search grows about ×16 per doubling). Recorded.
- **Then:** RV24 confirms the new head, then CI, then DEC-025 on the final head, then GEN-8 and the merge. If KF3 merges first, KF2 merges main, and RV24's confirmation includes a merge check.

## KF3 and KF2: review fixes committed; confirmations requested (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

- **KF3 `aa83f6796`** (by I19; RV23-1 and RV23-N1):
  - **The fix:** the caller owns the refusal slots, so a stopped build's Uc refusals and the S refusals kept when `shift_schedule` stops reach `bound_refusals`. It is evidence only.
  - **Tests and mutants:** RV23's probe, a swept three-block S test, and the `verify_state` precedence test. Six mutants are killed, including M4b.
  - **Suites:** FK 351 lib, 7 integration files and 6 doc-tests; `gen --check` 24 of 24.
  - **CI:** the dispatch is 36669370536. RV23 is confirming.
- **KF2 `1c7558df5`** (by I20; RV24-1):
  - **The change:** RV24's cases are adopted into `kf2_witness_tests.rs`, and RV24-M1, M4b and M5 are killed from clean archives. No product file changes. FK passes 417.
  - **I20 corrects RV24-N3's count:** 4 of the 16 witness runs (the captured-entry FX-NP-A runs) publish a recovered result, and 12 the refusal. RV24 checks this at confirmation.
  - **CI:** the dispatch is 36669470111. RV24 is confirming.
- **Merge order:** KF3 first, if RV23 confirms. KF2 then merges main, and RV24 adds a merge check.

## KF3: RV23 confirms aa83f6796 (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

- **RV23's confirmation at `aa83f6796`: PASS.** There is no new BLOCKING or SHOULD-FIX finding, and one new NOTE (`REVIEW/KF3_REVIEW.md`, "Confirmation at aa83f6796"; sha256 `0030aa39…`).
  - **RV23-1 is closed on both sites:**
    - the Uc probe now records `[block 0, Uc, Span, Backward, row 66]` on the budget-stopped attempt;
    - RV23's new two-case probe shows a cached non-budget failure passing its refusal to the later case;
    - RV23's three-block S sweep (799 case rooms) never loses, changes or invents a refusal.
  - **M4b is killed** by the new `verify_state` precedence test.
  - **Nothing else changed.** Every earlier probe re-runs byte-identical, apart from the refusals now recorded. FK's suite and `gen --check` pass on a clean archive, and product-crate reach is unchanged.
- **RV23C-N1 (NOTE) is recorded, with no test now.** The cache's refusal-keeping on a non-budget failure is shown by RV23's probe, but it is not covered by I19's tests. It needs a non-budget, non-refusal stop after a refusal, and FK has no hook to force one; honesty is unaffected.
  - **Routed:** if a fault hook for an `Arithmetic` stop is added (V-K's `mutation-controls` sites are the natural home), a two-case test goes with it.
- **The merge path:** CI on `aa83f6796` (dispatch 36669370536), DEC-025 (running now), GEN-8, then the merge.

## KF3 merged (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

- **Merged:** [PR1059](https://github.com/sgttomas/chirality/pull/1059) at head `aa83f6796`, merge `dd61120ff`, 2026-09-30 05:28:58Z. The merge record is `IMPLEMENTATION/KF3_MERGE/RECORD.md`.
- **The gates, on `aa83f6796`:**
  - RV23 PASSED the review and confirmed the head;
  - hosted CI was green, and the dispatch (36669370536) succeeded;
  - DEC-025 was clean: the only changes are frame_kernel 402 → 417 and harness 74 → 75, exactly KF3's added tests;
  - GEN-8 passed.
- **Disclosed: ROOT merged without first checking that main had moved** (to `45ffd91d1`, PR #1061). The check made right after shows that #1061 changes only `projects/chirality-app-v4/**`, and that the merged piping, `tools/` and `.github/` trees equal the gated head's byte for byte. The gates therefore cover what merged. The lesson is added to the handoff's §7.2.
- **Next:**
  - KF2 has merged main `dd61120ff` as `522167ac6` (clean; `structural.rs` is main's plus exactly KF2's delta). RV24's merge check, CI and DEC-025 are running.
  - K6c spawns after the pause, on a base that carries KF3.

## KF2 merged (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

- **Merged:** [PR1060](https://github.com/sgttomas/chirality/pull/1060) at head `522167ac6`, merge `7ad3a9adf`, 2026-09-30 06:08:13Z. The merge record is `IMPLEMENTATION/KF2_MERGE/RECORD.md`. ROOT checked immediately before the merge that main had not moved from `dd61120ff`.
- **The gates:**
  - RV24 PASSED the review, confirmed `1c7558df5`, and passed the merge check of `522167ac6` with no findings;
  - B's T9 (112 of 112), gate part 1 (884 of 884), part 2 (four runs in 67–68 s) and src-tauri (116) pass;
  - hosted CI was green, and the dispatch (36673660523) succeeded;
  - DEC-025 was clean: the only change is frame_kernel 417 → 432 plus 1 ignored, exactly KF2's added tests;
  - GEN-8 passed.
- **Routed:** the dense-screen slice (with RV24-N4's notes), and the dense cancellation note to T6 and T9.

## Records PR #1062: rulings on RV25's review (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

RV25 (`REVIEW/RECORDS_PR1062_REVIEW.md`, sha256 `45b27642…`; records `REVIEW/_run_records/records_pr1062_review/`) reviewed head `b0e357985`: **PASS**, with 0 BLOCKING, 2 SHOULD-FIX and 10 NOTEs.
- **What held:**
  - **Scope:** 1,031 paths, all under `_Coordination/`; the remerge diff is empty.
  - **Append-only:** one insert-only "[Superseded …]" bracket; every other change appends.
  - **Hashes:** all 25 SHA256SUMS files verify.
  - **Leaks:** GEN-8 passes.
  - **The nine merge records** match GitHub and Git exactly, KF3's disclosed slip included.
  - **Figures:** 25 sha256 prefixes and more than 90 figures match their sources.

**Both SHOULD-FIX findings are fixed before merge, as for PR #1049. Each is a ROOT figure error:**
- **RV25-S1:** KF3-B2 was stated as a measured excess of 19.5/19.4 MB over K6b's E_max. That comparison is not like for like. On `vk_scale`'s own fixed term, K6b's formula bounds both peaks by 7.0 and 7.5 MB (KF3 RETURN §13). The finding stands on the code derivation of a net 10,799,688 B under-count at the 1024 shift.
  - **Corrected in place with brackets:** the KF3-B2 lines in "KF3: checkpoint B accepted" and "KF3: D accepted"; K6c's brief (its premise, and a like-for-like bar); the work graph's state paragraph; and the handoff §8.1. [Correction (ROOT, 2026-09-30, RV25-D2): the work graph's paragraph and handoff §8.1 are text new in this PR, and were reworded directly, not bracketed. This commit message said the same wrong thing.]
  - `bound.rs:1040` is noted as `:1059` on main.
- **RV25-S2:** V-K B's "0.82 GB" and "2.7 GB" were MiB/1,000. They are bracketed with VK RETURN §14.3's figures.

**The NOTEs:**
- **Fixed:**
  - N2: a bracket at the admissions sentence, and handoff §7.2 rewritten; the count is now seven;
  - N3: the dense factor's time, bracketed;
  - N4: "before `uc`", bracketed;
  - N5: the `REVIEW/_run_records/SHA256SUMS` exception added to handoff §6;
  - N6: the handoff's THIN credit, the line count and the §1.4 list;
  - N7: `sweep_kf2` is kept as the Mac baseline, and the handoff overrides KF2_MERGE's prune list;
  - N8: "APP" is replaced by `P/apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/lib.rs` in the work graph and the handoff.
- **Disclosed in the PR body:**
  - N1: the work graph's :62 carries RV16-D1's one-clause rewording, and the rulings append starts at "K6: rulings on I15's checkpoint-0 plan";
  - N9: whitespace in raw logs and 3 lines of `KF2_REVIEW.md`, and executable `.sh.txt` copies. The latter are already common on main, so they are left as they are.
- **N10, recorded here:** `K5_MERGE/RECORD.md` says its baseline's piping tree equals main `b37331092`'s. It differs by 741 records-only `_Coordination/` paths, and no product or test path, so the suites are unaffected. The hash-bound record is not edited.
- **Then:** RV25's delta check of the fix commit, then the merge.

## Records PR #1062 merged; T3 paused for the audit (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

- **Merged:** [PR1062](https://github.com/sgttomas/chirality/pull/1062) at head `7b59a1efc`, merge `490b75bd9`, 2026-09-30 07:10:41Z, with `--match-head-commit`. ROOT checked immediately before the merge that main had not moved from `7ad3a9adf`.
- **Review:**
  - RV25's review at `b0e357985`: PASS, with 0 BLOCKING, 2 SHOULD-FIX (S1 and S2, both ROOT figure errors, fixed in `18b625268`) and 10 NOTEs;
  - its delta check at `18b625268`: PASS, with NOTEs D1–D4, fixed in `7b59a1efc`; [Correction (ROOT, 2026-09-30, RV26-N10): D3 was fixed in the PR body, not in `7b59a1efc`. RV25's final review is sha256 `0ab9812e…`.]
  - its delta check at `7b59a1efc`: PASS, with no new finding.
  - The last delta check's section and records (`delta_7b59a1efc/`) are committed here, after the merge, as for RV16.
- **Hosted CI on the head:** 7 passed and 6 were skipped, as selected for a records-only change. GEN-8 passed at each head.
- **Main now carries:**
  - every T3 record through the audit pause;
  - the work graph's state at the pause;
  - `HANDOFF_2026-09-30_AUDIT_PAUSE.md` and its tools.
- **This section, and RV25's last delta records,** stay on numerics until the next records PR.
- **T3 is paused.** No agent is running, and no slice PR is open. On resumption, follow the handoff's §10.

## Operating notes for the pause; a second records PR (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

- **At the owner's request,** ROOT writes `OPERATING_NOTES_2026-09-30.md`. It succeeds the 2026-09-28 operating notes and complements the handoff: how ROOT ran each slice and checked agents' reports, the judgment calls, ROOT's own errors and the fix that works, the environment's quirks, working with the owner, and what ROOT would do differently.
  - The handoff and the work graph's pause paragraph gain a pointer to it; both are insert-only.
- **The owner chose to land it on main now,** through a small records PR with an independent records review (RV26). It carries this file, the pointers, and the numerics commits since PR #1062 (RV25's last delta check and "Records PR #1062 merged").
- **The notes are practice, not rulings.** Where they touch a ruling, this file governs.

## Records PR #1063: rulings on RV26's review (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

RV26 (`REVIEW/RECORDS_PR1063_REVIEW.md`, sha256 `60813369…`; records `REVIEW/_run_records/records_pr1063_review/`) reviewed head `21e2285e3`: **PASS**, with 0 BLOCKING, 2 SHOULD-FIX and 10 NOTEs.
- **Scope, append-only, hashes, leaks and GEN-8 all pass.** Every named finding and event in the operating notes matches its source.
- **Both SHOULD-FIX findings are fixed before merge, in the notes' own new text:**
  - **RV26-S1:** KF2's B "took a few hours" was another ROOT figure error. Its recorded runs span about 28 minutes. The notes now give the recorded figure and flag the error.
  - **RV26-S2:** the notes admitted one process slip; the records show at least four. The notes now list them.
- **The NOTEs:**
  - **Fixed in the notes:** N1–N7 and N5/N6's marking of statements that rest on session experience or on the owner's words in this session.
    - **N6:** the owner's words are not added to `OWNER_DIRECTION.md`. They are working preferences stated in this session, not directions, and the notes now say so.
  - **Insert-only on main's text:**
    - N7: the handoff's pointer is disambiguated;
    - N8: K6c's brief now requires mutant diffs;
    - N9: the handoff's prune inventory is completed;
    - N10: a bracket in "Records PR #1062 merged".
- **Then:** RV26's delta check, and the merge.
- **RV26's delta check at `95bb2e700`: PASS,** with 1 new SHOULD-FIX (D1) and 3 NOTEs.
  - **D1** is fixed in the notes: from K5 on, DEC-025 ran on each exact final head. On 2026-09-28, M03's and K3's sweeps were carried to a tests-and-records-only head, as their merge records disclose.
  - D2 to D4 are also fixed, in the notes and in the handoff's inventory line, which is new in this PR. The notes gain the next free numbers and a reviewer-prompt shape, since no reviewer prompt has been committed since RV13.
  - Then RV26's short confirmation, and the merge.
- **RV26's confirmation at `2a6f87562`: PASS,** with two optional NOTEs, C1 and C2. Both are fixed in the notes: C1 cites the M03 and K3 merge records' own justification of their sweep carry-over, and C2 corrects "RV19" to "RV14". RV26 confirms the fix, then the merge.

## Records PR #1063 merged (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

- **Merged:** [PR1063](https://github.com/sgttomas/chirality/pull/1063) at head `a2768ce49`, merge `74b3c7313`, 2026-09-30 12:48:09Z, with `--match-head-commit`. ROOT checked immediately before the merge that main had not moved from `490b75bd9`.
- **Review:**
  - RV26's review at `21e2285e3`: PASS, with 2 SHOULD-FIX (fixed) and 10 NOTEs;
  - its delta check at `95bb2e700`: PASS, with D1 fixed and D2–D4;
  - its confirmations at `2a6f87562` and `a2768ce49`: PASS, with C1 and C2 fixed.
  - RV26's last confirmation section is committed here, after the merge.
- **Hosted CI:** 7 passed and 6 were skipped, as selected for a records-only change. GEN-8 passed at each head.
- **Main now carries `OPERATING_NOTES_2026-09-30.md`** beside the handoff. T3 stays paused for the owner's audit.


## Audit accepted; bounded numerical recovery authorized (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

The owner reviewed ROOT's verification and recommendation, asked for the work-graph
account and Agent 0 orchestration plan, then directed: "Proceed accordingly."
The accepted plan and initial briefs are in RESUME_2026-09-30/. These are execution
briefs, not reusable instructions or acceptance of a new numerical design.

- **AUD-T3-01: accepted as SHOULD-FIX; open.** Subnormal row rounding before
  multiplication by L or division by L refutes the scale-transfer premise.
  ROOT reran the arithmetic and checked it by hand (verification/arithmetic.json).
  No unmutated false solver publication is established by the audit or preserved
  B01/B02 evidence. Such a witness makes this BLOCKING.
- **Explicit reliance hold:** F2a must not rely on the published-bound guarantee
  until the complete coupling argument, realized-source/control investigation and
  independently reviewed correction or proved exclusion close the finding.
  An amendment by ruling receives independent design-level re-derivation before
  reliance; the original A1 ruling does not discharge the missing premise.
- **Owner-selected direction:** bounded diagnosis and a conservative valid
  publication guarantee, with named refusal wherever it cannot be established.
  Extreme-model solvability is not the objective. No physical cutoff, new bound
  formula, D2 contract or availability change is selected here. Concrete changes
  to the published contract or supported domain return to the owner.
- **A2:** the audit and post-merge review sustain its conditional minimum-of-
  formed-certified-bounds argument. This is not universal runtime qualification,
  A1 closure or a memory-bound proof.
- **AUD-T3-02: adopt the replay erratum.** Original SHA256SUMS use their containing
  directory except REVIEW, DESIGN_NUMERICS, DESIGN_STANDING, REFERENCES and
  REFERENCES_ELOAD: each _run_records/SHA256SUMS uses its named parent.
  Preserve the original manifests.
- **AUD-T3-03: adopt the exception ledger.** S11-K, K2b and K6 disclosed
  intent-to-add/reset pairs; K6b disclosed fetch; S11-K's separate fast-forward
  was expressly authorized by its fix brief. Reported nil net effect does not
  establish no transient write or complete command-history compliance. ROOT
  owns every current Git/index mutation, including fetch and staging.
- **AUD-T3-04: accepted NOTE; preservation open.** Original Mac suite logs and
  KF2 gate JSONL are available; ROOT matched the latter to their original hash
  record. Preserve originals and sanitized recoverable copies before pruning.
  Local availability alone is not completed custody. K4's dated-generator-input
  and sparse-checkout limitation remains disclosed; no tooling repair is granted.
- **AUD-REV-N1: adopt input binding.** A script's constant BASE is not proof of
  its working inputs. ROOT's verification identifies the actual checkout, original
  script and principal input hashes, matched before replay. Preserve historical
  audit files and label changed-input analyses as new evidence.
- **PR #1064:** merged at 3bddc2b05f6106e969c7cf43373b230845c7cc66 before independent
  review. The later Response/instances/AUDIT-REVIEW/REVIEW.md at
  520d7dfb790bcedabc03e92b9692884ce295be54 confirms the defect, qualified as to
  reachability, with no blocking or SHOULD-FIX review finding. Its timing does
  not become pre-merge coverage or a future review waiver.
- **PR #1066 disposition authorized:** close unmerged, retain its branch and head
  520d7dfb790bcedabc03e92b9692884ce295be54. Its records are incomplete inputs,
  not numerical remediation or accepted design. Record actual closure after
  success. No guard development is carried forward.
- **Attribution correction:** the owner identified the supporting-tool drift and
  stopped the response. Its "ROOT's scope correction" wording must not obscure
  the owner's intervention. Old hash-bound records stay unchanged.
- **K6c remains required:** original I21 brief, full phase derivation, H/VR
  deduplication, final admissions and W1-T4 against the settled kernel. Sensitivity
  replay is not E_max proof; unsealed source_finish_01 is input only.
  ROOT's W1 limits wait for closure.

Response means the HELP-HUMAN-PIPING-20260930-T3-AUDIT-RESPONSE run under the
project coordination AgentRuns directory. Its REPLAY_AND_PROCESS_ERRATA.md
supplies the adopted errata with original evidence pointers.

ROOT retains Git, rulings, graph and host scheduling. A fresh WORKING_ITEMS manager
integrates I22/I21; the independent oracle and fresh reviewers report to ROOT.
TASKs make no Git/index writes or delegations. Initial grants are source-only;
actual parentage and scope are recorded at dispatch. Use the existing M5 guard.
A tooling blocker returns to ROOT and the owner.

After A1/K6c and W1 limits: F2a/S-G1, S-I, S-J where required, F2b per domain,
F3/S-G2/S-E1, V-P and join, plus T3-close obligations. Owner choices on ceilings,
PHYS-R4/availability, observation framing, KF3-B1 and KF2 dense screen stay open.
Every PR, records included, retains exact-final-head gates and fresh independent
review under the owner's current resumption direction.

## PR #1066 closed unmerged (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

ROOT closed PR #1066 under the owner's accepted disposition. GitHub reports CLOSED,
closedAt 2026-10-01T04:44:25Z, with head
520d7dfb790bcedabc03e92b9692884ce295be54. A fresh git ls-remote confirms the
response branch still points to that head. Nothing was merged or deleted.
Its numerical results, conditional designs, guard and unfinished K6c packet
retain the limits stated in the preceding ruling and scope handoff.

## Resumption dispatch and raw-evidence return (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

The native WORKING_ITEMS recovery manager /root/t3_recovery_manager and its
fresh I22/I21 TASKs are running source-only checkpoint work. ROOT's independent
oracle /root/a1_exact_oracle was stopped after it disclosed premature expected-
answer exposure; its only return is provenance, not an accepted oracle result.
A fresh /root/a1_oracle_fresh excludes old expected-answer/output records until
its independent derivation is frozen. DISPATCH.json and DISPATCH_UPDATES.jsonl
record parentage, supplied bases and scopes. No Rust experiment has been granted. [Correction (ROOT, 2026-09-30, RV27-S1): this describes the initial source-only dispatch. The later BRIEFS/I22_G0_BUILD.md in this records candidate authorizes one probe build only; no solver case or numerical acceptance is granted here.]

The preservation TASK returned a sealed packet in RESUME_2026-09-30/evidence.
ROOT verified its seal and file hashes and independently restored both compressed
gate files to their original recorded hashes (ROOT_EVIDENCE_CHECK.json).
The evidence README gives inventory, final-head bindings, transformations and
restore instructions. ROOT accepts the existing-policy size warnings for the
two canonical gate gzip copies; no storage tool or policy is changed.
This prepares Git recovery of sanitized logs and original gate bytes; independent
records review and remote integration remain pending. The original raw scratch
and current Mac baseline stay intact; no pruning is authorized. The generator-
input/sparse-checkout limitation remains separately disclosed.

The manager disclosed uncertainty about optional index stat-cache refresh from
its initial read-only git status commands. No explicit mutation was reported;
the record does not assert a complete no-write history. Subsequent delegated
Git reads require GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0. No index repair or historical rewrite
is authorized by this clarification.

- **Evidence location correction (same ROOT integration):** GEN-8 detected the
  literal scan patterns in the returned COMMANDS.md as an unclassified active
  surface. The complete sealed packet was relocated byte-for-byte to
  RESUME_2026-09-30/_run_records/aud_t3_04/. EVIDENCE_RELOCATION.json maps its
  original return prefix to the current one; the original seal is unchanged.
  No test, checker or sealed evidence text was edited. The first GEN-8 failure
  remains recorded; rerun is required before the records candidate merges.


## Records resumption: RV27-S1 corrected (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

RV27 independently reviewed candidate 90b6bcbbf64b13975211038bf3f33bb87273e646.
Its REVIEW.md is SHA256 8bb6773bfb27f2e11a3b4f2a2dd1e740cc92fcb8f1a74fcc4ca0792a619658f6,
under REVIEW/RESUME_RECORDS_RV27 on numerics. Its sole SHOULD-FIX, RV27-S1,
is corrected here: the current graph identifies initial source-only dispatch
and the later included G0 build-only authorization. The dispatch ruling retains
its historical words with an explicit correction bracket. This frozen records
slice contains no solver-case grant or numerical acceptance. ROOT verified
RV27's seal; the same reviewer must confirm this correction before merge.

## AUD-T3-01 escalated to BLOCKING: C17 source witness (ROOT, 2026-09-30)

ROOT read the unchanged C17 raw output, rehashed it and the G0 binary, checked
the independently frozen exact truth and recomputed the interval inequality.
The independent oracle TASK separately confirmed it without changing its frozen
truth or comparator. I22/c_01 and oracle_fresh/addendum_02_C17 preserve the result.

C17 is an admitted unmutated PrimitiveSource selected at p128/P256. D:0 and M:0
publish +0, AbsoluteVerified with bound bits 0000001000000000. Exact primitive
force balance gives 9*2^-1041 in model length units; b=2^-1038, so error/b=9/8.
Even b*(1+2^-22) is too small: the exact qualified ratio is 4718592/4194305.
These are two false kernel row publications, not merely a proof counterexample.

Raw stdout SHA256: 841167ed887a71b0e2a904647e1f217758fad304baaaf0d669f5c47035dc797a.
Binary SHA256: bcbe897204ec702b99529d25e6d0213d0132af5e6086e0397fae3a8f8ef8a08f.
Source: 3bddc2b05f6106e969c7cf43373b230845c7cc66, FK-identical to d01ad98...
The run uses the unchanged probe, no seeded feature, and the G2 fixed limits.
The source-level comparator and independent derivation are in the A1 worktree's
RESUME_2026-09-30 records; ROOT is preserving them as their own pinned Git basis.

AUD-T3-01 is BLOCKING under the audit's existing escalation rule. F2a reliance
remains held. C18-C24 are unrun; the C sequence stopped after this first witness,
with no repeat, source repair or new search. The corrected post-read path error
does not change any solver output. B remains honest within its recorded coverage.

No product/native false publication is established. The literal C17 numeric
transport is excluded by the current product magnitude profile; equivalent
product/unit exclusion is not proved. This qualification does not excuse a
false publication by the admitted kernel API.

A fresh HELPS_HUMANS design assignment now independently derives a warranted
correction and its contract/availability effects. A fresh design reviewer must
re-derive it before reliance. No new bound, cutoff or implementation is selected
by this escalation. K6c stays unaccepted and tied to the settled A1 kernel.

- **Durable C17 basis:** complete diagnostic/oracle/manager packets are committed
  and pushed on the retained A1 branch at a6b40d2d036acac556e28f28f5b482a4adb39333.
  RESUME_2026-09-30/C17_EVIDENCE_BINDING.json pins paths, raw/binary hashes,
  manifests, scope and restore method. The records PR now incorporates the
  blocking escalation before merge; earlier review confirmations cover their
  named historical candidates only. A fresh design agent is executing the
  committed bounded brief; no repair or design alternative is accepted.

## A1 certificate correction selected for bounded implementation (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT selects the sealed independent design and additive correction, after
RV28's independent re-derivation and VERIFIED backcheck. Source-qualified
identities/hashes are in RESUME_2026-09-30/BRIEFS/I22_IMPLEMENTATION_A.md.
RV28-1 is closed at specification level; its conversion-work note remains an
implementation/review obligation. This satisfies independent design checking
before reliance; it does not accept unimplemented code.

The selected correction certifies H=|actual published x-verification v|+E using
the complete existing R7 error formulas and prerequisites. Absolute rows require
H<=the unchanged b. Relative rows require the public decimal predicate and both
the exact and current binary64 tighter allowances. An uncertifiable candidate
escalates or refuses by name. Existing scale/class/bound bits and source domain
are not widened. [Correction (ROOT, 2026-10-01): the unchanged
quantity is the construction at the same selected candidate/floor, not equality
of old and new output bits. Escalation can activate the existing p512 floor and
change scales/bounds. ROOT_REPAIRED_B_FIELD_COMPARISON.json under
RESUME_2026-09-30/verification binds that effect to the old/new raw hashes;
values/ranges/classes remain equal for these B cases. No new public formula or
source-domain cutoff is selected.] Private upward binary64 radii accompany the identical certified
publication; they are not a new public receipt radius. The addendum pins SI
normalization/binding and later facade obligations.

This bare-b choice implements the owner's already accepted conservative-refusal
direction. Qualified intervals, outward public bounds/scales, input cutoffs and
reversal of protected availability remain unselected decisions. No fresh owner
approval is created for faithful implementation of this choice.

ROOT reserves M03-INTEGRITY-MP-v2 in the current kernel policy mechanism, keeping
the method token. Historical v1 records are not retroactively certified.
F2a/D2 recognition, final-row/unit/derived certification and runtime qualification
remain required before product reliance.

I22 may author only the four maintained files in the committed A grant, with
additive evidence. No build/test/solver/mutant or snapshot refresh is yet granted.
The source branch now carries current main at 0ce33d7e89a306cfc01f3ce29f421f4dbd02e716.
ROOT will verify the core diff/hashes, commission a fresh source reviewer and
run every required gate on the actual candidate before merge. A1 is still
BLOCKING, K6c unaccepted and F2a held.


## Audit resumption records merged (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

PR1068 merged at 2026-10-01T06:38:11Z as
546e05a159a58f5ceffe1d315373bc2f31982ea8, exact candidate
729e80b5c2a33b278623a850d9c75c25372b688c. ROOT checked main a38617d
immediately before the guarded merge. RV27's final independent confirmation,
full-SHA CI, exact-head Mac DEC-025 comparison (including the disclosed isolated
missing-suite recovery), and GEN-8 are recorded in
IMPLEMENTATION/RESUME_RECORDS_MERGE/RECORD.md. No numerical repair is accepted.
AUD-T3-01 remains BLOCKING, F2a held and K6c unaccepted. Original raw evidence
remains preserved; no pruning is authorized. The owner stopped the response drift.

## A1 first compile: bounded matcher repair (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

The B compile stopped before tests on two new-test type-inference errors and
one exhaustive existing test matcher. ROOT grants only the diagnostic
PublicationEnclosure arm in FK/tests/retained_k4/method_tests.rs as a fifth
maintained path, plus explicit Wide::<4> in the new tests. Existing expected
tokens/fixtures/assertions remain protected. The committed B compile addendum
sets the exact scope; this is no availability or numerical acceptance.

## A1 compiled-source checkpoint and reach (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT froze the exact compiler repair at dd1f70d8ba85b19f7d948bca6ee08a44bbb12ae1.
I22 implementation_b_fix_01 records the preceding successful focused tests on
3cf296e plus that exact patch; they are not falsely rebound to a later launch.
Full numerical/runtime/mutant acceptance is still pending. The C brief grants
finite source-control and new-test work, plus RV29's independent fixed-head FK
suite. No old expected outcome or protected availability is changed.

The actual caller trace, independently checked in RV29 candidate_01, reaches
H/validation only. The legacy product solver uses unchanged retained arithmetic
and seeded hooks, not the changed adaptive route. Accordingly T9/both-entry
are not triggered by this slice alone; all other standing exact-candidate gates
remain. Reassess if the source/write set gains product reach.

## Independent ledger span correction (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

RV29's candidate ledger understated the successful b=2 algebra route's aggregate
max_span_bits by one. ROOT and the manager independently checked the frozen
source: the comparison term span is 1-(-1074)+1=1076, while H alone spans1075.
The priced work and budgets do not change. The original sealed ledger stays
unchanged; RV29 provides an additive correction. The C span brief permits only
the warranted new-test expectation/rationale repair before the next bounded
run. This is no production defect closure or blanket permission to rebaseline.

## A1 S11 inventory: declare the added integer site (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

The full fixed-head FK suite found one source-inventory mismatch in addition
to the two legacy work-golden assertions. ROOT and RV29 classified the added
run_schedule c+=1 as the existing integer precision-schedule index advancing
after certificate rejection. The exact S11 inventory row may change5 to6 with
that annotation; all scanner rules/other rows remain. The dedicated committed
brief bounds the edit/check and same-reviewer backcheck. No floating summation
site or protected numerical criterion is excused.

## A1 checkpoint D: preserve old work oracles and close test gaps (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

The complete source-run/review evidence now warrants the exact test-only D grant
in RESUME_2026-09-30/BRIEFS/A1_CHECKPOINT_D.md. I22 may isolate the new certificate
component in the two named existing work-golden tests while keeping every old
numerical literal and unrelated criterion. This supersedes the earlier optional
evidence-patch-only step; the actual diff and same-reviewer backcheck remain
required. The independently checked relative-control fixture is accepted as
unit-level arithmetic truth, not a source-model result. No production change,
old fixture rewrite, new public formula or availability relaxation is selected.
A1 and K6c retain their separate closure boundaries under the owner's sequence.

## A1 VR records: include certificate work (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

The unchanged kernel-lane generator on immutable40129 produces only the five
accounting-field deltas documented in RESUME_2026-09-30/verification/
vr_record_refresh_01/FIELD_DIFF.json on A1. ROOT checked all field comparisons
and charge closure. Accuracy, outcomes, precision, classes, controls and
not-covered expectations stay fixed; invariance/parity records are identical.
The ten generated family JSONs and kernel_lane/SHA256SUMS may be refreshed to
include the new certificate work. No other observation or criterion is granted.
The failed preflight and original hashes remain evidence. Same-reviewer
backcheck and an affected-suite rerun are required; this is not A1 closure.

## A1 historical fault mappings selected for bounded replay (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT read I23's exact patches and RV29 protected_06. The precise selected subset
and runtime fences are in RESUME_2026-09-30/BRIEFS/A1_G1_PROTECTED.md. Reconstructed
A2 patches retain original IDs without claiming missing original bytes. D4u's
current underflow-only variant preserves both old overflow assertions and must
reach the old underflow criterion. This selects a faithful finite discriminator,
not a weakened expectation or an executed kill.

The historically optional RV23C-N1 cache probe remains optional: independent
source comparison confirms its failure path unchanged. R7 derivation/retired
and RV23-N4 reachable-path qualifications remain their sourced dispositions.
All other unreviewed or masked mappings remain open; the new certificate's mere
refusal is not evidence that an intended old numerical assertion was exercised.
No design contract, availability claim or A1 closure is accepted here.

## G1 host-tool stop; owner direction required (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

G1 passed all selected unmutated baselines, then stopped before any mutant
execution. The existing system patch command reported a system temporary-file
permission error while returning exit0. The mandatory postimage check found
the original source unchanged and prevented continuation. Exact command, raw
hashes and expected/actual source hashes are in
RESUME_2026-09-30/I22/protected_g1/runtime_01 on A1. No kill or survivor is claimed.

The owner's explicit instruction to stop and report tool blockers governs.
No TMPDIR or permission change, retry, alternative patch mechanism or host-tool
development was performed. ROOT requested direction for a bounded trial of
the existing apply_patch tool on the already frozen G01 patch, with no host
configuration change. That question is pending; no approval is assumed.
Further experiment work is held. Existing source-only returns and evidence
preservation may finish, with no new host jobs.

E1/E2's new-publication variants have independent RV29 runtime confirmation,
and the full FK and H/VR preflights passed. This is not A1 merge acceptance:
historical fault work and final-head gates remain, draft PR1070 stays unmerged,
F2a is held, and K6c has no accepted complete E_max.

## Owner resumption and bounded patch retry succeeded (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

The owner directed: “Please resume and carry on as you intended.” ROOT stated
and acted on this as authorization for the previously requested ten-minute
existing-apply_patch retry. G01's exact frozen postimage, intended Phi assertion
failure and both untouched controls passed their required checks; evidence is
RESUME_2026-09-30/verification/tool_resume_01 on A1. No host configuration,
permission, environment or tool development occurred. Prior failed evidence
remains sealed. The operational hold is lifted prospectively for bounded work;
A1 remains BLOCKING pending final verification/merge, F2a held, K6c unaccepted.

## K6c narrow layout bindings independently checked (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT read I21 layout08_run and RV30 layout08_03/backcheck_run and verified
their seals. The actual three kernel node-request pairs and five named type
size/alignment facts are usable in the conditional kernel ledger on their
exact immutable40129/Rust1.97.1/aarch64 release basis. RV30 independently checked
the complete raw samples, source/build/binary and no-extra-allocation/drop
conditions. Source_07's queue recurrence is also independently checked.

This is deliberately narrow: no private node alignment is inferred, the
process subtraction baseline is not an allowance, and no complete E_max,
admission or W1 acceptance follows. C1/C2/O2/W1 remain open. No allocator,
observer, guard, dependency or maintained code was changed. Later final-source
reconciliation and full-bound review remain required before reliance.

## K6c H caller composition reviewed conditionally (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT read I21 source_10 and RV30 h_caller_05 and verified both seals. The
finite application-owner composition, grammar and sample-edge distinctions
are usable as conditional terms. RV30 found no blocking defect in that scope.
Adopt its N1 geometry-leaf narrowing and N2 registered-allocator boundary:
the remaining floating-format premise does not require a general geometry
error audit, and private Thread layouts are not a K6 requested-byte obligation.
The original source_10 packet remains unchanged; the review is additive.

H-R0 is only surviving registered owners and later reached growth on the finite
main-thread path; H-R1 is the selected stdout mutex child; H-R2 is the directly
reached byte-write/flush path and dropped errors; H-F0 is finite default-f64
Debug. Planned path/model inputs and checked final implementation remain to
bind. These are precise open premises, not free estimator inputs or measured
allowances. No full E_max, prelaunch admission, W1 or F2a acceptance follows.
VR's finite caller composition continues separately under its source-only brief.

The source_10 and h_caller_05 records cited here are on the separately preserved
K6c branch at `79ab5428470ca747a484ea145ea979e5bb965c96`, under
RESUME_2026-09-30/I21/source_10 and source_review_RV30/h_caller_05.
Their presence on that branch is not a merged K6c implementation.

## A1 completed verification subsets and exact-tail correction (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT read and verified RV29 g1_final_12, g2_runtime_13 and g4_runtime_14.
Those selected subsets are closed with their precise assertion/control and
source/build qualifications. Counts and exceptions remain at their REVIEW
sections; the extra G01 baseline and all uncredited operational attempts are
preserved. This is not complete historical coverage or A1 acceptance.

G3's R09/R10 whole-loop attempts stopped at earlier corpus rows and receive
no credit for the explicitly required witnesses. Their original controls were
subsequently run under separate grants. The additive diagnostics retain the
same rows, original upper expectations, production faults and original test
prefix. RV29 tail_sources_15 corrected both I23's and its own earlier prediction
arithmetic because ExactWideSum.used includes spare zero limbs. Correction11
and tail_correction_16 preserve those errors and change only the predicted
fault behavior/eligibility: R09 yields +8p0 directly; R10 yields Z+.
No protected unmutated expectation, criterion or original corpus changed.

The original G3 window was closed at its quiescent R14 boundary. ROOT selected
the bounded reuse of existing source checks before Cargo, retaining postchecks,
then independently reviewed that exact helper delta and preparation seals.
Each remaining copy still needs its own manager-issued conditional release
and an immediate hard source/binding check before build. Sequential semantic
inspection, controls and stop rules remain. No new host guard/tool was built.
Fresh runtime grants are in A1_TAIL_RUNTIME_AND_G3_REMAINDER.md; old deadlines
remain historical, and no automatic extension is granted.

## K6c direct-path proof and artifact request facts (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT read source13, metric_design_02, I23 private_request_artifacts_08 and
RV30 h_request_bindings_10. H12-F1's public Mutex/Once forwarding gap is closed
by the additive source proof. The two allocation arguments are usable only on
the review's exact layout08 executable basis: the named pal mutex and first
ThreadInfo registry leaf. See h_request_bindings_10 RETURN sections1–2 for
values, units, source attribution and native instruction evidence. They were
not inferred from the observed startup baseline or a mirror type.

The library archive-reader incompatibility was preserved and that lookup
stopped; the separately authorized existing executable supplied the evidence.
No runtime witness, library rebuild or tool replacement occurred. Final-H
specialization/build correspondence remains mandatory; this does not supply
a final-H or whole-process E_max bound. The direct witness proposal remains
unrun and unselected because existing executable evidence was available.

VR caller identities/schema conclusions remain conditional on their stated
construction/configuration premises. RV30 vr_caller_07 and serde_binding_08
plus external_inputs_06 supply the checked source, package-byte and input
bindings without a fresh canonical replay. V-EXACT derivation is separately
under review. Complete caller composition, checked implementation, final A1,
admission replay and measurements remain open; W1/F2a are not released.
These K6c packets are preserved at branch commit
8d80dbdb326514e167ccf16b8e173bd91c7441f4 under RESUME_2026-09-30.


## A1 named-witness continuity and K6c finite callers (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT read RV29 g3_prefix_tail_17 and the later preemption_18/r33_source_19
reviews. G3's prefix and corrected tail diagnostics are independently closed
as recorded in g3_prefix_tail_17; original earlier-case failures retain no
named-witness credit. Runtime04's R33 failure occurs on N01 before its named
N05/N06 witness, and remains uncredited. ROOT's runtime05 disposition permits
its unchanged original control and the remaining original schedule while an
additive N05/p128 diagnostic preserves the same helper and fixed oracle.
The exact conditional runtime grant is BRIEFS/A1_R33_NAMED_RUNTIME.md.
R51's source-only contingency is not an observed failure and stays unrun if
its original test qualifies. No numerical criterion or source expectation is
weakened; A1 remains open and F2a held until complete verification and merge.

ROOT read I21 source14 and RV30 finite_callers_12 and verified their seals.
The fixed-input floor inequalities and finite-from_f64 premise on the actual
vk_scale caller roster are usable conditional facts, with scope and figures
at finite_callers_12/RETURN.md sections “Actual basis and integer input check”
and “Actual observation routes and remaining138 rows”. The broader lane's
selected-numerator obligations remain open. A separate bounded numerical
consequence derivation has been assigned; finite tags and old passing runs
are not substitutes. No whole-process E_max or admission is accepted.

The K6c proposal and review are preserved on its branch at
4ee34724be3d4895016ba7ce9909f5e31a4770be. K6C's maintained adaptive.rs still
matches its own older committed KF3 source (Git blob5448ca262ab0346c138052e39b9a205b82739842),
with no working-tree modification. Its difference from the explicitly frozen
A1 basis is the not-yet-integrated A1 correction, not an unexpected source edit.
RV30 correctly reviewed the separately preserved full-hash-matched40129 bytes.
Final A1/build reconciliation remains required before implementation reliance.


## R46 historical-filter correction (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT read the original K4 review D.4, its RV19-D2 delta log and current source,
then I23 r46_diagnosis_14 and RV29 r46_diagnosis_22. The frozen fault is correct,
active and non-equivalent. ROOT's recovered focused-filter selection was wrong:
that focused unit test also passed in the historical run. The actual historical
kill was the unchanged classification-vector test's set19 equality. Restore
that existing discriminator under BRIEFS/A1_R46_MAPPING_DISPOSITION.md; no new
input, source, expected value or test is selected. The original survivor and
RV29's earlier mapping endorsement remain sealed; the diagnosis supersedes
only that endorsement. No kill is credited until the corrected run and controls
are independently checked. This is a recovery-mapping error, not evidence of
a new production accuracy defect. R33's separate named diagnostic may proceed
under its bounded grant; final G3/V-K/A1 acceptance remains open.

## K6c bounded numerator consequence and sparse correction (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT read the complete selected-numerator derivation and RV28's independent
selected_numerators_01/REVIEW.md, then verified both seals. Accept the bounded
source consequence on its exact fixed roster, immutable40129 source and inherited
accepted R7 premises. The review's sections “Full retained T/R implication” and
“Actual J-end recovery and rounded quotient” supply the warrant; “Every-row
result” supplies the exact arithmetic and figure basis. No successful selection
is promised. This closes the named remaining observation-finiteness premise;
changed inputs, recovery, row mapping or gates require reassessment.

ROOT also read sparse_13, metric_design_07_sparse_correction and RV30's
sparse_correction_14 return and verified their seals. SP13-F1 is closed by the
additive HFactor validation-owner correction. Reuse the original sparse proposal
only together with that correction and its review. The review demonstrates no
fixed-roster or composed-envelope undercount; its remaining private-node,
profile, formatting/runtime and final-build cells remain open.

These records are preserved on K6c at a900bcc69bbbc949214ff0be23bc073941332089.
They grant no complete E_max, implementation, admission, W1 or F2a acceptance.
ROOT selected one bounded canonical K0 assembly after the active serializer
review, through H's existing library and distinct H/VR caller terms. No contract
alternative from metric_design_06_closure_assessment is selected. The assembly
must expose exact residual cells and their numerical impact before any further
proof work is commissioned; BRIEFS/I21_K0_CANONICAL_ASSEMBLY.md governs.


## G3 execution complete; portable evidence placement (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT read and verified the runtime06 child/manager returns. Every remaining
G3 registration now has its required runtime evidence; independent aggregate
review is still pending. The earlier R33 and R09/R10 wrong-witness attempts
and focused R46 survivor retain no credit. Runtime06 preserves the original
window and ROOT's explicit prospective bounded continuation; no automatic
extension is inferred. R51's original named witness qualified, so its prepared
contingency remains unrun. V-K proceeds under its separate conditional grant.

The hosted interim head4972f4ef failed GEN-8 on machine-path provenance in
unclassified review JSON. ROOT read the failure, existing classifier and prior
relocation precedent; I23 independently diagnosed the records-placement cause.
Thirteen complete sealed review packets moved into source_review_RV29/
_run_records with every payload and manifest byte unchanged, recorded in
R/REVIEW_EVIDENCE_RELOCATION_2026-10-01.json on A1 at9ef9508dea.
[Correction to physical-path references in earlier records: apply that ledger's
old/new packet-prefix map for current replay. Pinned historical commits retain
original locations; internal packet-relative manifests remain unchanged.]
No checker, policy, source, oracle or numerical criterion changed. The unchanged
check passes on clean9ef9508dea; verification/gen8_portability_04 preserves the
result. Final-head GEN-8 and all other merge gates remain required.

ROOT read RV30 serializer_15 and verified its seal. Its finite schema/owner
recurrences are usable only with the named unresolved terms and the review's
refusal-argument/Phase.fields clarifications. The single K0 assembly actually
started17:51:15 UTC with a fixed18:21:15 end; manager/k0_assembly_16 records the
native dispatch. No further proof programme, estimator implementation, contract
alternative, E_max, admission or W1 acceptance is granted by that assignment.


## G3 independently closed (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT read g3_final_25/REVIEW.md and verified the whole-packet seal
 ea44ed6892482a455382ed9337697e92a3d553baa6c270bf014d66f24022ae08.
Accept its bounded G3 closure, including the exact registration/control
reconciliation, corrected historical R46 mapping, original qualified R51 and
both R52 predicates. Figures and qualifications are at its registration table
and full-command reconciliation; prior wrong-witness failures and the focused
survivor remain uncredited. RV29 also independently verified the complete
byte/mode/blob-preserving evidence relocation. The records are committed on
A1 at ab2d4ce9522d317a2310ca5545a719a8f8423367.

V-K remains active under its own bounded grant. This ruling supplies no final
A1, F2a, E_max or W1 acceptance; exact-candidate review and all final gates remain.


## Session-limit recovery checkpoint (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

The owner warned of an imminent session limit. ROOT is preserving the ongoing
authorized work and quiescent handbacks; this is not completion or a new owner-
approval hold. RESUME_2026-09-30/SESSION_LIMIT_HANDOFF_2026-10-01.md records exact
source/evidence reuse, branch/host recovery, open F03 contribution attribution,
remaining V-K/final A1 gates and unreviewed K6c proposals. No new experiment is
launched by this checkpoint. All prior numerical and acceptance holds remain.

ROOT read and verified RV29 vk_f01_runtime_28. Accept its separate release F01
numerical-unavailability witness within the stated scope; original debugP09
remains unqualified. P10's later control and F02 evidence await their own review.
F03's complete two-family observation restores controls but returns an explicit
contribution-attribution gap; it receives no fault credit at this checkpoint.
No generic Ceiling, Pivot location or seed name substitutes for its criterion.

K6c's latest prefix, formatting and eight artifact-specific node-pair returns
are preserved as proposals awaiting independent review. No complete E_max,
checkpoint0, implementation, admission, W1 or F2a acceptance is granted.


## Owner resumed T3; F02 and actual VR node facts (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

The owner explicitly directed “You may resume now.” ROOT verified the saved
M5/guard/process/Git state and restored bounded native work. Main546e05a was
already an ancestor of numerics, so no redundant merge commit or rebase was
created. RESUME_2026-09-30/RESUME_2026-10-01_1934.json binds entry checks and
supplied instruction origins. Old runtime deadlines remain historical; new
source/review grants are in the resumption briefs.

ROOT read and verified RV29 vk_mid_30. Accept F02's exact registered value
witness and P10/P12 controls within that review's scope. Its full F03 provenance,
controls and sequences are verified, but the source/soft-root consequence still
awaits independent review; P09/P13 retain unqualified status. The original
criterion does not impose an unrecorded universal reconstruction of every private
omitted term, nor permit a generic failure/enum to replace the named warrant.

ROOT read and verified RV30 vr_nodes_17. The eight actual leaf/internal pairs
are usable only on their separately bound release/debug artifact bases; see
its result table and “Build provenance and remaining limits” for units and
qualifications. Real source representation and typed allocation argument flows
supply those facts, not mirror layouts or equal-size type substitutions. Final
ordinary-production vk_scale correspondence and actual populations remain open.
The prefix and formatting proposals remain under independent review, with no
complete E_max, checkpoint0, implementation or admission acceptance.


## F03 attribution closed; honest runtime-plan supersession (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT read the complete designer source consequence and RV29
vk_f03_attribution_31/REVIEW.md, verified the seals and accepted its separate
release F03 outcome witness for BOTH registered families. Exact root-minimum
and material-decrease checks, CHAIN formed Rayleigh argument, SKEW linkage,
zero/tie qualifications and full runtime/control basis are at those sources.
The original whole-mutant criterion does not require a root-only counterfactual
or disclosure of every private omitted term. It still requires the proved
material soft-root link; generic Ceiling/Pivot/seed labels were not substituted.

P09/P13 remain unqualified debug attempts. Supersede P15 explicitly as UNRUN:
its RF-SKEW registration is covered by the independently qualified release
witness. P14 retains its actual debug rf_chain returned-control role. P16 runs
as a fresh debug rf_skew NONE baseline, never a return for unrun P15. Then
P17–P53 retain original order, predicates and controls under the fresh bounded
BRIEFS/A1_VK_REMAINDER_03.md grant. All old schedule/evidence bytes remain.
This does not close the remaining V-K matrix or final A1 gates.

## Prefix receiver correction and wrapped-error facts (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT read RV28's full prefix review, the additive correction09 and its same-
reviewer backcheck. [Correction (ROOT, 2026-10-01): the full backcheck read and
ROOT payload-seal verification occurred at19:55:57 UTC, immediately after the
original19:55:40 entry; that entry initially relied on the reviewer's sealed
handback summary. The subsequent full check agrees, with no changed verdict.]
RV28-PREFIX-1 is closed at source-design level: the fresh
free-DOF receiver and layout construction/growth coexist at the stated Counts
initializer edges, and all receiver temporaries die before the cut. Reuse
packet08 only with correction09 and the backcheck. The existing successful
single-main entry proof supplies its pre-args registered peak; final VR
correspondence and stated failed-startup/foreign/panic interfaces stay explicit.

ROOT read RV30 format_stream_18 and wrapped_errors_19 and verified their seals.
The finite formatter/hash/stream topology and the three actual request facts
are usable only within their reviewed source/artifact scopes. The conditional
wrapped-error substitution and units are in wrapped_errors_19's “Direct caller
and topology distinction”; it is not a process peak or final vk_scale fact.
Static-message pools remain under separate independent review. Complete K0/H/VR
numbers, checked implementation, final-build binding, admission and W1 remain
unaccepted; the next H numeric task is source arithmetic, not a new tool.


## V-K F17 criterion gap and conditional numeric candidates (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT read the full runtime05 child/manager returns and RV29 vk_completed_34
review, verified every manifest payload, and preserved them in A1 commit
1453a780bd. Accept only the reviewed P14/P16/P20–P26 scope and its distinctions:
P16 is a fresh baseline; P20 restores F04; F08/F10/F13 reach their registered
bitwise, canonical-byte and numerical predicates with actual returned controls.
All source figures and qualifications remain at that review's table.

Runtime05/RETURN.md records P28's successful original RF-WEAK return and P29's
missing RF-SKEW CLASS witness. Preserve the stop: P30–P53 are unrun. Neither
Ceiling nor FLOOR differences qualify for F17's protected CLASS criterion.
A source diagnosis and a separately reviewed, bounded existing-record diagnostic
are being prepared. They grant no acceptance amendment. Any measured conflict
requiring a protected-criterion change returns to the owner under project
AGENTS.md, Software checks. A1 acceptance/merge and F2a reliance remain held.

ROOT read manager/h_numeric_19/RETURN.md and the VR caller candidate's full
RETURN, SUMMARY and METHOD_AND_JOIN. Their source-arithmetic candidates are
preserved, not accepted E_max: H is under RV30 independent review; VR is under
RV28 review with five explicit kernel joins still outstanding. Numeric maxima,
units and conditional artifact/owner qualifications are at those source tables.
The binary half-heap check and calibrated runner admission are separate; no
chronological admission, required measurement or final production correspondence
is inferred. No supporting tool development is authorized.

Resumption check at20:38:18 UTC: actual M5 Max,18 cores,137438953472 bytes,
existing guard5387, no cargo/rustc process. Fresh origin/main remains546e05a159.
The remote PR1070 interim head2e1adc4015 has passing completed checks; that is
not final-head review/dispatch/DEC-025/GEN-8 closure. Maintained A1 code remains
at the reviewed40129 basis. ROOT retains all Git/index authority.


## Conditional H arithmetic verified; VR phase corrections pending (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT read and verified the full RV30 h_numeric_23/RETURN.md and h_summary_24
backcheck, with the additive h_numeric_summary_correction_01. Accept the H
numeric19 source/owner/arithmetic candidate conditionally on its stated ordinary-
production source/type/library/request-site/entry assumptions. H23-F1 and H23-N1
are closed. Exact byte figures and comparison bases are at h_numeric_23's
“Numerical result and historical boundary”; the MiB display is truncated and
not an outward-rounded upper. Actual Python floating products and both integer
conversions govern the projected-RSS summary, not an exact-real replacement.

This closes the conditional H arithmetic review only. Final artifact/profile
correspondence, maintained checked estimator, same-binary validation, corrected
chronological admission/ascent/RSS replay and W1-T4 measurements remain. No
complete E_max, K6c checkpoint0, run admission, W1 limit or F2a acceptance follows.

ROOT read and verified RV28 vr_numbers_06/REVIEW.md. Its two SHOULD-FIX findings
remain pending a bounded additive correction and same-reviewer backcheck:
retained failures during expected-list initialization and persistent typed LIST
during nonselected diagnostics. The review's “Exact numerical consequence”
proves both repairs are dominated by the existing common-outcome maximum on
the fixed roster; that does not make the original named phase addends complete.
The VR kernel join stays unreleased until those corrections are verified.


## Corrected VR caller interfaces accepted for bounded join (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT read the full metric_design_11_vr_correction/CORRECTION.md and RV28
vr_correction_07/BACKCHECK.md, verified their seals and all payloads, and accepts
the original caller candidate only together with the authenticated overlay.
RV28-VRNUM-1/-2 are closed. The corrected interfaces retain prior failure owners
and the initialized typed LIST at the reviewed phases; the common-outcome
maximum is unchanged on the fixed roster. Exact replacements, units and limits
are in that backcheck. This grants no implicit kernel value or complete E_max.

Release BRIEFS/I21_VR_KERNEL_JOIN.md for one bounded numeric composition and
like-for-like historical peak comparison. Ordinary-production correspondence,
checked implementation/deduplication, admission replay and required measurements
remain. A1's F17 owner-decision hold is unchanged and independently managed.


## Owner adopted the scoped F17 validation amendment (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

The owner answered “Approve the scoped F17 amendment (Recommended)” to the
explicit question recorded in RESUME_2026-09-30/OWNER_DECISION_F17_2026-10-01.md:
accept independently verified certificate rejection when A1 prevents publication,
preserve normal accuracy/class checks and reachable CLASS witnesses, and permit
the same rule for RF-CANCEL only after its own controlled run and independent
review. This is an actual owner decision, not inferred from elapsed time.

Adopt the exact independently reviewed scope in RV29
vk_f17_runtime_36/OWNER_DECISION_TEXT.md (review seal
a779da2a62c1fce29c0005e6e945ce785f1f76ea6e56d0b1303436bc5c284070;
A1 evidence commit80c35e37466435e408268eb19e037e56f5a787cf).
ROOT read the full review/proposal, verified every payload and accepts the
controlled RF-SKEW release result as certificate prevention after standing R7,
within its exact source/case/control scope. P30's actual debug return is closed.
P29 remains permanently unqualified with zero CLASS credit. The protected twist
rows were not observed: an earlier different force row prevented whole-case
publication. No per-row class witness is invented.

The original unmutated correspondence/exception lists, references, tolerances,
class checks and stored records remain. Actual CLASS evidence remains required
on registered not-covered comparisons outside prescribed exceptions wherever
publication reaches them. Only source-linked PublicRelative, SharperExact or
SharperBinary64 rejection in the reviewed relative branch after R7 can qualify
the alternative. Generic Ceiling, FLOOR/work/record drift, missing publication,
AbsoluteBound, malformed/terminal/budget/arithmetic/verification failure or
another fault receives no substitute credit. Unexplained attribution/control
failure remains a hold. Any changed source/corpus reopens affected warrants.

The same rule is prospective only for the remaining originally registered
F17 RF-CANCEL family on this unchanged A1 source. It grants no unrun credit,
no certificate bypass and no other fault amendment. ROOT separately releases
the prepared remaining original schedule. Complete V-K/A1, final-head gates,
merge, E_max, W1 and F2a acceptance remain open.


## RF-CANCEL F17 prevention qualified; remaining V-K resumed (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT read the complete RV29 vk_f17_cancel_37/REVIEW.md, verified its seal
2201dba8973e050e1da1e4dfd0049332ae494d51ecc5353a73c3eb546c7431ee
and every payload, and accepts its separate controlled RF-CANCEL observation
under the owner's already adopted F17-only certificate-prevention rule. The
report's “Actual release observation” and “Protected quantity distinctions”
state the exact case/attempt figures and what was and was not observed.
This applies the existing owner decision, without another amendment.

P31 remains permanently unqualified with zero CLASS credit. P32's actual debug
return is closed. The earlier different displacement row prevented whole-case
publication; no protected displacement/station class, H or later predicate was
observed. Normal frozen records and all original correspondence checks restore.
Together with the earlier qualified RF-WEAK CLASS witness and RF-SKEW prevention,
the registered F17 routes have their scoped dispositions and controls. No other
fault criterion is changed and no final V-K/A1 acceptance follows.

Close the stopped runtime06 and diagnostic windows. Release the remaining
original P33-P53 schedule only under BRIEFS/A1_VK_REMAINDER_07.md's fresh bound.
Final full candidate review and exact-head CI/dispatch/DEC-025/GEN-8 still apply;
AUD-T3-01 and F2a reliance remain held until actual A1 closure.


## Conditional VR composition and reference-profile interface (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT read the complete RV30 vr_join_25/RETURN.md, verified all payloads and
accepts the fixed-roster VR source/owner/numeric composition conditionally on
its stated profile, input and launch premises. The report's “Numerical and
historical result” supplies exact figures, units, comparison windows and
artifact qualifications. No observed peak supplies an arithmetic term. This
completes the conditional H/VR numeric candidates for their selected rosters,
not final E_max, implementation, artifact qualification or admission replay.

ROOT also read and verified the full metric_design_12_profile_binding proposal
and independent RV28 profile_binding_08 review. Select named immutable
ReferenceKernel/H/VRProfile premises with the existing external exact archive/
build/launch qualification. The earlier Verified-current-build factory was an
unaccepted sketch, not an adopted universal direct-CLI refusal policy. This
selection changes no protected test, ordinary CLI/CI behavior, admission
predicate, metric/window or solver contract and introduces no host tool.
Reference identities index conditional premises; they do not attest a current
executable or transfer M5/debug/seeded facts to Linux or ordinary production.
Unknown/mismatched artifacts receive no qualified reliance or measurement grant
at the external gate. No automatic in-process enforcement is claimed.

Implementation must keep each fact bundle and kernel/caller composition
coherent, reject missing/invalid descriptors rather than fill them with zero,
and preserve all existing executable, allocator and public-type checks.
ROOT's source read confirms VR's original scale test requires storage identities
and estimate ordering on its complete factored CI roster. Before implementation
release, a bounded adapter compatibility check will establish how the full
existing interface obtains its required descriptors without silently extending
the fixed-roster proof, keeping a stale estimate port or weakening that test.
The remaining qualification, checked implementation, admission and measurement
obligations are unchanged; no K0 implementation release is implied here.

## Required S1 survivor in the remaining A1 matrix (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT read and verified runtime07 child/manager returns. P33's exact VK-S1
rf_finite test survived and supplies no registered numerical witness. P34-P53
are unrun. The old runtime window is closed; no automatic retry, alternate
filter or later call follows. The F17 decision supplies no S1 substitute.
I23 has a bounded source-only diagnosis under the selected software-defect-
diagnosis skill; its return and independent review precede further action.
A1 acceptance/merge and F2a reliance remain held. No production fault is inferred
merely from the surviving test.


## S1 source mapping corrected, original numerical criterion retained (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT read and verified I23 diagnosis21 and RV29 vk_s1_mapping_38. The observed
P33 survivor is explained by the empty spring arrays in RF-FINITE, which make
the S1 site unreachable. The original maintained register required directional-
spring VALUE evidence and ran the broad suite; our later frozen A1 mapping
introduced the incorrect rf_finite restriction. Prior preparation/review missed
that source reach. Preserve that attribution and the original records.

Accept the independently reviewed source-ready correction to the existing
rf_skew test, which supplies a loaded nonunit direction and unchanged numerical
oracles. The review's source and exact fixture checks establish eligibility,
not a runtime kill. This changes no protected numerical criterion and imports
none of the F17 amendment. P33 remains an unqualified survivor. The separate
BRIEFS/A1_VK_S1_RETARGET.md grant permits only its actual P34 return and controlled
replacement triplet; later calls and A1 acceptance remain held pending results.


## S1 corrected VALUE witness qualified (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT read the complete RV29 vk_s1_result_39/REVIEW.md and verified seal
baee8b1fceccaad51c7ee7a322df4dabc096328ccb9ac6f459b6a95b54f3f6d5
and every payload. Accept the separately controlled rf_skew S1 observation
under its unchanged original numerical VALUE criterion. The report's “Every
witness checked” supplies exact counts, case/key/reference attribution and
source linkage. P34 and both new normal controls restore every original check.

P33 remains a zero-credit survivor caused by our earlier spring-free mapping;
no source/test/oracle/criterion or frozen historical record changed. No F17 or
nonpublication substitute is used. Close the S1 retarget window and release
only original P35-P53 under the fresh BRIEFS/A1_VK_REMAINDER_08.md grant.
Complete V-K/A1 and all final-head gates remain open.


## Complete-context API and five-field contract selected (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT read the full metric_design_13_api_contract contract and independent RV28
api_contract_09 review, verified all seals/payloads, and selects this conditional
interface design. Capture checked source facts before the existing source drop;
obtain input-history facts while the existing raw/typed owners are available;
keep coherent immutable reference profiles and external executable qualification.
The actual CLI remains RF-LARGE-only. The unchanged broader storage/order test
uses an explicit mathematical single-family reference invocation, not an asserted
CLI execution or bound on its load_all process.

Adopt the reviewed named model/fixed/decide/full/selected128 meanings and owner-
subset ordering proof. No +1, forced ordering, stale port, partial global value,
missing-cell zero, fixture exclusion or unqualified current-build assertion is
permitted. Every original test assertion and ordinary CLI/admission rule remains.
The review's six instantiation/translation cells remain real prerequisites; this
is not full adapter implementation or complete E_max acceptance.

Commission only bounded reuse/instantiation of existing generic equations and
fixed inputs: kernel terms on the required reference roster, each family's
caller/input composition and result mappings, and the reach-dependent triple-key
set premise. No new host tool or generic library proof programme is commissioned.
Unknown concrete facts must be returned by name; code translation and any added
allocation costs still require their own explicit later grant and review.


## S2 mapping corrected; remaining observability limits preserved (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT read the complete I23 remaining-map audit and RV29 vk_s2_mapping_40 review,
verified every payload, and accepts source readiness of the correction to
existing rf_finite. The review's “S2 cause and original criterion” proves the
zero-reference sign invariance and separate spring-action branch; its cited
unchanged finite-family references establish eligibility, not a predicted kill.
The error was our later frozen narrowing of the original reaction/VALUE register.
P35 remains an unqualified survivor. The failed-to-dispatch P36 preparation is
preserved as a manager timing overrun, not a test result or host-tool defect.

The fresh BRIEFS/A1_VK_S2_RETARGET.md window includes the actual P36 control and
controlled corrected witness. No protected criterion is weakened. Remaining
F05/F06/F07/R28 mappings have their existing specific observables; R02's schema
does not expose the numerical estimate/charge values. Only an attributable
existing named R7/acceptance change could qualify that current observation;
work-only or certificate-only drift cannot. A missing witness remains a stop,
not permission for new instrumentation or a waiver. All final A1 gates remain.


## S2 corrected VALUE witness qualified; remaining A1 validation (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT read the full RV29 vk_s2_result_41/REVIEW.md, verified all payloads and
seal97cb6c7a3542616af3e9a86ca8e43d5e4c85e94608ae1c71fccabd5436c7bd6f,
and accepts the corrected S2 observation under the unchanged nonzero-reaction
VALUE criterion. The review's Actual numerical witness and Controls and history
sections state the exact case/key/reference attribution and actual returned
controls. P35 remains permanently zero-credit; its actual P36 return is closed.
The expired earlier preparation remains history, not an execution or authority.

Close the S2 runtime window. Release original P37-P47 only under the fresh
BRIEFS/A1_VK_REMAINDER_09.md grant. R02's unprinted numerical-field gap remains;
existing scalar and TREE100 tests are bounded investigation inputs, not P49
credit or an amended criterion. P48-P53 remain held pending ROOT's next grant.
No source, oracle, protected criterion or F17 scope changes. A1 acceptance,
final-head gates, merge and F2a reliance remain open.

The sealed caller14 and kernel_reference22 K6c instantiations have been preserved
for independent reviews RV28 reference_callers_10 and RV30 kernel_reference_27.
These are conditional source-arithmetic candidates; composition, result ordering,
context/code translation, artifact qualification, admission and measurements
remain. They do not block A1's independent completion path.


## Conditional generic K6c components verified (ROOT, 2026-10-01)

ROOT read the complete RV30 kernel_reference_27/RETURN.md and RV28
reference_callers_10/REVIEW.md and verified all payloads under seals
2e0e0cf05cea3c11ea2a7b6eb4d26b0b5afb3886b0a1eae1e71bc816ecef6c82 and
c3eadadd67f038cbb4e56a10cf9cf89a168bea8e2ae4a554646f484a5cf930b7.
Accept their independently verified generic kernel and caller instantiations
conditionally on the explicitly named source, input, request-profile and launch
premises. The reports give full roster/metric figures and their scoped units;
no measured heap supplied an arithmetic term.

Reference B/b substitutions are tagged monotone population uppers, not graph
facts. Original stored z/h and actual generic spring/load/string terms remain.
Mathematical SingleCaseFamilyReferenceV1 and actual CLI24 retain their distinct
input/launch/count policies; equal case names do not identify those contexts.
No field is zeroed or forced solely to satisfy ordering. The complete result
join, context/allocation translation, checked maintained implementation, final
ordinary-production correspondence, admission and measurements remain open.
These component dispositions do not accept full E_max or delay A1's own gates.


## Remaining precision/mechanism witnesses qualified (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read the complete RV29 vk_remaining_43/REVIEW.md, verified every payload
under sealcb1d7ce04d69db302d5d5c6b1dc26735b22d3bbb619a876f80c558e0fb2c6248,
and accepts the scoped UNKNOWN/F05/F06/F07 semantic witnesses and their actual
planned normal controls. The report's Scoped semantic results and Controls and
full scope sections preserve the exact verdicts, roles, bodies and parity scope.
Generic failure, record/work drift and the F17 alternative supply no credit.

Preserve the manager's disclosed late closeout as a timing exception: the review's
Source, artifact and raw provenance section establishes actual execution inside
the grant and distinguishes the manager's later seal. ROOT does not retroactively
extend the window or call the entire closeout compliant. Its child-seal timing
was reported by ROOT, not independently reconstructed from a manifest-write stamp.
The numerical/source/artifact evidence remains independently assessable and was
verified. The next runtime block reserved explicit sealing time and has returned;
R28/R02/scalar results remain pending independent review44. Final A1 gates remain.


## Conditional K6c result composition verified (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read the complete RV30 result5_join_28/RETURN.md and verified every payload
under seald0f850310a9519441d274b7a270bdb834162811d5bc048b880edee70da354eac.
Accept the matching conditional reference/CLI composition and five-field ordering
within its exact inherited input, profile, launch and metric premises. The report
states all numerical maxima and comparison windows; they are expression bounds,
not measurements or admission decisions. No actual graph count, unspecified
future path allowance or current-executable qualification is inferred.

The accepted kernel/caller/join review packets live on the separate K6c branch,
currently commit60a52da9467b73d25898e01312e20d7a4c533902; their immutable manifests
are the warrants even where another checkout does not carry the relative paths.
ROOT merged reviewed A1 source/accounting942572 into K6c at8b6b4db5aa5ee8a3a3db149ff36b9418910bc9a3
and verified exact maintained core/validation equality before releasing the
bounded shared-kernel implementation. Original reference storage facts remain
pinned to their prior origins, not rebound to refreshed A1 observations.

Context16 is an unaccepted implementation proposal with named H caller binding
and origin/failure questions; their bounded reviews are in progress. Shared-kernel
translation does not release a partial legacy estimate or adapter. Complete
context translation, checked implementation, final artifact/source/request/input/
launch correspondence, admission replay and required measurements remain open.


## Final registered R28/R02 witnesses qualified (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read the complete fresh RV31 vk_final_01/RETURN.md and verified all payloads
under seal831cdff691167473c40c17f95d27b7a23e4a40e516aa51b85511e15a3ac1d0f0.
Accept the original R28 and original VR TREE100 R02 semantic witnesses with their
actual normal controls. The report's Actual results section gives the exact
reached shift and named VerificationEstimate/acceptance transitions. No missing
ratio, work counter, generic refusal or certificate substitute supplies credit.

The separate original scalar test supplies complementary seed-site evidence only;
its later assertions remain unexecuted and uncredited in the fault call. No FK
TREE100 substitution is used. Other unshown Ceilings receive no invented cause or
separate credit. All original parity records restore, including their original
Sensitive statuses; restoration does not mean every comparison is Passed.

The interrupted RV29 final44 archive-only partial has a ROOT preservation note
and seal, not a completed reviewer verdict. RV31 is a fresh independent native
identity; its review binds cf7841 and does not silently approve later HEADs.
The complete V-K packets and their approved replacement/disposition history are
ready for final-candidate reconciliation. Prior unqualified attempts, the unrun
superseded P15, and the narrowly owner-approved F17 alternative remain distinct.
No protected criterion is weakened and no numerical source/test/oracle changed.

Freeze the final A1 candidate after integration, then require independent exact-
candidate confirmation, full-SHA hosted dispatch/CI, clean exact-head GEN-8 and
Mac DEC-025 comparison before merge. The source-reach check remains H/validation
only unless the final diff establishes otherwise. AUD-T3-01 and F2a reliance stay
held until actual closure; K6c implementation/qualification is a separate path.


## K6c shared implementation and caller contract (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read the complete RV33 kernel_01 RETURN/REVIEW and verified its25 payloads
under sealf50f48bfdaa4874a556b7660285ed0328bba57ee0f7bf099892ad2bdf4e7d919
(run from packet root; manifest is under _run_records). Accept bounded kernel
fan-in for exact4a6cb3402f95d98c6f46f702055fe4b0c5245c56 under its declared
reference premises. The review's Independent compiled checks reports the actual
clean-archive tests and full reference comparisons. This does not cover later
H helper/adapter edits, current-artifact qualification or a complete admission
estimate. Those changes need their own exact-candidate review/backcheck.

ROOT also read and verified RV32 h_context_01 (seal8ca1f20ce41d85c513b2443990780983f8463a3dc24e91e80bcc3fe7a938e89f)
and selects its reviewed H1/H2/H3 caller contract, as concretely recorded in the
review and ROOT_CLARIFICATION. Explicit OriginalK6bPair is reference-only; actual
normal and counts-continuation contexts carry their actual known arguments.
Runner pre-admission must be rebound before using a numeric estimate or ratio
denominator. The source-refused variant retains raw-input construction bounds,
normal staged refusal and positive source-window totals; explicit zero components
mean unexecuted kernel phases only. Actual repeat digits enter outer-prefix
formatting. No flags, policy thresholds, stale fallback or unbounded future-path
allowance is introduced.

The implementation and review packets were relocated intact into their existing
_run_records evidence roles; old-location pointers and the complete blob/mode
ledger preserve custody. No source/evidence/checker bytes were changed by that
placement correction. I21 H and I24 VR implementation grants own disjoint caller
fences, with the narrowly notified raw-H helper extraction separately requiring
RV33 backcheck. Complete adapters, protected tests/mutants, final ordinary-source/
request/type/input/launch qualification, admission replay and measurements remain.


## A1 merged; AUD-T3-01 publication correction closed (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

A1 merged as PR1070 at3a0251874d6ab38008173a22ef09d651a0f20d9e from the exact
reviewed/gated headcb13dcd9fcc8c252fa9610b1c6fef0c5b2c3c20c. ROOT fetched and
verified unchanged main546e05a159a58f5ceffe1d315373bc2f31982ea8 immediately before
--merge --match-head-commit. The merge's parents match both bindings.
IMPLEMENTATION/A1_MERGE/RECORD.md carries the same-pass merge record and links
RV31's source/records and external-gate confirmations plus preserved gate evidence.

Close AUD-T3-01 for the reviewed retained publication route under the independently
derived, owner-selected M03-INTEGRITY-MP-v2 replacement. This does not vindicate the
old A1 proof assumption or edit the audit/counterexample history. The audit-specific
hold on relying on that corrected published guarantee is discharged on this basis.
F2a still waits for K6c/ROOT W1 limits and its own contract adoption/qualification;
no product receipt, native route or engineering release is implied.

K6c H and VR integration candidates have returned with author tests. ROOT full-
diff verification, independent actual-candidate review/helper backcheck, complete
mutation obligations, final ordinary-artifact/input/launch qualification,
chronological admission and required measurements remain before its acceptance.
All other T3 successors and owner decisions stay as recorded in the work graph.


## K6c runner holds precede automatic counts binding (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

The independent RV32 VR and RV33 H reviews of exact
9086964a1fb656a76cda6d1002d8594efa636fdc identified a blocking ordering defect:
new model-specific counts binding can occur before the existing conditional
approval or recorded-ascent hold is evaluated. ROOT read RV33's process-free
RUNNER_HOLD_REPRO.json and confirmed the source ordering. No actual 10,000-member
process was run by these reproductions. Final review returns remain pending.

Keep those holds before automatic model-specific counts/normal launches in
run_tier. Existing tier noop baselines and explicit standalone counts acquisition
retain their semantics. After nonnumeric eligibility passes, bind the actual
launch context before numeric admission/backstop and ratio use; no stale or fake
counts substitute is permitted. Existing named refusal, conditional approval,
recorded-ascent semantics, thresholds, normal caps, VR counts cap and process-free
plan behavior remain. This is a correction within the accepted caller contract,
not a new policy or owner-held limit.

ROOT grants I24 a 20-minute four-file H/VR runner-and-test repair, with additive
I24/runner_hold_repair_02 evidence and no other maintained edits. Same RV32/RV33
reviewers must backcheck the committed repair. They continue exact-908 review
against their own archives while I24 edits. I21 separately receives a 45-minute
archive-only kernel/H mutation assignment against908, with actual patches and
NONE control under I21/kernel_mutants_26. No performance slot or final-bound
acceptance follows from either assignment. Native tasks retain no Git/index
write authority; ROOT integrates. A1 remains merged and its audit closure stands.


## Owner pause after K6c runner closure and mutation stop (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

The owner requested a graceful halt at the current convenient conclusion.
All current bounded TASKs returned and stopped; no follow-on implementation,
experiment or performance slot was granted. T3 is paused by owner direction,
not complete. HANDOFF_2026-10-02_OWNER_PAUSE.md is the recovery entrypoint.

ROOT read both complete same-reviewer backchecks and verified their payloads.
Close RV33-H1 and RV32-V1 on10315a8167c47f43aa41402beb88ed2c70e62cf2:
R/source_review_RV33/runner_backcheck_03 and
R/design_review_RV32/_run_records/runner_backcheck_03. The latter was relocated
intact into its raw evidence role; the navigation pointer and custody ledger
preserve every sealed byte/mode. No numeric admission policy was weakened.
Author system-Python use is disclosed; independent backchecks used the requested
VENV. This closes the runner defects only, not complete K6c qualification.

Preserve I21/kernel_mutants_26 as an incomplete required programme: its RETURN
reports NONE passing, four numerical assertion kills and the real M05 Uc-overlap
survivor. The archive is restored but its last compiled mutant binary remains
diagnostic. Seven later kernel variants are unrun. No mutant survivor is waived.
I24/vr_mutants_prep_03 is uncompiled/unexecuted preparation with two pending
witness cells; I25/historical_replay_01 is a conditional author replay awaiting
independent review and historical VR launch-gap disposition. Neither is accepted
as complete E_max or a measurement/admission grant.

The source/review/evidence checkpoint is K6C4be7239b9f356beee5c7e4ab2f689033fad30245;
maintained source remains10315. ROOT verified the returned seals and preserved
the requested interpreter note and all raw evidence. No target/baseline was
pruned. A1 remains merged at3a0251874d6ab38008173a22ef09d651a0f20d9e, with the
corrected retained-route AUD-T3-01 closure and broader F2a prerequisites distinct.

ROOT also reconciled the graph's stale Current table cell with A1's already
recorded merge and this pause; historical progression remains preserved. Resume
only after owner direction, starting with the narrow M05 witness/test gap and
then the existing K6c sequence. Standing TASK/Git/gate rules and all owner-held
T3 choices remain in force.


## Owner resumes after graceful halt (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

The owner explicitly resumed T3 and asked ROOT to retain and improve its management
lessons. The preceding pause is historical and revoked by that direction. No A1
gate is reopened: GitHub confirms PR1070 merged and main remains3a0251874.
K6C40179f1da5961cfef7edeaf7be4eb675379f79b5 is clean and pushed; its maintained
source is10315. The M5guard is running and no Cargo/rustc/solver process was left.

Previous native child sessions are absent, so fresh I26 and RV34 identities are
dispatched directly by ROOT. I26 owns only a narrow source-valid Uc regression
witness/test and exact NONE/M05 check; RV34 independently reviews I25's saved
historical replay. Their scopes are disjoint; no large measurement slot or wider
implementation/host-tool grant follows. Briefs are R/BRIEFS/I26_UC_WITNESS_01.md
and RV34_HISTORICAL_REPLAY_01.md.

Operational lessons for this run: name the claim and a decisive falsification
check before delegation; expose individual lifetime terms that outer maxima can
mask; keep implementation, review, artifact qualification, admission and measured
acceptance distinct; give shared edits one owner and frozen review bases; report
supporting work against the numerical question and its time bound; retain one
compact recovery entrypoint with selected evidence. These are this run's execution
practice, not an amendment to standing agent instructions or a reusable workflow.


## Narrow VR lifetime-phase regression grant (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

The saved VR preparation names two unexecuted witness gaps. ROOT commissions
fresh I27 to distinguish phase-identity coverage from domination by later global
maxima, and to add only source-backed local phase regressions. A narrowly
mechanical private helper extraction in VR/src/envelope.rs is permitted if the
existing estimator consumes it and algebra/lifetimes remain unchanged. No public
contract, bound policy, supported input domain or protected criterion changes.
The detailed fence and25-minute bound are R/BRIEFS/I27_VR_PHASE_WITNESSES_01.md.
I26 retains the Cargo lane until explicit ROOT release. H/VR writes are disjoint.
Independent review follows ROOT verification/commit before any claimed closure.


## Historical replay verified at its declared scope (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read the complete RV34 historical_replay_01 return and verified its31
payloads under sealec4c1328d05fc66eb16225040f3f9b2ef52df0b0186dde49e9353592633a1dba.
Accept the independently recomposed conditional source/records replay in I25's
packet. RV34's result table establishes all102 old dictionaries reproduced,
all66 H decisions still admitted with actual historical H path deltas, and six
largest-size backstop deferrals in each VR history under its reference profile.
Its Chronology, H launch/metric and Floating-point sections establish the checked
denominators, windows and boundary semantics. None is a new run authorization.

Preserve the exact historical VR argv0/model-path/compiled-manifest and artifact
transfer limitation. The large sparse subtotal independently establishes the
largest-size deferrals under that bound policy; lower-size admission and VR peak
comparisons remain reference-launch conditional. No measured excess or universal
historic executable bound is inferred. Further broad missing-path archaeology is
not commissioned. Final prospective ordinary-artifact/input/launch qualification
and measurements remain mandatory before full K6c acceptance.

I26's source-valid Uc witness is committed2ae028eb275684ac0aa8082e034128ff251027a4.
I27's algebra-preserving private VR phase helpers/tests are committed in the
combined81c03849033f3ce745668f581f446530789397b8. ROOT read their full maintained
diffs and sealed returns and verified write sets/postimages. Both authored mutant
results await fresh RV35 review; M05 history and I24's unexecuted preparation are
not rewritten. No wider mutant programme or scale slot is released yet.


## Lifetime witness gaps closed; remaining mutants released (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read the complete fresh RV35 phase_witnesses_01 return and verified its58
payloads under seal29b74e5e480de5e3485df2111d411fb2449d94eb0d39350cda5aafd54cadb4b9.
Accept both maintained changes on81c03849033f3ce745668f581f446530789397b8 within
that exact conditional source-arithmetic scope. Close the Uc overlap witness gap
and VR-SPARSE-16F-WITNESS / VR-REFUSED-FORMAT-ARGUMENT-WITNESS. The independent
source/owner checks and execution table establish the intended local identities,
actual normal controls and exact mutant discrimination. No source expression,
public contract, numerical bound policy or supported input domain was weakened.

H/Uc M05's original survivor remains history. VR-M02's global masking and the
separate VR-M05 existing-phase detection remain explicit; neither is called a
measured global undercount. These closures do not complete the wider mutation
programme or qualify an executable/measurement.

ROOT now dispatches I26 directly for the prepared30-minute remaining-kernel
mutation brief, R/BRIEFS/I26_KERNEL_REMAINDER_02.md, on the same maintained81c038
basis. The Cargo lane is free and reserved to that TASK; no other runtime grant
is implied. Stop on the first survivor/normal failure or compile-only failure.
No production/test repair is included in that archive-only assignment.


## Remaining VR mutation execution grant (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

I26 reports completed M06–M12 executions without a survivor or compile-only
failure and has released the Cargo lane; its full sealed return still awaits
ROOT verification and independent review. ROOT confirms no cargo/rustc process.
Dispatch I27 for the prepared25-minute remaining VR estimate mutation block,
R/BRIEFS/I27_VR_MUTANTS_REMAINDER_02.md, on maintained81c038. Only archive/evidence
writes are authorized; stop rules and no criterion/source weakening remain.
This grant is execution of required validation, not acceptance of I26's unreviewed
return or any artifact/measurement qualification. No scale or V-K matrix slot
is implied.


## Estimate mutation programme closed; ordinary artifact freeze (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read the complete RV35 mutant_programme_02 return and verified its65 payloads
under seal28cdda3eae3bb9f0bb14ed5f8d1f284afbbe05c306c48d652a3688f798bf29d4.
Accept the complete estimate-mutation obligation at maintained81c03849033f3ce745668f581f446530789397b8:
its disposition table accounts for12 kernel and6 VR variants with actual compiled
intended failures, valid normal controls, source carry and separate historical
outcomes. This is conditional identity/named-phase coverage, not a measured heap
claim or complete E_max/current-artifact acceptance. The V-K seeded matrix is
a separate outstanding obligation.

ROOT also read I28's complete preflight plan/commands/source-binding table and
verified its17 payloads under seal3dec8828da450103fba7ede7ab46826d186a901fd00fec9290aa27a87e8483f3.
Select maintained81c038 as the production source freeze for the next bounded
ordinary artifact preparation/correspondence block. Required V-K/final gates
remain; later maintained changes reopen affected bindings.

Dispatch I28 under R/BRIEFS/I28_ORDINARY_ARTIFACTS_02.md for45 minutes on the existing
M5 guard/sole Cargo lane. Only ordinary H/VR builds, finite existing native request
inspection and one unchanged accepted ten-type reporter are authorized. No new
tool/reader/guard/probe, arbitrary private-layout inference, counts/model/solver
or measurement run. Missing attribution remains a named unqualified cell. ROOT
will independently review returned evidence before relying on a bound.


## V-K first adapter block released (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read I27 vk_execution_plan_03 RETURN/PLAN and the exact B1/first-route
command and criterion metadata; its seal41fe834ae3ef144754a9396a002aca17bd8defbc772002963c0a1ad5c107035c
verifies. The unchanged original seeded sites, criterion-bearing sources and
empty overlay list support this current-candidate execution selection.

Release only block A_FIRST: fresh debug seeded adapter build on maintained81c038,
then separate NONE/F10/NONE and NONE/UNKNOWN/NONE processes using the exact
canonical-permutation filter. Twelve-minute total from native receipt, cutoff9.
Expected F10 is the original canonical-array comparison; UNKNOWN must reach the
named unknown-fault panic. Compilation, zero-test or unrelated failure is not a
witness. Normal controls must execute and pass the complete original test.
No retained solve,10000 construction, other group, overlay or source/criterion
change is granted. I28 completed all compiler/reporter work and continues only
native evidence inspection; the sole Cargo lane transfers to I27. Later B/C/D
blocks and independent acceptance remain separate.


## V-K debug semantic block B released (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read I27 vk_runtime_04 RETURN, verified81 payloads under seal91c7602386af0ee890296cc8634762b864f81f66b027e1602c0a4ba85e4e4132,
and preserved its actual first-block controls. The UNKNOWN quoting discrepancy
was an evidence-matcher transcription error: ROOT independently checked the
unchanged seeded.rs Debug-format panic and historical P37 raw message. The fault
was not rerun and no criterion changed; the original restoring NONE completed.
Independent full V-K result review is still outstanding.

Release I27 B2/B_DEBUG under R/BRIEFS/I27_VK_DEBUG_05.md for30 minutes, preserving
all eight exact routes and fresh controls. ROOT has read the plan's original
filters/criteria and historical timing fields; these are no fresh duration promise.
Only original small-case retained solves/parity in those tests are permitted.
No release records group, mechanical full matrix, scale job or measurement follows
automatically. Ordinary-artifact review RV36 runs read-only on a disjoint fence.


## Ordinary artifact correspondence accepted; V-K release block C (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read the full RV36 RETURN and additive TIME_CORRECTION, verified final95
payloads under sealccfce99f7a5099bc6910fea41f3fa9b4e56b9763f95882d7c2bd4a65ed293fb2
and the unchanged original92-payload seal42b7d36683f1157e8ba56473fe2f90142cb855b3ccd2d34924e22dae8b01f1e8.
Accept I28's ordinary H/VR source/build/type/request correspondence within those
stated premises. Direct current-image requests, carried nominal facts, four
source-composed internal pairs, unavailable complete link map and inferred omitted
defaults remain distinguished. The ten-type current reporter is independently
confirmed. The timestamp correction withdraws unsampled precision; it changes no
technical result. No complete run, input/launch, admission or measurement grant
is implied. Those separate bindings remain required.

ROOT also read I27 B_DEBUG RETURN and verified206 payloads under
seal01ae9fd2f71ff16a96ea35979b98978b93a7cf0821cb3e19847336f8bd8c9909.
All assigned author routes have actual restoring controls and qualified named
witnesses; full independent V-K programme review remains outstanding. Preserve
zero-credit extras and unexecuted later assertions.

Release only B3/C_RELEASE under R/BRIEFS/I27_VK_RELEASE_06.md for30 minutes.
The full existing family/show/parity scope, original criteria and separately
owner-approved F17 cases remain unchanged. Historical seconds are not a current
duration guarantee. No full mechanical matrix, scale run or maintained edit
is included. The Cargo lane is idle and assigned only to that TASK.


## Row139 input acquisition released; later comparison held (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read RV36 measurement_plan_02 and verified its13-payload seal9c71189cd1d3f4c341a128bc69e016bf1d03a0d3ac10e7843ff14a943769bb04.
Accept first-step readiness only. The complete37 parsed seed fields and additional
invariants are mandatory before any row-specific seed reliance; other models and
automatic tiers remain unqualified. No15-field summary or runner positive-estimate
check substitutes for full correspondence.

Release I26 under R/BRIEFS/I26_INPUT_QUALIFICATION_04.md for20 minutes: existing
quiet/guard check, exactly the same ordinary H no-op and exact row139 counts-only
prepass, then stop before admission/solve. This is evidence acquisition on the
reviewed artifact, not timing/calibration or a scale grant. No matrix compiler/run
shares this quiet acquisition slot; other active work is read-only review.
The historical full-publication comparison stays held; the owner has a concrete
scoped proposal and has not yet answered. No dependent acceptance is assumed.


## Current V-K semantic review and D mechanical grant (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read the complete RV37 vk_semantics_01 RETURN and verified718 payloads
under seal4d195d574d100a98ebc06f10b97154480f28cbdf8aa80c81bdef48236354cc65.
Accept its current fifteen-ID plus UNKNOWN semantic coverage within its stated
source, feature, profile, controls and observed/unreached-result limits. D's
mechanical matrix remains outstanding and supplies no substitute semantic credit.

[Correction to I27/vk_runtime_05 RETURN's RF-WEAK summary: RV37 independently
verified thirteen quantity-level CLASS mismatch lines across ten distinct
protected case/row comparisons. Three bending-magnitude comparisons each yield
Ry and Rz lines. The original51-comparison roster and three InputDerived
exceptions remain unchanged. This corrects summary wording only; preserve the
original sealed evidence.] Same-reviewer wording confirmation follows.

I26 input_qualification_04 has completed its two authorized processes and
released the quiet slot. ROOT read RETURN and COMMAND_SCOPE_ADDENDUM, verified
the20-payload base and separate addendum seals, and committed both. The return
reports full row139 seed/context correspondence; independent RV36 backcheck is
commissioned before final disposition. No ordinary solve, admission, rho or
measurement result is claimed. Other models remain unqualified.

Release only I27 D under R/BRIEFS/I27_VK_MECHANICAL_07.md for45 minutes. The
archive must include the original feature guard's complete manifest-discovery
scope and release checker. The unchanged full runner, normal control, all
registered IDs and UNKNOWN are required; any timeout or bad result stops the
owned process group. No new tool, source change or scale run is granted.
The owner historical-publication comparison question remains pending.


## Row139 qualified; semantic wording confirmed (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read RV36 input_qualification_03 in full and verified its12 payloads
under sealcf88a684bf31e1b48484f87d320a26006462dc9beeeb282a339bb06941e1276f.
Accept I26's finite row139 input/count/context correspondence only. RV36's
Independent result table establishes the complete consumed-field/invariant and
actual-context checks; its Actual execution scope distinguishes the successful
short process from an RSS-watchdog intervention witness. No normal solve,
admission, rho, performance or full E_max acceptance follows. Other seeds and
all staged measurements remain outstanding.

ROOT also read RV37 vk_semantics_02 and verified its4 payloads under
seal9cda91957521bb68f8aee48401a48084cbaa144e9c512fa07171c7c46adc554c.
The same reviewer confirms the additive RF-WEAK correction resolves RV37-N1.
Original sealed author evidence remains intact; no numerical rerun is needed.

I26's later read-only preparation identifies fourteen remaining first-pass
small-tier model acquisitions under the existing sealed launch manifest. It
also identifies inherited H run_tier limits: full catalogue schedule enumeration
occurs before tier filtering, the tier baseline is not rejected on classification,
and the binding helper itself checks a positive estimate rather than complete
seed correspondence. ROOT read these source paths and their base diff. Fresh
RV38 confirms the catalogue/no-op behavior is inherited; the repaired eligibility
contract concerns model-specific subprocesses. Complete seed correspondence
remains an external qualification prerequisite, not a commissioned new tool.
No automatic T1 grant or runner repair follows from this preparation. A later
grant must explicitly account catalogue preparation, successful same-artifact
baseline, full small-seed qualification and truthful stop/measurement boundaries.
I27's independent mechanical work and RV38's composite source review continue.


## Fresh composite K6c source review accepted at source scope (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read the full RV38 composite_source_01 RETURN and COVERAGE and verified
its10 payloads under seal924bacd98904d647db9080716bf2e32fec9b3e5c9d578bf8c384d28bee46dfab.
Accept source-review fan-in for the complete28-file maintained diff from
main3a0251874d6ab38008173a22ef09d651a0f20d9e to81c03849033f3ce745668f581f446530789397b8,
under the accepted conditional profiles and explicit ordinary/input qualifiers.
Its Source assessment and Independent metadata/arithmetic checks establish the
reviewed coverage. No actionable maintained-source finding remains in that
review. It does not establish final measurements, complete K6c/E_max, final
revision gates, F2a or engineering acceptance.

In particular H's source/solve/prefix windows retain their own matching metrics.
Do not compare parsing, count-acquisition, later serialization or global summary
peaks to H's stage bound as though it were an all-process heap theorem. The
independently reviewed inherited catalogue/no-op behavior and external full-seed
qualification requirements stand. No runner redesign is commissioned.

Process exception disclosure: RV38's Remaining scope records one initial Git
status without optional-lock suppression; subsequent reads suppressed it. ROOT
does not claim that initial command enforced zero optional index refresh. No
explicit index operation or maintained delta is reported, and all maintained
postimages match the frozen candidate. Preserve that distinction alongside the
actual native parentage/write-fence record; do not rewrite it into a blanket
no-Git-writes history.


## Small-tier inputs qualified; first measurements bounded (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read I26 t1_inputs_05 RETURN and verified all93 payloads under
seal86a3c7c98c17e68d7d65f3c3a674779674735fc6ab198440eebb321e8a801c4c.
ROOT also independently parsed every raw acquisition with duplicate-key rejection,
checked all37 consumed fields and20 invariants against each model's own immutable
seed, fresh estimate fields, actual planned argv/start metadata, zero repeats,
no dump and empty normal records. The preserved ROOT_T1_INPUT_CHECK_20261002.json
reports these new checks. Together with independently reviewed row139, accept
finite input correspondence for all fifteen T1 models and their bound contexts.
No normal solve or measurement was performed by those acquisitions.

Prepare original W1-T1 under R/BRIEFS/I26_T1_MEASUREMENTS_06.md. ROOT's separate
explicit lane-release message starts its30-minute grant. This knowingly includes
the unchanged runner's complete Python catalogue metadata enumeration; no larger
product solve/count or tier is granted by that bookkeeping. Actual baseline
success is externally checked before relying on its measurements; invalid
baseline means stop and no accepted results, including any provisional process
started before detection. Complete seed qualification precedes tier reliance,
and every new normal/binding record is checked again. No runner patch, host
tool, policy/tolerance change or protected-comparison waiver is commissioned.

I27's mechanical matrix has returned, ROOT read its full RETURN and verified
all80 payloads under seale032d1a49db4f92458b12e18c9644cf388f891c9007e152d92211f720a4ed8dc.
Its runtime is stopped/reaped. RV37 independently reviews it; no full mechanical
acceptance is inferred until that review returns. Composite source review stands.
The owner KF3 historical-publication comparison question remains pending.


## Full V-K mechanical matrix closed (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read the complete RV37 vk_mechanical_03 RETURN and verified its12 payloads
under seal1d98a8a25ac596458b84e998a46cb512194243c6184df723e7e8f1f7f93d78ed.
Accept D's complete original mechanical matrix at maintained81c038. The report's
row table and full-log analysis establish the normal suite, registered failures,
UNKNOWN panic, completed exits and absence of timeouts; its source/artifact and
process paragraphs bind full scope and reap. No unresolved actionable finding
remains. The suppressed initial-build stream remains a disclosed inference from
unchanged runner control flow and later actual artifacts, not an invented event.

D adds no semantic credit; independently accepted A/B/C witnesses and their
normal restoration carry that separate obligation. Both V-K semantic and full
mechanical checks are now accounted for this K6c source candidate. This closes
neither ordinary measurements nor final K6c/gates or engineering acceptance.

The first ordinary W1-T1 grant is active with I26, receipt05:36:25 UTC, runtime
cutoff06:01:25 and return06:06:25. It has the sole quiet/timed slot under the
existing guard. No later tier grant or owner comparison amendment is implied.


## T1 observations accepted; missed live inspections disposition (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read RV34 t1_measurements_02 in full and verified its19 payloads under
sealb75ff372045ddcc057637ae006c4a54f279aeb683a52ec75a34015301cbf65b5.
Accept its independently reconstructed finite post-run T1 observations. Its
actual-scope table, Baseline and chronological arithmetic, Complete input/context
and window checks, and Outcome/work sections establish the qualifying data.
These successful, source/artifact/input-bound rows may supply the existing
recorded-ascent and eligible smaller-row calibration predicates, with the unchanged
minimum-size rule. They establish no larger-size or whole-process heap guarantee.

RV34-T1-F1 is a real P2 execution deviation: the required immediate/live external
checks did not occur. ROOT owns the assignment and accepts this completed small
tier's observations after complete independent retrospective validation, while
retaining the unfulfilled process requirement. No fully compliant live-gated run
is claimed, and no missing live evidence is backfilled. All baseline, binding,
window and stop-trigger predicates tested on the complete retained records pass;
there is no observed invalid baseline, mismatched input, bound breach or other
trigger concealed by this disposition. A retry solely to manufacture a different
supervision history is not commissioned. This is a disposition of this finite
assignment, not a standing-loop or numerical-criterion amendment. Same-reviewer
confirmation of the scoped disposition is required before releasing T2.

Cleanup credit is limited to the source-supported wrapper waits, recorded outer
exit/reap and actual endpoint command snapshots. Success-path survivors=[] is a
default, not an executed group scan; the historical arrays remain untouched.
Filesystem log times remain filesystem provenance, not sampled process endpoints.

ROOT preserved all412 T1 raw files byte-exact in the immutable
R/MEASUREMENTS/W1_T1/_run_records/records.tar.gz before any later chronological
journal append. RV34 independently verified every manifest member. The live
working journal may grow only under a later explicit grant, preserving its old
prefix and the immutable snapshot; sealed author/review bytes remain unchanged.

The prepared T2 brief explicitly keeps successful baselines, complete input gates,
all numeric limits and full post-run checks. Existing tools should observe
progress while possible; a missed external observation must be disclosed and
results remain provisional until validated. No new guard/runner or source change
is authorized. The owner-held KF3 T4 comparison and all later gates remain held.


## T1 disposition confirmed; T2 released (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read RV34 t1_disposition_03 and verified its3-payload seal
b3b562a58f2f69203256443a61ed4eb122f97c97b0d07976f98d529881623391.
The same independent reviewer confirms RV34-T1-F1 has a truthful sufficient ROOT
disposition for finite T1 observations, with no unsupported inference. Close its
disposition requirement; the historical live-inspection failure remains recorded.
The unchanged minimum-size rule still prevents these sub100-member observations
from calibrating a target at least1000; they can support their eligible next tier.

Release only the prepared I26_T2_MEASUREMENTS_07.md scope. ROOT's explicit native
message starts its30-minute bound/cutoff25 and sole quiet/timed slot. Six named
100-member input acquisitions must satisfy the complete map before the original
W1-T2 tier begins; the shared journal preserves its old prefix and immutable T1
snapshot. All numeric holds, successful baseline and complete measurement checks
remain. No T3/T4, new tooling, source change or owner comparison amendment follows.


## T2 accepted with corrected numerical classes; T3 released (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read the full RV34 t2_measurements_04 RETURN and verified its19-payload
seal470ccf012178bc14fa02340203632bf3e6faaca6594d880146f487536fc6d32a.
Accept the independently verified finite T2 observations and complete pre-tier
input qualification, with the review's actual-scope/chronology/window limits.
No unresolved actionable finding remains. The source and ordinary artifact are
unchanged. The T1 journal prefix and immutable T2 delta are verified preserved.

The author base RETURN's sparse All12 Passed cell is incorrect; its separately
sealed OUTCOME_CORRECTION is mandatory with that return. RV34 independently
confirms CHAIN/TREE contribute8 Sensitive sparse processes and CONT4 Passed;
all12 W1 processes select128 with verification256. These are process counts over
two passes per model, not12 distinct models. Process classificationok is not a
claim of Passed numerical status. No raw outcome or numerical criterion changed.

Actual baseline inspection occurred while the tier was active, after two normal
rows. Per-row checks were post-run, as disclosed and allowed by this T2 grant;
no earlier or full live-gate claim follows. Cleanup and filesystem-time credit
remain narrow as reviewed. The successful100-member observations can supply
existing eligible calibration/ascent predicates for larger targets, including
Sensitive sparse observations under the unchanged process-classification rule.
That does not reclassify numerical quality or predict any future admission.

Release only I26_T3_MEASUREMENTS_08.md. ROOT's separate explicit native message
starts its45-minute grant with40-minute runtime stop/reap cutoff. Six named1000-
member input gates precede original W1-T3, with actual100-member calibration,
unchanged numeric holds, complete field/window checks and exact prefix evidence.
No T4/10000-member product construction, new tooling, source change or owner
comparison amendment is granted. All final K6c/merge gates remain outstanding.


## T3 measurements accepted; T4 held for owner comparison decision (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read the complete RV34 t3_measurements_05 RETURN and verified its24 payloads
under seal57d677defe4728c36be3bba2bdb3d0b5ecf0ae4366affe4dbf48003358d8b507.
Accept the finite ordinary1000-member observations, input/context qualification,
calibrated admissions and exact required prefix evidence within their reviewed
profile/window scope. The review's actual-scope, Admission/calibration, Actual
caller/H windows and Prefix-completeness sections establish the result. No
unresolved actionable finding remains. No matched H heap field breached its
corresponding bound; unclaimed global/pre-reset windows stay explicit.

All six cases have their required executed prefix ends, not an assumed requested
count. The numerical classes remain12 W1 Selected128/verification256 and sparse
8 Sensitive/4 Passed across the two passes. Current100/1000-member observations
supply eligible earlier data under the existing policy; no T4 admission has been
evaluated or granted. The immutable T3 delta preserves the complete prior journal
prefix and all original raw hashes. Snapshot cleanup evidence keeps the review's
actual-scan limits and does not turn default survivor arrays into scans.

All currently commissioned implementation, execution and review blocks have
returned. No automatic follow-on is assigned; the existing M5 guard remains.
T3 is active at an owner-decision hold, not complete or newly owner-paused.
The outstanding decision is R/OWNER_CHECKPOINTS/K6C_PUBLISHED_ROWS_01.md. The
owner has not approved that scoped amendment. Original complete historical
published-value equality remains unestablished and its protected obligation
remains held. No10000-member input acquisition or T4 runtime is released.

After that decision: separately bind/qualify the six T4 inputs and actual launch
contexts, review the fresh baseline/admission data, and grant the unchanged
schedule only under its existing numeric policy; never override a numeric
deferral. Then complete the K6c return, final independent exact-candidate review,
full-SHA hosted CI, exact-final-head Mac DEC-025 and GEN-8 before any PR merge.
K6c is still unmerged and complete E_max acceptance remains open. ROOT W1 limits,
F2a, S-I, F2b per domain, F3 and the other owner-held choices still follow.


## Owner adopts scoped KF3 comparison; T4 readiness released (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

The owner's actual instruction, after discussion and explicit reaffirmation of
the scoped comparison, is “Then proceed accordingly and carry on from there.”
Adopt R/OWNER_CHECKPOINTS/K6C_PUBLISHED_ROWS_ADOPTION_2026-10-02.md, which binds
the unchanged proposal's five finite clauses and preserves the owner's words.
This removes the comparison-policy hold. Full historical KF3 value equality
remains unestablished; unchanged analytic criteria, available-field checks,
new full-row custody and independent review now govern that finite obligation.
All solver correctness, numeric caps, evidence and merge gates remain.

[Correction to the preceding stopping rationale: ROOT had extended a comparison-
acceptance boundary too broadly to independent measurement collection. Owner
authority was required to replace that protected criterion; it did not require
all otherwise authorized evidence work to stop. The historical halt remains
recorded, without being presented as a mandatory rule.]

The M5 host, existing guard and absence of compiler/solver work are reverified.
Fetch/gh confirms unchanged main3a0251874d6ab38008173a22ef09d651a0f20d9e, merged
A1 PR1070 and closed unmerged PR1066 at its preserved head. Source81c038 and
clean records branches remain. Release only I26_T4_READINESS_09.md under its
25-minute bound: exact-context input acquisitions, no-op and prospective numeric
decisions. No normal solve or R1 process yet. Actual T4 execution requires the
next bounded ROOT grant after readiness; no numeric deferral may be overridden.


## Scoped comparison adoption independently confirmed (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read RV36 comparison_adoption_04 and verified its3-payload seal
1f55f2b355db885a4985d5adbfe701e6a54512f61f45399859ba4c12ab8cbd64.
The decision is faithfully propagated with all five obligations and no further
permission request for that same policy choice. Actual runtime/comparison evidence
and final gates remain. The reviewer confirms its earlier boundary concerned
comparison closure, not all independent acquisition.

ROOT also read I28 closeout_index_03's full draft and obligation map and checked
its informational write inventory. These remain revisable drafting material,
not accepted final D records or a new numerical claim. T4 readiness has returned
and its raw evidence is preserved; RV34 reviews it independently before ROOT
normal-execution disposition. I26_T4_MEASUREMENTS_10.md is prepared, not released.


## T4 readiness accepted; original measurements and scoped comparison released (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read the complete RV34 t4_readiness_06 RETURN and verified its17-payload
seal22f339b27f2973e80f08aa5456053400daba0e71d5fcfbfb062a7c7a49f5e423.
Accept finite input/context/readiness evidence. The review's caller/projection
section reproduces all prospective numeric predicates; its recipe section
confirms unchanged wrapper/reference criteria and mandatory complete Selected-
dump accounting. These projections are not actual future admissions or measured
consumption. The current hold and prior journal remain untouched by readiness.

Release I26_T4_MEASUREMENTS_10.md on the fixed ordinary artifact/source81c038.
ROOT's explicit native dispatch starts60 minutes total: normal solver stop/reap
by40 minutes, no comparator runtime after50, final return by60. This extends only
the separately budgeted post-solver comparison/analysis time, not the normal
execution cutoff or original per-process limits. Use the original wrapper once
and its sole named W1-T4 hold lift, with actual fresh baseline/prepasses and all
numeric predicates. No numeric deferral, cap or tolerance may be overridden.

Only a complete valid normal tier with critical checks passing may proceed to
the unchanged R1 comparator within the separate time bound. Account every first-
pass outcome, require every Selected dump, preserve unavailable/unpublished cases
without pass credit and investigate changed supported KF3 facts. Preserve full
new outputs and all prior journal prefixes. Partial/interrupted/invalid runtime
returns for disposition instead of silently extending or retrying. Existing
M5 guard and sole quiet/timed lane apply; no build or new host tooling follows.

Complete K6c/E_max, final comparison acceptance, exact-head final review/gates,
W1 limits and F2a remain open. No owner decision is re-requested for the already
approved scoped comparison.


## Explicit final-family continuation boundary (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

I26's actual15:25:58 UTC checkpoint has completed orders247–261; TREE ROT
second W1 pass262 has completed three expected repeats and remains active.
All available checks remain clear; the reached high-precision TREE work, not
supporting tooling, consumed the runtime allowance. ROOT explicitly authorizes
a bounded continuation of only original CONT orders263–270 if and only if all
rows through262 finish validly before the original15:30:52 UTC cutoff.

If that condition is met, the same unchanged wrapper may finish those remaining
original rows without interruption, with a new hard normal stop/reap15:40:52 UTC.
No new comparator runtime is allowed after15:50:52, and final return is16:00:52.
This is an explicit additional10-minute final-family runtime allocation, not
compliance with the original deadline or an automatic extension. If TREE is
still incomplete/invalid at the original cutoff, stop there and return partial
without R1. No retry, new model, cap/tolerance/admission/first-repeat/per-process
watchdog change is authorized. Every existing stop condition still applies.
The original grant and checkpoints remain unedited historical evidence.


## T4 author custody and bounded final review (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read I26 t4_measurements_10 RETURN, verified its54-payload seal
9d331a4f6cc9ea637fe24d42a07cf62c69cd4859d0a01f2367ab46ec44d10f84
and committed the owned write set. MEASUREMENTS/W1_T4 preserves all new raw files
plus the full journal, checked byte-for-byte against the author inventory and
the prior immutable T3 prefix. This is custody, not final numerical acceptance.
The author RETURN's scope/outcome, metric-window, TREE-work and comparison sections
retain actual numerical classes, unavailable per-internal-precision heap peaks,
RSS projection misses and unpublished TREE cases. The explicit final-family time
extension and observation limits remain visible. Runtime is stopped.

Dispatch RV34_T4_MEASUREMENTS_07 for independent actual measurement/comparison
review, I28_FINAL_K6C_D_04 for revisable final D assembly, and fresh RV39_K6C_FINAL_01
for full final source/custody/slice review. Native TASKs own disjoint records-only
paths, use their finite briefs and return to ROOT; no runtime or Git/index writes.
Final independent review, exact-head gates and complete K6c disposition remain.

ROOT applied RV38's finite evidence-placement plan only after I26 sealed and
released its paths, before these reviewers started. The relocation ledger binds
all original manifests/payloads/modes and the complete archived historical packet.
Its failed initial archive-mode check was repaired by a command-local standard
Git archive option before deleting the original extracted packet; no Git config,
policy, classifier or sealed evidence changed. The bounded existing-classifier
preflight passes; actual GEN-8 remains. This closes custody placement only.


## K6c T4 measurements and scoped comparison accepted (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read RV34 t4_measurements_07 RETURN in full and verified all31 payloads
under seal282d49093e6ea08c7fc0a72cab150a44371a00be0b9709874014779d2ba1bfeb.
Accept checkpointB's finite current T4 observations and the owner-adopted scoped
KF3 comparison. The review's actual-tier table, source/context/admission section,
matched-memory section, reached-precision/prefix section and independent comparison
section establish the supplied original schedule and numerical checks. Complete
new published outputs and immutable journal prefixes are preserved. Unpublished
TREE cases receive no value-pass credit; full historic published-value equality
and full W1/sparse value equality remain unestablished.

For I21 §4 and K6B §13.5, accept the reached512/1024 evidence at its actual
granularity: per-attempt work/storage plus measured whole-call source/solve/prefix
requested/moving windows that span those attempts. No per-internal-phase or
precision-isolated heap peak is supplied or inferred. This closes the finite
post-KF3 T4 measurement obligation at that explicit scope, not a stronger
per-precision attribution claim or a universal runtime bound.

RV34's memory/policy section establishes eight empirical RSS projection misses,
with no matching H-window breach or configured RSS-cap breach. Disposition:
retain them as mandatory input to the next ROOT W1-limit/policy ruling. The
empirical RSS projection must not be relied upon as an observed-consumption upper
guarantee. This changes no current admission criterion, retrospectively changes
no decision and provides no new runtime permission. K6c's matched heap-envelope
claim and whole-process RSS forecasting remain distinct. No additional experiment
is required merely to relabel the unavailable precision-isolated peaks.

The review confirms the explicit CONT-only continuation condition and revised
deadlines. Its finite monitoring/cleanup credit is accepted as stated; file-write
timestamps and default survivor arrays are not promoted to observations they did
not provide. Earlier T1 monitoring failure, T2 outcome correction and historical
VR/artifact qualifications remain.

ROOT read I28's complete revisable D RETURN, CHANGE_RECORD and EVIDENCE_INDEX,
verified its informational inventory and committed the8 owned files. ROOT now
updates only the accepted T4 reference/status and freezes D for RV39's final
records delta. Complete K6c/E_max disposition, final independent exact-candidate
review, hosted CI/full-SHA dispatch, exact-final-head Mac DEC-025/fresh target and
GEN-8 remain. W1 limits wait for K6c's merge; F2a retains its own adoption/gates.


## K6c D accepted for final gates (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read RV39 final_slice_01 RETURN in full and verified its16-payload seal
b881aef306b4e79414a89923264b0c5266205e93dfd2beea512c88a7061b883f.
The fresh reviewer covers the complete maintained diff and final D/records delta
atcd98b0e903c9c4ebdeff8292f53467b0723f6ea1, with no actionable finding or open
SHOULD-FIX. Accept checkpointD for final gates under the conditional source,
artifact/input and metric-window premises stated in that return. Historical VR
qualifications, precision-isolated heap unavailability and RSS projection misses
remain explicit; no broader memory or numerical guarantee follows.

ROOT freezes the candidate after adding this truthful review/disposition record.
Run existing GEN-8, the Mac DEC-025 driver with a fresh target and preserved prior
raw evidence, plus required hosted CI/full-SHA dispatch. Maintained source remains
81c038. The exact reviewed-source carry and final metadata delta need confirmation
on the actual merging revision. T9/both-entry remain inapplicable to this verified
harness/validation-only scope. No new numerical run or host tool is commissioned.

Only after those exact-head gates and the immediate unchanged-main/head check
may ROOT merge under standing Git authority. Complete K6c disposition is then
recorded with the merge record, ruling and graph in the same pass. W1 limits and
F2a are subsequent work; their decisions are not inferred from this D acceptance.


## W1 decision preparation while K6c gates run (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

Release I29_W1_LIMITS_PREPARATION_01 on the already reviewed frozen K6c numerical
evidence, as prospective read-only preparation only. No W1 limit is selected or
enacted before K6c merges; the standing order is unchanged. A compact source/
evidence-grounded options return will let ROOT decide after the gates, with
fresh independent review of any proposed rule. Keep empirical RSS projections,
matched heap envelopes, deterministic work and wall time distinct. Owner-reserved
product choices and F2a's future caller/reader qualification remain separate.
The native TASK writes only its NUM record, under the stated finite bound, and
returns without implementation. No change enters the frozen K6c PR candidate.


## K6c merged (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

PR1071 merged source9994462204231fb92073e17eb09775756bec22f3 into
main3a0251874d6ab38008173a22ef09d651a0f20d9e at17:46:27Z, merge
49034a940f3f8cd3f3da4d4cbc839943b808063d. ROOT verified both Git parents,
then merged main into NUM by a merge commit. IMPLEMENTATION/K6C_MERGE/RECORD.md
and its sealed gate custody bind the exact reviews, executions and merge checks.
RV39's final metadata/gate confirmation has no unresolved actionable finding.

Accept K6c's corrected conditional H/VR phase accounting, deduplication, caller/
input binding, qualified historical recheck and finite post-KF3 W1-T4/addendum
obligations as closed. All source/layout/artifact/input/metric premises remain.
This does not establish universal private-layout/whole-process RSS bounds, exact
historic VR launches, precision-isolated heap peaks, full historic value equality
or product-facade memory enforcement. Eight RSS projection misses remain input
to W1 policy. Protected criteria, solver semantics and other K6 formulas stand.

Every required final gate covered the merging head; the standing Mac comparison
retains its three platform failures. ROOT's initial target-sharing invocation
error and corrected full rerun are preserved, with no source/criterion repair
claimed. No raw evidence or target was pruned.

The work graph moves to ROOT W1 limits and F2a/S-G1 preparation. I29's prospective
options and fresh RV40 review are read and preserved; no limit is selected merely
by this merge. F2a/engineering/release and the owner's separate product choices
remain open.


## W1 work thresholds selected; memory adoption remains explicit (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

After K6c's verified merge, select W1_RESOURCE_POLICY_V1.md under amended Q5:
20,000,000,000 LME per case and60,000,000,000 LME per actual invocation including
combinations. ROOT read I29's complete RETURN/options and RV40's complete review,
verified I29's informational inventory and RV40's9-payload seal
dcc122932ca5002fb124213249c55e1b3d48602d38965862adff27c47d7a18dd.
The review's option table and source-semantics section independently support this
finite work allocation and its overshoot/cache/unmetered-work qualifications.
No protected numerical criterion, old method label or observation-run policy changes.

This selects work stop thresholds, not hard operation/time/RSS maxima. Preserve
complete actual charges and one meter per request, with shared work charged as the
source defines. F2a must bind/test the new policy; V-P later confirms or revises it.
No proposed-threshold runtime is falsely claimed by the arithmetic preparation.

Adopt RV40-N1 as a required F2a checkpoint0 design disposition. The3.75-GiB complete
requested/moving composition is a provisional technical target, not an enacted
byte guard or deployment choice. F2a must establish its actual source/count/caller/
cache/state/publication composition and qualified preallocation/refusal mechanism;
H's allocator is not that mechanism. Refusal must preserve otherwise publishable
ordinary results/standing under the accepted design. New product semantics or a
published-contract change returns to its owner before implementation.

The work part of ROOT's W1 decision is closed. Final memory allowance/enforcement
and supported-machine interpretation remain distinct owning decisions. Existing
owner-held6-GiB ceilings, PHYS-R4/availability, observation framing, KF3-B1 and KF2
choices are not decided here. Proceed to bounded F2a/S-G1 checkpoint0 planning only.


## F2a/S-G1 checkpoint0 planning released (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

Release I30_F2A_CHECKPOINT0_01 and I29_F2A_MEMORY_PLAN_02 as independent, disjoint
source-only planning blocks on merged main49034a940f with selected W1 work policy.
I30 owns facade/publication/readers and identity/write-set/test proposals; I29 owns
the complete qualified caller/memory-admission strategy and RV40-N1 disposition.
Neither grant authorizes code, experiments, runtime, a new public contract, byte
guard, deployment choice or typed-input reserialization. Their brief time boxes
and return-only scopes govern. No new host tooling is commissioned.

The selected facade order remains F2a atomic with S-G1, then S-I, then F2b by domain
and F3; older D2 grouping language does not silently add S-I implementation here.
M03-INTEGRITY-MP-v2, its private/public distinction and final-row/unit/derived
qualification remain required. Exact-block coexistence and ordinary fallback
standing are preserved. Genuine published-contract/product-semantics changes must
be presented concretely to their owner after independent design review; missing
implementation of an already accepted rule is not automatically a new permission
question. ROOT reconciles the two plans before any implementation grant.


## F2a review disposition and finite derivation grants (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read RV41 REVIEW in full and verified its3-payload seal
c9d05631d7ffaa951fd69f3f6a6831e3c24bcd2be34483f8a49a5330df54ee44.
Accept RV41-1/2 as blockers to implementation/native qualification, not to the
bounded derivations that repair them. RV41-3's ownership/provenance wording is
corrected in the revisable I30 plan; the original author return remains in Git.
No completed allocation/recipe proof is inferred from a plausible strategy.

Choose M1 upfront preparation/batch/caller reservation as the derivation basis,
with newly reachable ordinary work and a third native caller contract added. Keep
typed calls ordinary without fabricated custody. Prefer source-based mixed
combinations and faithful logical-candidate receipts as reviewed; no ordinary
combination withholding, lost verification work or new public radius is selected.
For unsafe native custody, retain a specific representability/registration refusal
for this slice; carry raw inspection as a separate T3 obligation. Do not claim
Current/canonical export or completed native fallback. Representable native W1
still requires its full caller/registration witness. No owner-held deployment or
public correctness-contract change is selected by these faithful directions.

Release I30_F2A_ROUTING_DERIVATION_02, I31_F2A_CERTIFICATE_B1 and I32_F2A_WIRE_C1
as disjoint source/math-only blocks. Each has a finite scope/time box and returns
to ROOT. Full memory P1–P5 follows frozen interfaces, with independent derivation
and review before code. No source implementation, runtime or new host tool follows.

Coordination correction: RV41 returned at19:14:27 UTC; ROOT spent roughly another
half hour on integration analysis before acting. That was a ROOT coordination
overrun, not reviewer lateness or additional numerical verification. The response
is these bounded proof grants, not another open-ended analysis/tooling programme.

[Correction to the preceding disposition's sequence: the initial inventory check
found RV41's additional SEAL.json attestation outside its three-payload manifest.
The three hashes already verified; ROOT then checked and preserved that separate
attestation and applied the stated RV41-3 draft correction in this follow-up commit.
No maintained source or reviewed report was changed.]

## F2a C1: upstream no-wrap premise required (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read RV43's complete RETURN/REVIEW, verified all seven payload hashes and
manifest df6548d30f9652e1d085733c90c042f357347a5e3d0d3c0775c7bc9fd7327b5d,
and preserved it at1da59a785d. Accept RV43-F1 as blocking exact-charge contract
reliance: current SumWork component/aggregate additions can lose overflow history
before later checked projection or saturating totals. No present admitted-workload
overflow or false numerical publication is established by this source finding.

ROOT corrected the revisable I32 contract, dependency/control inventory and RETURN;
its original author revision remains885ed83a6a. Exact receipts require independently
checked upstream no-wrap evidence bound before execution to actual admitted source,
count and build premises, covering cumulative components, aggregates/stages,
unguarded segments and whole attempts/invocations including failed/stopped/reused
work. P1–P5 must discharge that arithmetic obligation explicitly. The byte target,
20B/60B intermittent stop thresholds and small self-consistent returned counters
are not its proof. Without the premise, decline W1 before execution and preserve
the ordinary result. A checked/sticky-overflow counter alternative would require
its own bounded design/source grant/review; none is authorized by this correction.

The same reviewer backchecks the correction. This repairs a contract precondition,
not the still-unprovided upstream arithmetic proof. Source identity/map, terminal
evidence, final-row recipes, complete memory/caller composition and atomic reader
qualification remain open. No maintained implementation or runtime is released.

## F2a finite derivations: review dispositions and next bounded work (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read RV42 REVIEW and RV41 BACKCHECK in full and verified their complete
seals/write sets before preservation at98ea4b9ee7. RV42's eleven-payload JSON
seal is5b392d6b9ac81eec53ebd1a00c32ce16ccc28ab8d4abd1ef9ffec18b08552d4f;
RV41's two-payload manifest isb48ed45c1f9b44ef2cea4e1c812905ba022277a1deb228931ad7b8ac46771698.
The reviews establish readiness of the stated conditional algebra/control
interfaces for further derivation, not completed F2a implementation or memory.

Adopt RV42-1 as an explicit source-warrant completion. Preserve the maintained
SOURCE_ODWALL_EXPECTATIONS reference and source-geometric exact-mode promise.
Separate the admitted K bit-input mechanical problem, intended section functional,
actual rounded operands/output and operational receipt scale. Do not fill the
exact-mode A/Z/r/J cells with convenient stored-bit singletons or I_K/c as the
whole source reference. Bounded positive geometric enclosures are faithful work;
they do not by themselves bridge a changed mechanical operator. Any required
q_K-to-q_G action/source bridge remains unclosed until actually established.
The reviewed immutable view and finite B1 algebra are a conditional derivation
basis; no source-truth reliance or proposed arithmetic-cap adoption is inferred.

Accept RV41-1's guarded continuation/first-terminal/source-debit control direction
and RV41-3's ownership/provenance wording correction. Count routing-observer
storage even on a later exact-selected invocation; the prohibition concerns W1
source/numeric/draft work and new W1 diagnostics, with original publication bytes.
Legacy source WorkReport charges include existing algorithmic reservations; they
are not measured hardware operations. Adopt RV41's explicit correction withdrawing
its earlier inferred provisional headless document: the helper returns None at
this source, while the later qualified-export allocation remains real.

For native derivation, select a transient W1-only reply-admission direction and
the expressly application-owned Rust window ending at guarded owned JSON-body
transfer. Tauri-owned post-transfer queues, WebView and whole-process RSS are
excluded, not bounded by that label. No numeric K or byte allowance is selected.
RV41-B1 must preserve actual first-party retry/retrieval, job/generation/capture and
cancellation state without rerunning the solver or falsely claiming a terminal
result. Success and denied/error paths both need bounded ownership. Ordinary and
exact-source polling remain unchanged. No terminal availability loss or new
deployment claim is accepted. RV41 confirms this faithful new-method direction
fits ROOT's delegated resource scope; no extra owner permission is required now.

ROOT read and verified RV43's four-payload correction backcheck at16b1ba7e3f,
manifest dac3fdb1047f4150cd824e0ac0a6b018c2eedcb1588055bef9a9f23a1a66e8fd.
RV43-F1 is closed as a contract-wording finding at0017eba992; its actual upstream
no-wrap proof remains an implementation blocker. The original records and
arithmetic remain unchanged.

Release the finite follow-ups at84d5c5ecd4: I31_F2A_SOURCE_GEOMETRY_B1C,
I30_F2A_NATIVE_REPLY_COMPLETION_03 and I32_F2A_WIRE_C2, each in its disjoint owned
packet with explicit time boxes. No maintained code/schema, solver runtime,
host-tool work or new owner-held contract change is granted. Independent
backchecks follow their returns. Full aggregate memory/cost proof and code wait
for the concrete closed interfaces; no completed bound is inferred from a plan.

## F2a operand/control backchecks accepted; source-action bridge bounded (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read the complete RV42 B1C review and RV41 native-reply backcheck, verified
their hashes/write sets and preserved them at7a45f14b46 and6c2e5c5a36 respectively.
RV42's six-payload JSON seal is0ff36ab87bb8270833ec150f27e9f42593e6c563ea0c20f22eb7699fe09096d5;
RV41's two-payload manifest is060403ff3c118e401e3c14832708b6151d9111cc7987c5c2e8e65868bdb757d9.

Accept B1C's finite positive source-geometry operand construction, with actual
normalized-source binding required. RV42 independently checked the pi constants
by a different identity, the geometry and width arguments, finite schedule and
all author controls. RV42-1's omitted-warrant/operand-construction cell is closed.
The proposed scratch schedule is not a measured or implementing memory proof.
No universal recipe-fit or new LME price is selected.

The kernel's declared q_K guarantee and exact-profile source response q_G remain
distinct. B1C/RV42 establish that no-pressure displacement/rotation and derived G
belong to the outstanding source-action/operator bridge. Operand intervals do not
close that bridge. Release fresh I33_F2A_SOURCE_ACTION_BRIDGE_01 for one bounded
feasibility/derivation question, preserving all operators and public truths. A
fresh independent design re-derivation precedes reliance. No real solver defect,
new implementation or broader bridge proof is claimed by this release.

Accept the native first-party control basis at I30 native_reply_03; RV41-B1 is
closed at this specification level. Preserve literal W1-only handling, original
capture identity through async work, accepted/refused cancellation semantics and
same-job retrieval. Final validation/identity checks, registration and terminal
claim form one synchronous commit with no intervening await. Ordinary polling
and error behavior stay unchanged. P4 still owes success/error/emergency storage,
actual aggregate denied-request overlap and enforcement, numeric K/allowance and
native tests. No complete native memory or runtime qualification follows.

## F2a counter component disposition and checked-evidence design release (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read I29 RETURN/DERIVATION and RV44 RETURN/REVIEW in full, verified the
author inventory and reviewer seal chain, and preserved them at4c2c1e9857 and
bdfd7ae75c. RV44's twelve-payload seal is
2f89ad1da9e5da9fa47b4ff43f6345708414f4bda22e2de438edc2ce1ca34823.
Accept the reviewed local lemmas and finite usefulness arithmetic only within
their stated premises. Full raw-owner/lifetime, transfer and R1–R8 composition
remain unproved; no complete no-wrap admission or current-workload overflow is
inferred. The partial proof stays useful evidence, not an implemented guard.

Choose a bounded design of the explicit checked/sticky exactness alternative
before further expansion of the global static proof. Release
I34_F2A_WORK_EXACTNESS_DESIGN_01 atfc2bcac067. It must retain evidence loss through
raw counters, weighted/stage/aggregate expressions, clones/deltas, caches,
errors/terminals and invocation projection, with separate count/scalar and raw
accumulator headroom protections. Nonoverflowing prices, values, classes and
observations must remain unchanged. The choice is a design-investigation scope,
not a selected API, a waiver of pre-execution safety, or a maintained-code grant.
Layout/profile/H/VR and F2a memory consequences must be enumerated before any
implementation; fresh independent review follows the finite return.

ROOT also read RV43's full C2 review, verified its seven-payload seal
15fd1dfc45d8e7b6aa2bceeac2fe01b378662b4ced7c5fd5652a6af9107bc1d0,
and preserved it at2200f45465. Accept C2-F1/F2 as blockers to the finite combination
mapping freeze: specify factored operand provenance separately from first-source
metadata, and pre-source refusal without fabricated combined source or Run.
The narrow four-path revisable-draft repair at87ded04a30 is executing; the original
0440ea0777 return and sealed review remain unchanged. These findings allege no
current numerical failure. Same-reviewer confirmation precedes mapping closure.

## F2a C2 mapping confirmed; preparation component released (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read RV43's complete C2 correction return, verified four payloads and exact
scope, and preserved it atf2d6470460. Its manifest is
efad3db761afdc6dc7ab13d166d07e91f1edf87c58d4492b935bf708a3aa98ba.
Close C2-F1/F2 at the contract/type-mapping level. Corrected C1/C2 at0017eba992
and0a4afd6318 form the concrete source/map/call basis for component derivations,
with subsequent reviewed work-status or recipe deltas still to reconcile before
an atomic wire/schema freeze. Names remain unreserved; no implementation follows.

Release I29_F2A_PREPARATION_COUNTS_P1 only for raw census, count safety and source/
preparation allocation/ownership. These interfaces are now concrete enough for
that independent component, with unresolved type/build coefficients explicit.
This does not release the complete aggregate memory proof ahead of the source
bridge, work-exactness design, numeric-phase, ordinary-suffix and caller facts.
No byte allowance, RSS guarantee, new domain or source code is selected. Prepared
objects and actual failure lifetimes must bind the later execution; no duplicate
build is silently outside the accounting. Independent review precedes reliance.

## F2a source bridge conditionally selected; finite arithmetic and recipe completion (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read RV45 REVIEW in full, verified all forty-four payloads and the exact
seal scope, and preserved it atd05bb825ff. Seal:
41db4960bd930d35793fe4d17e621a353e9cd9c36a4aa5b2790c18dca8b27825.
The independent source derivation preceded author exposure. Accept I33's sufficient
source-action bridge at9f1ef2693d as the conditional mathematical basis for further
F2a derivation: exact source/map/frame/load/constraint premises, R7's matching
verification scaling and twice its upward inverse bound, data/zero-block scope,
strict perturbation test and full action-functional change are all mandatory.
Actual output bits, normalized coordinates, classes, scales and accuracy predicates
remain unchanged. Refusal is certificate insufficiency, not a singularity claim.

This closes conditional mathematical feasibility, not implementing association,
finite arithmetic/storage, actual availability or F2a/public-source reliance.
No second solve, new operator, domain or public bound is selected. Missing source
warrants and impossible unchanged-output predicates remain explicit. Ordinary
preview truth is not silently replaced by either the exact profile or q_K.

Release the bounded follow-ups I35_F2A_CERTIFICATE_ARITHMETIC_01,
I31_F2A_CERTIFICATE_B2 and I36_F2A_PREVIEW_TRUTH_01. Their disjoint source/math
packets complete concrete arithmetic, nonlinear recipes and the ordinary-route
warrant respectively; fresh independent review precedes reliance. No maintained
implementation or runtime is authorized. Use minimal source origins/revisions;
RV45's already sealed full source copies remain historical evidence, but future
packets should not duplicate tracked trees without a concrete recovery need.

## F2a checked-work specification selected; concrete API closure required (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read RV46 REVIEW in full and verified its fourteen-payload inventory/seal
chain, seal8147543ca34326e15d88b1232f2eb41e0f50b3090f8f7883a881335e645e9c50.
Accept I34's E/O/I/OI algebra, status-versus-price discipline and independently
checked pre-mutation carry lemma as the checked-evidence design basis. Select
this direction over continuing the incomplete global cumulative static proof.
The local I29 lemmas remain valid conditional evidence and scalar inputs.

This does not lift C1's exactness blocker: the concrete ownership/API/error/reset
and caller coverage, source implementation, scalar admission, layout/profile and
qualification are still required before this alternative can supply exactness.
No code, new price, byte bound or silently changed legacy observation is authorized.
Release I34_F2A_WORK_EXACTNESS_API_02 to choose and fully trace those finite APIs
and exact maintained manifest for RV46 backcheck. No further abstract framework
or open-ended proof programme is requested.

## F2a ordinary and nonlinear bases accepted; preparation corrections bounded (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read RV47 REVIEW and RV49 REVIEW in full and verified their exact payload
scopes/seals before preservation at44a6f7d9cf. Their manifests respectively are
dbadefd645e97be4cda9f05d034c4ec6bb1f8967eb80acbc1ac5f5b0576ef040 and
e5f8a8c377e98e8475b01c09e61ce24949484e6d84032e878d6125ce22805608.
Accept I36's source reconciliation and private dual-readout cover as the faithful
ordinary design direction, conditional on the actual source association and
positive interpolation/coefficient proof. Preserve independent selected E/G and
the actual normalized effective-wall boundary. No exclusive q_K reinterpretation,
E/nu substitution, new endpoint-positivity domain gate or changed reference is
selected. Release I36_F2A_ORDINARY_COEFFICIENTS_02 to close that finite instantiation.

Accept B2 at514f04a943 as the conditional nonlinear/source-span mathematical basis:
strict unloaded W1a/source maps, correct signed endpoints and positive section
premises, unchanged k factors and final predicates. Preserve surviving rows and
the actual coefficient-witness midpoint/location scope; restore no retired open
summary and add no combination maximum. D2 headlines remain result_ref aliases,
not new all-case source-max guarantees. I35 arithmetic, code/association/resource
and actual qualification remain open. RV49 disclosed some pure Git object reads
without the requested optional-lock environment; no index/write-capable command
was used in those reads. Its completion record preserves that procedural departure.

ROOT read RV48 RETURN in full and verified its six payloads/exact scope, inventory
c8d1765e972999c298e179c20710d3241feaa2bd3941396bd52e1ebb34a27309.
Accept RV48-1/2 as preparation-roster blockers and RV48-3 as a checker correction:
account actual failed-verification vector copies during cache import, explicit
RCM sort workspace, and individual malformed-count rejection. Release the narrow
I29_F2A_PREPARATION_REPAIR_02. Preserve original raw evidence. The block-id point
is a conditional guard clarification, not a proved counterexample to the stronger
current product guard. Same-reviewer backcheck precedes roster closure; no numeric
memory/work/implementation qualification is inferred.

## Checked-work code checkpoint A released (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read and verified the final RV46 API path confirmation and RV48 P1 repair
confirmation, preserving them atdfd7a07711. RV46 N1 and RV48-1/2/3 are closed at
their stated API/symbolic-count scopes. Select concrete I34 API-02 at51d8d9fc1e
and P1 scalar/count/ownership basis atb1ebe245ec for the bounded prerequisite
implementation. Actual memory coefficients and aggregate qualification remain open.

The host is verified M5 Max with existing memguard PID5387 and no Cargo/rustc
process. Rust/cargo report1.97.1. A fresh fetch leaves origin/main at49034a940f,
already an ancestor of NUM. ROOT created an isolated f2a worktree and branch
codex/piping-f2a-work-exactness-20261002 fromdfd7a07711; it was clean at creation.
No old checkout, target or evidence was pruned. The existing guard is retained.

Release I37_F2A_CHECKED_WORK_IMPLEMENTATION_A as the first maintained-code block:
checked accounting, scalar/index safety, truthful terminal custody and affected
H/VR readers within its exact manifest. This deliberately touches retained/**;
new layouts require new K6c/H/VR profile correspondence before reliance or merge.
No F2a product publication, geometric arithmetic implementation, new public bound,
domain or source promise is activated by A. Fresh source implementation review,
all applicable gates and full scalar/profile/caller qualification remain required.

One bounded Cargo lane with4 build jobs/2 test threads is granted for compile and
focused controls only; no heavy/gate/model-scale programme follows. The source
implementer owns no Git/index operations. ROOT reads and commits the actual diff.
Remaining coefficient evidence correction, arithmetic/ordinary/B2 integration,
facade cost policy and complete memory/caller work proceed separately. The owner
was explicitly told T3 remains substantially incomplete; design proofs are not
delivered product behavior.

## Fixed arithmetic selected; ordinary evidence correction remains narrow (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read RV50 REVIEW in full and verified its thirteen payloads/exact scope,
preserved at125464d513; manifest
04434d7a38f59858686f9b510cd24d18fe57af293a6b6141d23dd93a93b0e0e0.
Select I35 at2034c050d6 as the private fixed arithmetic design: existing Wide<16>
at1024, existing directed/exact-sum machinery, the bounded directed sqrt and
closed small-bound RU64 method, with original public predicates unchanged.
This is not a complete resource bound. A/U coefficients, callback/loop coverage,
logical-versus-actual storage and all ordinary/B2/work-status integration remain
explicit. No new facade price or allowance is selected by this arithmetic choice.

ROOT read RV47's coefficient REVIEW in full and verified eight payloads, preserved
atdfd7a07711; manifest
6792a5c339edc9272cdc5cad3a9e82dc651ca3102570c3fc682a83b5e6d7226a.
Its conditional interpolation/coefficient/hull argument is confirmed. Accept
RV47-C1 as a required evidence correction: the control rounds CK although the
written theorem correctly requires the exact product of admitted primitives.
Release I36_F2A_EXACT_K_CONTROL_REPAIR_03 in fresh correction records; preserve
the original script/output. Do not credit that defective control until backcheck.
This is not a demonstrated product error or a change to the theorem/predicates.

For checkpoint A, prioritize the coherent checked-work kernel, actual terminal/
meter custody and scoped H/VR gates. Complete C2 origin inventories may remain
a named incomplete boundary at the bounded return, never invented evidence.
The full F2a objective remains; this ordering clarification does not reduce the
final source/reader/guard/qualification requirements.

## Execution status and bounded integration follow-ups (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT verified the I36 correction's ten inventoried payloads, exact replay and
original raw/dependency preservation, and read the actual script/prose diff.
Preserve it at 7bca4a0dfd88; same-reviewer confirmation remains required. The
new checker lifts primitives individually before multiplication and adds a
rounding-sensitive discriminator. It changes neither the written coefficient
theorem nor a product source promise. Original failed evidence remains history.

Release the RV47 backcheck and I35 integrated arithmetic schedule briefs at
9fb9748897 as native TASK continuations. Their actual receipt/deadline facts are
in ROOT_CURRENT. I35 must integrate the ordinary seven-add entry and B2/observable
checks, expose every loop/callback/count/lifetime boundary, and distinguish
proposed reservations from proved coverage. No facade work policy follows.

I37 remains the sole maintained-code writer in its isolated checkout. ROOT
inspected the existing claim_ratio/range_consistent test helpers and authorized
only their fallible-signature adaptation in retained_k4/models.rs. This is not
an oracle/tolerance/model change. Initial kernel, H and VR compile commands
have exit 0 in the I37 packet; the evolving source is not yet reviewed or
qualified. The work graph now distinguishes that actual implementation from
conditional mathematical/design progress. T3 remains substantially incomplete.

## RV47-C1 closed after correction-sensitive backcheck (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read the complete RV47 correction review, verified its exact seven-file
write set and six manifest payload hashes (manifest SHA256
911a8a19c8ea3c3a00674161807b44baa5e37e9dbed94e254803a8015d1cf8c6).
Accept the same reviewer's confirmation of candidate 7bca4a0dfd88 and close
RV47-C1. The independently recomputed four primitive products and delta bounds
match the corrected exact-K construction, and the discriminator fails when
replaced by the historical rounded-product substitution. Original evidence and
theorem remain preserved. This closes the evidence defect only; I35 integration,
source association, actual implementation, resource and product qualification
remain required. No public numerical contract or availability changes.

## Checked-work candidate frozen for fresh source review (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

I37 returned the bounded implementation described in its RETURN, without full
C2 origins, profile qualification or product activation. ROOT read the core diff,
verified all 38 maintained hashes and 138 inventoried payloads, confirmed the
exact write scope with the existing validator, and checked all twelve final B
command records and logs. Commit fdae294643b798c1849da8b2e643085562593686
preserves this source and packet in the isolated f2a branch. This is a review
candidate, not acceptance or merge permission. Source remains outside NUM while
fresh RV51 reviews it under the brief at 3e7e23babe32.

I37 RETURN's final-source table records seventeen focused controls in debug and
optimized builds plus unchanged price/oracle, partial-build, S11 and H/VR checks.
Historical compile/test failures remain preserved. ROOT found the raw borrowed
integer length boundary during its source read; the warranted CountRange guard
is included and distinct from numerical/work errors. Future C2 maps and product
3m/ordinal admission still require their own source changes and validation.

The old K6c memory coefficients do not qualify changed layouts. Release the
bounded I29 P3 ownership derivation at f6f4639d747f with actual receipt/deadline
in ROOT_CURRENT, preserving M1 scheduling and first-occupied cache semantics.
I35 continues the finite certificate integration contract. No host tooling,
new numeric memory allowance, final facade pricing or wider runtime was granted.

## Owner-directed graceful session pause (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

The owner instructed ROOT to find a good stopping point for the session-limit
reset, with ample preparation time, but to start no new work. Apply that hold
immediately. Finish only useful bounded returns already in flight; do not launch
new implementation, repairs, review assignments, test programmes or integration.

RV51 has returned a sealed partial review at 54b4755d2afc. ROOT read it and
verified its payloads/scope. It records no confirmed actionable defect, but is
explicitly not review clearance. Existing checked-work controls passed; the
independent harness did not compile because of its module-path setup. Independent
discrimination and count/index dominance remain unfinished. Preserve the failure
without labeling it a solver defect or a passing independent test. The code stays
at fdae294643b in the clean, pushed f2a branch and is not merged into NUM/main.

I38, dispatched just before the pause, stopped at startup without substantive
source investigation or conclusions. Its two-file checkpoint and instruction
origins are preserved in the same commit. I35 and I29 may finish only their
current bounded packets, then stop; their new derivations will remain unreviewed
until resumption. No code or review acceptance follows from a pause return.

Origin/main was observed at a533dc2d67bcb97460b6fb64be8922b6411de2a8 after
App-v4 PR1072. ROOT checked that the delta from the T3 baseline 49034a940f has
only projects/chirality-app-v4 paths; Piping and its relevant instruction/skill
bases are unchanged. No integration is attempted during this pause. Refresh
and merge main (never rebase) at the appropriate resumed candidate boundary.

## Graceful pause settled; no new work authorized (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

All delegated agents are stopped/completed. ROOT's final host scan found no
cargo/rustc process; the existing memguard PID 5387 remains running. Both owned
checkouts were clean before the final handoff update; their code/evidence are
preserved. No raw evidence, target or worktree was pruned and no merge occurred.

I29 P3 and I35 integration-02 completed useful bounded returns before stopping.
ROOT read their returns and verified exact inventories/scope, preserving them
at 2fc3e8f71df2e140a0a0d50b72305be5d1c5a618. They remain unreviewed and
unaccepted derivations; their synthetic/abstract controls do not supply an
implemented numeric memory limit, facade tariff or product qualification.

RV51's partial review and I38's startup pause remain as recorded above. I37's
source stays frozen at fdae294643b in its pushed isolated branch. Complete the
unfinished review and affected backchecks after resumption before reliance; no
new implementation was started from I35's proposed helper block. The work graph
and ROOT_CURRENT now point to HANDOFF_2026-10-02_SESSION_PAUSE.md. This is an
owner-directed pause, not T3 completion or a new human acceptance decision.

## Owner resumption and bounded review restart (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

The owner explicitly said “You may resume.” The prior session pause is ended;
its sealed handoff and partial packets remain historical. ROOT verified the
M5 Max host, existing memguard PID5387, no cargo/rustc and clean NUM/F2A
checkouts. Fresh fetch leaves main a533dc2d67bc; its Piping/relevant instruction
bytes match the T3 baseline. ROOT merged it into NUM with --no-ff at d01b218e7ad.
The isolated fdae294643b source remains frozen for RV51; no rebase or source
change occurred. GitHub confirms PR1071 merged and no F2A PR exists.

Release the new RV51 continuation, RV50 integration backcheck, fresh RV52 P3
review and I38 native ownership continuation briefs. Each owns a new packet;
no sealed pause record is overwritten. RV51 alone has the focused Cargo lane.
No new helper/product source implementation, numeric resource policy or heavy
qualification is granted by these review/investigation assignments.

## Private numerical helper implementation released (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read I35 integration-02's three detailed design/manifest documents in full.
RV50's resumed interim assessment confirms its section0 two-helper block can be
implemented conditionally against the frozen checked API, independently of full
product/caller/visit-policy integration. Release I39 under brief081cd0e655:
private directed sqrt and finite small-row-bound RU64 only, actual work/error
collection on every exit, independent exact vectors and focused tests. No larger
integration or visit-permit policy is selected. Final fresh code review and RV51
checked-API correspondence remain mandatory.

ROOT created wt/f2a-arithmetic from fdae294643b after checking worktree/artifact
inventory; wt/f2a stays unchanged for RV51. The shared directed.rs registration
hunk will be integrated serially by ROOT. I39 has no Git/index/API authority.
The lane stayed held until RV51 explicitly released it; ROOT verified no cargo/
rustc and memguard5387 before handing over the bounded lane at23:38:41 UTC.

RV50 identified a B64U custody gap: existing Result-only binary64_up returns
no local SumWork. Its correction remains a design interface requirement; never
book a theoretical safety bound as spent work. It does not affect the separate
two-helper methods.

[Correction 2026-10-02: ROOT's resumption-record script at52a57416 mistakenly
wrote the graph text into the revisable ROOT_CURRENT index instead of saving
the updated graph. The index and graph are now corrected explicitly. Source,
sealed evidence, authority and dispatched briefs were unaffected.]

## Checked-work source accepted for working-branch fan-in (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read RV51's completed RETURN and SOURCE_TRACE in full, verified its exact
23-file packet and inventory804993c540d07ffd54c7476405e10e430a46e6a5c31a6bee157180b83a363b0d,
and confirmed the original partial packet unchanged. Preserve the completed
review at4d9358b550. Accept fdae294643b as the bounded checked-work prerequisite
on the stated 64-bit source/consumer scope; no actionable findings remain.
ROOT merged this source into NUM with --no-ff and confirmed maintained core/
validation bytes remain exactly the reviewed candidate. This is local fan-in,
not a main merge or full F2a/product/profile qualification.

The fresh review completes its count/consumer trace and five independent raw/
accounting controls in debug and optimized builds. Import setup failures remain
review-harness evidence, not product regressions. Full C2, other target/profile
qualification, closed count/error maps, memory/caller/availability and required
final gates remain. The source stays frozen in wt/f2a for current P3 reference.

ROOT also read/verified RV50's final integration review preserveddf2ba0a07d97,
seal dc78333a9940897ce0c9066adabf9faf099a64d5977d9af8e44c7eb00c0d4941.
Accept RV50-INT02-1 as required B64U custody correction before full integration
reliance. I35 repair is bounded by briefaff15c8151e; same-reviewer confirmation
will follow. The separately reviewed sqrt/small-bound helper grant remains valid.

## Certificate and ownership repairs closed; code continuation (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read/verified RV50 correction confirmation at1e5434d315a6 and closes
RV50-INT02-1 at contractd2ced80f725f. Select its narrow spent-return B64U design
with actual producing SumWork/status on every exit and unchanged legacy result
projection. This is not implemented B64U or a selected tariff/visit allowance.
ROOT read/verified RV52 backcheck at0a86763d473a, inventory
02dfa48eb66a1e1bee5d8e221563e29f9e523a0cb8f1707c89008584a19b2d09,
and closes RV52-1 atf3af1b800c77. Select the corrected symbolic P3 source-owner
roster, including hats and its real overlap/moving term. Actual profile, C2 and
caller additions remain required; no numeric memory guarantee follows.

I39 delivered two private numerical helpers at82fc4ebdca04. ROOT read the complete
helper/test/generator source, verified exact five-path scope/hashes and final
command results, and preserved its original sealed packet byte-for-byte under
_run_records/original with a relocation map. Fresh RV53 owns review and the
focused Cargo lane; no public caller or policy was activated.

Release I40 under brief14ce35dbe60d for actual native call/run/group/build/cache
origins, preserving legacy numerical core/output and no legacy origin allocation.
The existing f2a checkout merged reviewed NUM records/main at887b790c2a64 and
retains fdae294 maintained bytes. Source edits were held until RV52 completed;
that hold is now lifted. Compiler work remains held for RV53. Product/Prepared
ordinary/serialized maps remain explicit successors to this code boundary.
A context-owned meter is a permitted implementation of the one-invocation-owner
requirement, with truthful increments and no reset/refund; selected registry
identity must bind actual run/snapshot and count its retention.

I38's bounded native source report at0d90e2fe470e is preserved as input for P4/P5,
not native qualification. ROOT read its return/ledger and verified available
source/output hashes. It identifies synchronous dispatch but supplies no adopted
H, complete request-context or emergency/capacity bound. No host tooling or
protocol-policy expansion is selected.

## Numerical helpers accepted; bounded coefficients follow (ROOT, 2026-10-02 UTC)

ROOT read RV53's complete source/numerical review, verified its exact51-file
packet and seal6ebe02c8237ad478da6602113988ea50a06b510c2fca49461f47174f53c9b315,
preserved it at940b1eba9897 and accepts helper source82fc4ebd at its bounded
private-component scope. ROOT merged it into NUM at0a9e874997 with --no-ff
and confirmed exact maintained core/validation correspondence. The reviewer
independently checked every stored reference by integer/rational inequalities
and replayed the focused debug/optimized checks. Raw-log whitespace remains
preserved; it is not a source defect or permission to edit evidence.

Release I41 under briefd89749d309f1: private normalized material/section and
exact-K coefficient enclosures plus the reviewed B64U actual-work seam, using
existing fixed arithmetic. Its isolated f2a-arithmetic checkout merged reviewed
NUM records at8a6ed501655f; maintained source remains82fc4ebd. Product source
identity, bridge/row/receipt/admission integration are explicitly outside this
block. No new source promise, tariff or memory allowance follows.

I40 owns the sole focused compiler lane after RV53 release and ROOT's empty
cargo/rustc scan. I41 starts only source and exact oracle work until a later
explicit lane handoff. Both exact source fences keep shared registration hunks
separate until ROOT integration; neither TASK has Git/index/API authority.

## Kernel origins and source coefficients frozen for review (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

I40 returned eight maintained paths at38798e6ee477ce23bf9bd2a708a1b2e268def5b3,
base887b790c2a64. ROOT read the origin implementation, common core/combine diff,
tests and reservation/ownership return; verified exact source/packet hashes and
five final command logs; and committed only that scope. Actual combined K4LED
is preserved before prep transfer even on unavailable runs; source-record byte
copies and strong selected-prep retention are explicitly unpriced setup/owner
deltas, not zero work. Extracted validation/preparation drops temporary owners
earlier than the prior lexical scopes, a real profile delta. No acceptance yet.
Fresh RV54 reviews the frozen source and holds the sole focused compiler lane.

I41 returned six maintained paths at60375c47472dac26b1ab77536b8e7b9fb0c44ab0,
base8a6ed501655f. ROOT read the complete component/B64U/tests/exact generator
and return, verified the exact scope and39-file packet plus final source-bound
commands, and committed that candidate. The exact singleton c-square uses one
DM as the selected count derivation requires. Component counts exclude still-
unimplemented chord/bridge work. Fresh RV55 reviews source/mathematics while
its compiler lane is held for RV54. No source provenance, price, complete memory
profile or product certificate is accepted merely because component tests pass.

ROOT verification records are preserved at650a84a0f385. Both source checkouts
remain frozen while fresh reviews run; each registration hunk will be integrated
serially after findings are resolved. All product/availability/gate holds remain.

## Origins and coefficients accepted for local fan-in; native bridge next (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT read the complete RV54/RV55 returns, verified exact packet trees/manifests,
and preserved both atf2dd0dd6d4c0. RV54 seal
f413042d48405f1fa927291220f5c0f069a32e2652daabdc061978eca0b3be2f;
RV55 seal b2eec69f69154ebc7916868b1d9e7ad05ae6a4bf22d662cce31430e8812b6400.
Accept native origin source38798e6ee477 and coefficient/B64U source60375c47472d
for bounded component fan-in. No actionable source findings remain. ROOT merged
them into NUM at77d1b640400e and c7252b7d496a with --no-ff; the two module
registrations joined cleanly. Both focused origin/coefficient suites pass on
that unchanged combined source, with commands/hashes/raw logs under verification/
combined_components_01. This is not a main merge, complete C2, numeric profile
or full product/availability acceptance. RV54 removed only its disposable review
target directories after retaining compiler facts/raw evidence/reproduction inputs.

Release I42 under briefe89bb4527a98 on clean f2a-arithmetic57636e987041, which
contains that reviewed combined source. Implement the accepted I33/RV45 full
source-action theorem with actual owner-bound R7/A1 state and fixed arithmetic,
and test small native zero/loaded cases against an independent exact oracle.
A conservative fully-fixed-anchor test may establish sufficient no-data uniqueness
for the initial component; its absence is missing warrant/certificate insufficiency,
never a new domain rule or singularity claim. General PP source and final-row
binding remains unfinished and may not be asserted by a scalar input record.

ROOT prioritizes an early sufficiency diagnostic against unchanged native SI
predicates wherever directly applicable. Distinguish a loose conservative
enclosure from an exact source error that actually exceeds a bound. Neither
outcome authorizes tolerance/source/publication changes; any required change
gets its own re-derivation, review and owning decision. No extra product plumbing
is commissioned while this first numerical observation is pending.


## Native bridge frozen; tighten only through fresh proof (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT froze I42 at4afbac6e613203f93a499b780082b28be37f6c2c against57636e987041.
The exact source and packet scope, final command freezes, and ROOT reading are
recorded in R/verification/i42_fanin_01/ROOT_CHECK.json. No source acceptance or
main merge is made. The author released runtime and ROOT confirmed no cargo/rustc.

I42 RETURN §Observed numerical result distinguishes native source containment
from predicate sufficiency: both witnesses contain52/52 exact references; zero
passes52/52 predicates and loaded7/52, while the independent oracle proves52/52
actual source values pass for each. The45 loaded enclosure failures do not prove
a source-output defect. Keep the baseline, source contract, publication and
predicates unchanged; no universal availability inference follows.

Dispatch fresh RV56 under brief44c0bba693 for independent code and design review,
including the sufficient anchor warrant, with the sole focused compiler lane.
Dispatch fresh I43 under briefa70de5f595 for a bounded tightening derivation using
the frozen, explicitly unreviewed I42 witness. These actual native TASK children
own separate record packets and no Git/index/source writes; receipt/deadline facts
are in ROOT_CURRENT and their packets. Any tightening needs a fresh independent
design re-derivation before reliance. An extra solve/factor application must be an
explicit reviewed proposal with work/custody consequences, not a silent change
to the prior no-new-solve plan. Public-contract changes remain owner decisions.
Further product plumbing waits for this numerical sufficiency investigation.


## RV56-F1 repair release (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT read RV56's complete review, derivation and replay; verified its exact
48-file inventory6ed85406f8808decd87d8926ce7b38e678defbdb207dda3b25a6c919da8c585e
and preserved it atf2b9a89356981c246da2bfbeeecd35193c09d20d. The sole blocking
finding RV56-F1 is confirmed: the relative-radius validator can execute five
sharper-bound arithmetic operations and refuse before the view collects them.
The injected private-radius witness tests the implemented refusal contract;
it is not evidence of public-constructor reachability or a false numerical row.
No bounded source-enclosure or sufficient-anchor theorem defect was found.

ROOT accepts I42's narrow repair plan (PLAN SHA256 ceddf500cb9389eed312ea7facc98bb5801a18d3e1c5ce8666ab0ed263980305) and releases only
retained/adaptive.rs and tests/retained_k4/source_bridge_tests.rs in the frozen
4afbac6e61 checkout. Actual helper work must be collected on all exits through
one execution, preserving numerical order/results/errors and early-zero prefixes.
No other maintained path is authorized without a concrete scope amendment.
Original I42/reviewer evidence remains unchanged. The sole focused compiler lane
is transferred after RV56 release and ROOT's process check; same four-job/two-
thread/isolated-target/twenty-minute walls apply. Thirty-minute TASK block with
checkpoint10/code cutoff20; no tooling or broad run. ROOT freezes the repair and
RV56 backchecks the actual revised source before any source fan-in acceptance.


## Native source bridge accepted for local fan-in; residual proposal under review (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT read RV56's complete same-reviewer backcheck, verified its exact31-file
inventory b2545c71f9472d98e26aab6e7558e9f4d3f0b87eec98b97206314e96e56f510b,
and preserved it with ROOT's repair verification at7b6f82377f60. RV56-F1 is closed
on17ded278c64e0bb96db2b93ec6ebf3a1f1600907. Accept I42 only as the conditional
native source-bridge component, with the independent sufficient-anchor/theorem
review and all source-custody/resource/availability limits preserved. ROOT merged
it locally with --no-ff atb009fb09e2163948f94a70abc297920dd2314109 and verified
exact maintained core/validation correspondence. R/verification/i42_fanin_01/
LOCAL_MERGE/RECORD.md records the local join. This is not main/product acceptance.

I43's proposed tightening is preserved at401ec14c0a73099dc0859835af8c79e09da3a877.
ROOT read its theorem, full exact-control script and interface/work/storage
manifest, verified the29-file packet and final-command hashes, and sent it to
fresh RV57 under brief06b41a0dd96f. The proposal is not selected yet. Its RETURN
§5 exact algebra control retains7/52 loaded passes for sign-only, gives52/52 for
a constructed correction plus full source residual, and7/52 for a wrong center;
no actual retained-factor execution is claimed. Initial input decoding failure
and later changed-live-input guard refusal are preserved; four immutable4af
inputs keep the mathematical basis distinct from the concurrent accounting repair.

ROOT clarified before seal that no-data proves only free-motion zero. All exact
prescriptions, constrained loads and source recovery remain; fully fixed bodies
can have nonzero actions/reactions. The final algebra counter-control includes
that case. No extra factorization, changed publication/predicate/source contract,
resource permit or universal availability follows. Wait for fresh design review
before any reliance on the proposed one-application residual certificate.


## One retained-factor source-residual design selected (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT read RV57's complete return, review and independent re-derivation, verified
its48-file seal844a98c560bb379b64b079d966ab95bcb3c89881fe95ae3edd80243c1dc1a31e,
and preserved it at3576b4c0a0fb578d31fa570de9fd9de8ac53b534. No unresolved
finding remains. RV57-M1's omitted helper visibility hunk is closed by the
independently inspected I44 manifest245e9fb963f6c854c959d104d4387eda76afaca1;
I43's original packet remains unchanged. The review discloses its own corrected
interval-nesting comparison and actual first-observed clock without backdating.

Select I43 proposal401ec14c0a73099dc0859835af8c79e09da3a877 with that narrow
manifest completion for bounded private native implementation. This explicitly
amends the previous F2a certificate plan's no-new-solve restriction: permit at
most one counted solve_scaled application of the same owner's matching successful
verification factor, followed by directed full source residual and recovery at
the actual resulting finite center. Skip that application where the no-data proof
warrants it, while still recovering actual prescribed actions/constrained loads.
No factorization, primary solve schedule, source law, public value, radius, class,
predicate or contract is changed. The new correction is proof scratch only.

The residual theorem must prove the result for any finite center, without assuming
factor/cast/midpoint accuracy. All actual work, failure prefixes and simultaneous
accounting/numeric causes remain; there is no free kernel/facade work or silently
absorbed20B/60B budget. Old three-pass/storage counts do not qualify this route.
The general exact source frame must be enclosed; its rounded cached operators
cannot stand in for exact G. Missing positive interval denominators mean finite
certificate insufficiency, not a new physical singularity/domain claim.

Release fresh I44 under brief245e9fb963f6 only after ROOT joins these records into
the clean reviewed17ded278c6 source checkout and verifies maintained correspondence.
The dispatched base will name that actual merge. Exact source fence,75minute
block/checkpoint15/cutoff55, existing guard and single focused compiler lane are
as briefed. The first priority is an actual factor/cast/center/source-residual
witness against independent source truth, not more product plumbing. The I43
constructed center is not an actual factor result or production expected value.
Fresh implementation review, full profile/work qualification, PP source/final-row
custody and all final F2a gates remain. No universal availability is accepted.


I44 dispatch continuation (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC): the clean source-record join is
157a64b0b8bb4ad4b3170a7f9b249d218c17d529, maintained bytes17ded278c6. ROOT verified
no Cargo/rustc and the existing guard before transferring the focused lane to
native TASK /root/i44_source_residual. Actual receipt01:30:41Z; checkpoint01:45:41,
source-expansion cutoff02:25:41, final02:45:41. Exact fence and return obligations
remain brief245e9fb963f6, no additional source authority. This is an executing
child, not merely a written plan. Other TASKs have stopped; all public/final gates
remain outstanding.


## Actual source-residual witness frozen; product custody checkpoint released (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT froze I44 at6ba653451f9fd27cdb852b7974753a3921f1c483, base157a64b0b8bb,
after reading source/tests/oracle/ownership/return and verifying the exact scope,
packet seal and final command/source hashes. R/verification/i44_fanin_01 records
those checks. The owning RETURN §Verification gives full native source/predicate
results for actual factor/cast/center/residual execution. It is not source fan-in
acceptance; fresh RV58 now reviews the frozen component with the sole focused
compiler lane. Its receipt/cutoff/deadline are recorded in ROOT_CURRENT.

Early ROOT checks caught incomplete predicate diagnostics and separated storage/
identity/count refusals from true work faults, avoided heterogeneous-unit sums,
and required checked successful extraction. The initial predicate logs retain
their narrower meaning; final predicates add exact and decimal conditions without
changing outputs or limits. The first target directory was moved intact outside
the checkout after release, with its relocation record preserved. Equivalent new
test-field cfg spelling leaves the unchanged S11 scanner checking those fields;
its failed run remains. These process corrections create no tool or new allowance.

Release fresh I45 only for a25minute read-only product source-to-verdict interface
checkpoint under briefc30885b8383a. The next objective is an actual PP-builder and
final-row witness using existing B1/B2/I35 designs, not further abstract arithmetic
or a helper catalogue. No code/runtime/reader/schema/IPC authority is granted.
The supplied numerical source is explicitly pending RV58; any later code grant
requires ROOT's concrete source-fence decision and resolved source review. All
profile/PP custody/full C2/routing/gate and owner-held obligations remain.


## Actual residual certificate accepted for local fan-in (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT read RV58's full return/review, verified its sealed161 entries (including
104 literal machine-local fixture symlinks), and preserved it at24f24e98ba8b.
Seal65ac54dca6d877a7042f386a1d58ef89d32d031836b28c3d62001f4c59514db2;
no unresolved finding. Accept source6ba653451f9fd27cdb852b7974753a3921f1c483
at its conditional native component scope. ROOT merged it locally at
9732457720ef3c4376625cca8a707bec1b8e0e44, verified exact maintained core/validation
correspondence, and recorded the join in R/verification/i44_fanin_01/LOCAL_MERGE.
No main/product/profile acceptance follows; higher-P full native witnesses and
original allocation/auxiliary-work qualification remain explicit open work.

RV58 reports an initial clean git status read in the separate92ea checkout
without optional locks disabled; incidental index refresh was not established.
All its SOURCE/NUM reads disabled optional locks and candidate hashes stayed
clean. The record does not make a blanket zero-incidental-index-write claim.
Its frozen fixture includes a source .gitignore symlink; Git emits a nonblocking
ignore-read warning when scanning NUM. Preserve the sealed evidence and source
pin; do not silently rewrite that record to suppress a warning. The symlinks are
machine-local replay pointers, not self-contained copies of the compiler inputs.

I45's nine-file plan is preserved in the same records commit, seal
4737491ba2b0b5743e85ce2f86d7644f6701c2aa8c4d3807096e963df560bb4d. ROOT read
its complete proposed eight-path source-to-final-row slice. Its explicit ordinary
direct/magnitude hull corrects the old Q_K subset Q_S shortcut for I44's distinct
source enclosure; represented/source stress branches remain separate before their
result hull. This affected interface is not selected yet. Fresh RV59 reviews
that warrant and actual PP producing/final ownership under the pinned brief.
No PP code/runtime grant, new truth contract or public activation is made here.


## Product ordinary vertical interface selected (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

[Correction 2026-10-03 UTC: the initial plan/RV59 review did not discharge
G5a operational L/k_a/k_t. A/Z/body extent only covered row scales. The bounded
private correction below was independently re-derived before implementation
reliance; missing operands continue to refuse complete G5a/case success.]

ROOT read RV59's full return/review, verified its12-file packet with seal
a4b3529f686e134482ba1e1797cb44b948d2541bc7a4f125fbd37f96196f3b5f, and preserved
it at5691d7f7b3d0. No actionable finding remains. Select I45 plan24f24e98ba8b
for one bounded private actual-ordinary source-to-verdict implementation. Explicit
ordinary direct/magnitude hull(Q_K,Q_G) supersedes the earlier subset shortcut at
this changed interface; represented/source stress/max recipes are evaluated
separately before their result hull. This preserves existing source meanings.
It changes no exact-profile truth, published value or product contract.

The reviewed final hook is valid for the stipulated ordinary route only, after
all relevant mutations. It does not implement a new W1 projection/routing or
qualify0.4 fallback, combinations, C2/readers/receipt, section_terms or resources.
The expected73 mechanical rows plus ancillary rows are static until observed.
A truthful full-case finite refusal with unchanged ordinary output is a valid
private witness, not a partial success or public selection.

Release I45 under new BRIEFS/I45_PRODUCT_VERTICAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md after ROOT
joins accepted NUM into the clean existing wt/f2a checkout and pins the actual
base at dispatch. One integration owner writes the eight reviewed paths plus
S11's necessary new-module/site registration path; this mechanical addition
preserves existing scanner/assertions/dispositions. No other scope expansion.
The120minute block/checkpoint20/cutoff90 targets actual admission/source custody
first and a coherent full-row verdict next. The existing guard/sole focused lane
and separate absolute FK/PP targets remain; no host-tool work or broad runs.
Fresh implementation review and all product/resource/owner gates still follow.


I45 actual dispatch continuation (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC): clean wt/f2a join
0fdd06a73389908fba87dfb0baef46dd443c4b8c carries NUMa083c1def515 and unchanged
reviewed maintained6ba653451f9f. Source code/evidence writes are confined there,
not NUM or frozen f2a-arithmetic. Actual receipt02:26:30Z; checkpoint02:46:30,
first actual admission/source-map target03:11:30, cutoff03:56:30, final04:26:30.
The sole focused compiler lane was transferred after ROOT's empty Cargo/rustc
scan and live guard check. Nine-path grant and all pending product/resource/
publication limits remain as selected; no additional authority is inferred.


## G5a operand prerequisite corrected; PP inventory follows actual bodies (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

I45 caught the missing G5a operational operands during implementation and held
that path. ROOT read the governing/actual scalar source and commissioned a bounded
same-interface RV59 follow-up. ROOT read the full return/review, verified its12-file
seal d5eaaa52228a44cd38469684f2d1136047b8e4644be5da300f1bc458e38022cc and preserved
it at00bb882c5592. Select that newly evaluated operational-check derivation within
PP retained_product.rs: actual built operands, exact existing operation order and
checks, truthful actual prefixes, no historical field/receipt claim. No predicate,
source truth, public output or ordinary admission changes. The original plan and
review remain historical; their missing prerequisite is now explicit and corrected.

ROOT also grants PP/tests/s11f_site_test.rs solely for actual moved-body retargeting
and new module/site inventory. Existing checks on old compatibility wrappers would
not inspect the new producer bodies; scanner/assertions/protections remain intact.
The exact ten-path fence and G5a obligations are in new
BRIEFS/I45_PRODUCT_VERTICAL_SUPPLEMENT_01.md. This does not grant other source or
runtime work, extend the clock, or accept incomplete G5a/full-case status.


I46 diagnosis dispatch (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC): while I45 completes final checks,
release one25minute exact-arithmetic/source-read question under brief5c068b85940b:
distinguish the observed ordinary-output refusals from any discrepancy that would
remain in the captured native values/section primitives. Its immutable interim
pp09/oracle09 basis is not accepted implementation evidence; no extra solver,
projection, output or public-contract change is granted. Actual receipt03:24:07Z,
checkpoint03:34:07, cutoff03:44:07, return03:49:07. Native TASK directly under ROOT,
only new NUM/R/I46/product_refusal_01 writes; I45 remains sole code/compiler owner.


## Product witness and supporting diagnosis checkpoint (ROOT,2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT refreshed the M5 host, guard5387, origin/main a533dc2d67bc and GitHub
merge facts for A1 PR1070 and K6c PR1071. Those completed scopes stand.
The private I45 witness is not yet independently reviewed. Its author caught
a coherent support component/id binding hole after the first freeze but before
sealing; ROOT granted only that owned repair/control and affected PP reruns.
RV60 waits for a new freeze, ROOT source/hash/scope check and commit.

I46's original diagnosis is preserved at330dc2e405de. Fresh RV61 found that
its supporting G5a guard uses uncoupled resolution operands. ROOT confirmed
original analyze.py:146 and assigned a separate copied-check correction under
brief2b2d2d86473d. Original sealed evidence remains historical; no affected
G5a replay is accepted before the same-reviewer backcheck. The independent
main Rx/numeric finding will receive its disposition after the complete review.
No source contract, predicate, output, availability or product acceptance is
changed at this checkpoint.


I45 final freeze/dispatch continuation (ROOT,2026-10-03 UTC): source52842022cc49
is committed and pushed after ROOT's full core/test/repair read and98payload plus
exact ten-path verification. No independent acceptance yet. Fresh RV60 has the
sole focused lane, receipt03:49:13Z, checkpoint04:14:13, cutoff04:34:13, final04:49:13.
Its external review fixtures may not be sealed as live symlink trees. See
R/verification/i45_freeze_01. I47's selected-material numerical witness is prepared
only; it follows existing I35 §3 after this source review, not a new truth contract.


## Captured product refusal diagnosed; RV61-C1 closed (ROOT,2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT read I46's complete diagnosis and correction, RV61's full independent review
and backcheck, and verified their sealed inventories. The main review is preserved
at1c16016a5239, correctione3e04c6344d2, backcheck62dcd9e1cb25. The correction
inventory is dc9695c4d0cf3037483c5e14a7fa9a1b83b96157586c7d538e8dd02923dd5e9f;
the backcheck inventory is5ea2949146415f7aba99e181a4ae255b4c5fd50d267245b477b1c1e153bde60e.
Close RV61-C1. Original I46 supporting G5a arithmetic remains historically
inaccurate; read it with the separate correction. Original sealed bytes, all
other analysis results and the complete Rx witness remain unchanged, as verified
by the same reviewer. No numerical source repair is claimed by this records fix.

Accept the bounded diagnosis in I46 original RETURN §§Ordinary versus retained
point results, Decisive exact Rx counterexample, and Nearby dual-cover
incompatibility, with RV61 REVIEW's precise fixed-scale/only-Rx-varies limits.
The actual retained Rx is correctly rounded for the admitted K law but fails
the geometric-source sharper predicate. Ordinary recovery misses and the
section-source discrepancy are distinct. Do not call this a false native q_K
publication or an executed false W1 product publication. Do not claim an all-pass
source transfer for a future projection preserving these captured native values.
Additional solver precision alone cannot discharge this particular discrepancy.

The existing selected I33/I35 conditional route permits a truthful finite refusal;
that permission is not an availability exemption. No new owner decision is needed
merely to finish/review the already authorized private refusal witness. RV60 still
owns independent review of I45's actual source/rows/custody/accounting/complete
verdict. A later product projection must be actually executed and checked across
its final complete row universe, with unchanged source/predicates and truthful
refusal. Any proposed change to protected truth, tolerance, output/operator
contract or required availability remains an owner decision on concrete reviewed
evidence; affected acceptance/merge is held at that boundary. This ruling grants
no public activation, protected availability, resource qualification or T3 closure.


I48 dispatch (ROOT,2026-10-03 UTC): release the20minute read-only availability-
warrant check in brief615fdf5fae78 alongside RV60's code review. Actual receipt
03:53:07Z, checkpoint04:01:07, cutoff04:08:07, return04:13:07. Its sole evidence
scope is R/I48/product_availability_01; no source/runtime/tooling or new contract.
The purpose is to locate the actual owner-decision boundary, not infer a new
availability exception from the accepted conditional private-refusal witness.


## RV60 validator findings and next bounded repair (ROOT,2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT read the full fresh review a231fb5d0230 and verified its45payload seal
d2c7be29ca2114ff5291637e2f572bd9a7b9523f4dca8ffa9376d64c2c1fa204. Hold I45
fan-in on RV60-F1/F2. ROOT independently read the existing reader's closed shape
checks and ordinary mode producer's fixed sign string; these are existing-contract
corrections, not numerical/source design amendments. Release the two-file repair
under briefed0dbbc0671d, actual receipt04:04:44Z, checkpoint04:14:44, cutoff04:24:44,
final04:34:44. After RV60 release and ROOT's empty compiler scan, the sole focused
PP lane transferred to I45. Same RV60 backcheck precedes reliance. No value, zero
sign, predicate, old reader or protected test is changed to produce a pass.

RV60 independently confirmed the actual original specimens' numerical/G5a
outcomes and prefixes. Its deliberately mismatched internal request/capture probe
is retained as a future C2 boundary; the actual single observed(raw) producer
forwards its matching parse pair. This is not arbitrary-pair custody qualification
or a new raw-identity token. The repair does not expand to that separate seam.

I48's short availability-warrant comparison is preserved74e9f4049e76. ROOT read
its complete return, the decisive original owner/design clauses and concrete
protected input differences, and verified7payloads plus33pinned source origins.
It confirms the existing boundary as planning evidence: this conditional private
refusal is not a demonstrated protected-availability regression, and grants no
exemption. Public F2a selection/coexistence/native requirements, later retirement
and PHYS-R4 remain distinct. A complete actual projected specimen and an actual
required-success public input/route are different witnesses. No new contract or
availability ruling is needed for I47's already prepared selected-material test
step after current repair/backcheck; public changes retain their owning decisions.


RV60 repair freeze/backcheck (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC): ROOT read the complete
two-file repair and verified its 28 payloads, final source-bound PP checks, 586
untouched core files and the original 98 I45 payloads. Candidate
28ac57891cd5786e8f84d28f54aa7f1581f69402 is frozen; no acceptance yet. I45
released runtime at 04:14:10 and sealed at 04:15:17. Same RV60 reviewer received
the unchanged-control backcheck at 04:16:32Z, checkpoint 04:26:32, cutoff 04:36:32,
return 04:41:32. New owned evidence is R/REVIEW_RV60/product_vertical_repair_02;
new external overlay and separate PP target preserve all earlier records.
Only the focused lane transferred after ROOT's no-compiler/live-guard check.


## I45 private product certificate accepted and locally merged (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT read the complete RV60 backcheck preserved at 6c641f94de52 and verified its
28-payload seal 27c9ceb50ec3e0758a04bd755db452a932c64cfafb732ffa0e88516703bcac71.
RV60-F1 and RV60-F2 are closed on source 28ac57891cd5786e8f84d28f54aa7f1581f69402. Accept that reviewed source
for the bounded private ordinary base-material source-to-complete-verdict scope.
ROOT locally merged it at 1d19eb51ba1a31b8507439ec9c191eeac14bdc9f, with exact maintained core/validation tree
correspondence and no source conflict. R/verification/i45_fanin_01/LOCAL_MERGE
records the join. This is not a main merge, public W1 selection or F2a acceptance.

The unchanged review discriminator now stops at its old invalid-mode unwrap;
its raw result remains seven passing tests and one expected failure, exit 101.
It is evidence of the repaired rejection, not a green suite. Fresh valid candidate
and accounting controls pass; source-bound author optimized/S11 evidence stays
labelled as author execution. Original actual numerical/G5a outcomes remain
identical; see RV60 backcheck RETURN and REVIEW for their exact figures/bases.

Both actual private cases truthfully refuse. No ordinary value, zero sign,
predicate or old oracle changed. The internal arbitrary raw request/capture pair
and dynamic mode-basis text remain explicitly unqualified beyond the traced
matching actual caller. Public C2/receipt custody cannot rely on that mode-only
check as an identity proof. All public, resource, availability and owner gates
remain. Continue with prepared I47's actual selected-material numerical witnesses
under the existing I35 plan, after ROOT provides a clean updated CODE base.


I47 source join and dispatch (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC): ROOT no-ff merged accepted
NUM cd9110cc5412 into CODE at 0215e471d293, verified clean exact maintained source
28ac57891cd5, and actually spawned /root/i47_selected_material from a fresh
selective TASK context. The one maintained test-file fence and actual selected-
material witness are in brief f737a96abc83; the runtime lane transferred only
after the empty compiler/live guard scan. R/verification/i47_dispatch_01 records
the local join/dispatch. No new source/output/predicate or availability policy.


## Selected-material ancillary completion selected (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

I47's tests-only first actual executions found the missing modulus_basis_record
binding before any final certificate or G5a ran. ROOT read the complete new test
diff and blocker return, verified the 57-payload seal, exact one-file scope,
source-bound expected failed regressions and preserved original test prefix, and
committed the unaccepted blocker at CODE 58912a48b3fb. It is not merged into NUM.
The packet remains a failed required-witness result, not a numerical-predicate
refusal or selected-material qualification. The overinclusive --lib s11 run and
its old fallback-byte failure remain disclosed; the intended site target's pass
does not erase it or establish causation. No broad baseline or old-test repair
is granted. ROOT also identified the copied unexecuted row35 expectation as
inapplicable after the actual prepended ancillary row.

ROOT read RV63's complete independent interface review, preserved at 08a4e9017de5,
and verified its 12-payload seal 9a1f143df434a5aee89d8cadb3613aae8ca91a4693d8e9edc3d81ae4415dd03e.
Select its full sufficient rule before implementation reliance. Expected selected
status comes from the actual case independently of optional capture presence.
Selected requires one successful aggregate source-text capture and one final
modulus row; base requires neither. Capturing only per-material success is
insufficient. Keep actual case/selection association, full producer-defined
metadata and dynamic text equality, mandatory solver-mode coverage, and a distinct
at-most-one typed modulus recipe that contributes no mechanical scale/class.
Derive row associations and failure ordinals from the actual roster.

Authorize the exact four-file completion in brief f8d1bf148464. The retained/**
touch is the private enum/coverage/nonmechanical-verdict seam only; no numerical
publication arithmetic, resolver rule, public output or D2 published contract
changes. New capture storage and work remain explicitly unqualified for public
resources. The actual matching caller/future C2 limits remain. Fresh RV62 covers
the eventual cumulative four-file code/test/independent-oracle diff before any
fan-in. Original sealed evidence and actual ordinary values remain unchanged.


I47 actual source-completion dispatch (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC): the separate
four-file grant f8d1bf148464 was received at 04:43:36Z on clean CODE 58912a48b3fb.
Checkpoint 04:53:36, first complete verdict 04:58:36, cutoff 05:13:36, final
05:23:36. Only new selected_material_02 evidence may be written; the original
blocker remains sealed. The existing guarded focused lane transferred after
ROOT observed no compiler processes. Fresh RV62 implementation review remains
required. This is an actual native TASK continuation, not just a written brief.


## Selected-material implementation freeze and conservative-refusal check (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT read the full four-file I47 completion and oracle correction, verified its
58-payload seal c6d0a1ee33ff09fb038d4ece5735264d2c704d70cf4695ff0818b1f7a22abb9d,
source-bound command maps and preserved blocker/original tests. Candidate
d0daa18717f8243a7232e898c9ef9b4f4d18d9e4 is committed in CODE, not accepted
or merged into NUM. ROOT's first verification compared the declared changed-source
digest to the full inventory path; the corrected artifact lookup verified both
without editing evidence or making a prior Git mutation.

The new selected oracle initially assumed the base specimen's absence of
conservative refusals generalized. That assumption is withdrawn only in the new
owned oracle. The selected conditional certificate permits such refusal; source
truth, predicates, scale/class checks and false-pass rejection remain unchanged.
ROOT additionally checked every actual candidate passing predicate against its
independent truth upper bound, with no undecided interval accepted. The exact
figures and distinct categories are in I47 selected_material_02 RETURN §Actual
outcomes; no internal-interval reconstruction or availability success follows.

Fresh RV62 received the complete cumulative source/records review at05:04:23Z,
checkpoint05:14:23, cutoff05:24:23, return05:34:23, and holds the sole focused
compiler lane after I47/ROOT process release checks. Its fresh review is required
before fan-in. Separately I49 received brief19703b23a89e at05:09:07Z, checkpoint
05:17:07, cutoff05:24:07, return05:31:07. It investigates one conservative UX
predicate through exact arithmetic and pinned source only, with no compiler lane,
source change or broader numerical programme. Its purpose is to determine the
next numerical/producer dependency rather than assume more solver precision or
more facade plumbing is the remedy. All public/owner-held boundaries remain.


## Selected-material component accepted and locally merged (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

[Correction 2026-10-03 UTC, ROOT: the independent truth-miss/conservative
classification cited below covered K and source-annulus with exact interpolated
moduli. I36 also requires the source-annulus interpretation with actual resolved
moduli. That additional comparison was not independently included. The prior
47-row category is relative to the two checked readouts, not established for the
complete accepted cover. Broader truth-coverage reliance is reopened pending
separate corrected evidence and backcheck; no source-code defect or false PASS
is established by this gap. The bounded source/custody acceptance remains distinct.]

ROOT read complete fresh RV62 REVIEW/RETURN preserved at 8b2d87ca7b68 and verified
its 59-payload seal 5824e5240417871bdb6779c2f6bab816f9a456bded71f419f9978e76322cc7bf.
No actionable finding remains. Accept source d0daa18717f8243a7232e898c9ef9b4f4d18d9e4 at its bounded private
selected-material source-to-complete-verdict scope. ROOT no-ff merged it locally
at 21ca7af33b68ca3be833403e700640f4f02606c2; maintained core/validation trees match exactly with no source conflict.
R/verification/i47_fanin_01/LOCAL_MERGE records the join.

RV62 independently checks all actual mechanical truths, source/represented material
semantics, raw/SI predicates, scales/classes/bounds, G5a and observables, with
certified upper bounds for every actual candidate passing predicate. Its owning
RETURN and REVIEW distinguish actual truth misses from conservative refusals.
All complete cases still refuse; no private endpoint reconstruction, successful
protected availability, public route, C2/resource qualification or main merge
follows. The old overinclusive S11 failure and reviewer decoder-development
failures remain historical. Cumulative raw-evidence whitespace is disclosed; no
sealed logs or excerpts are rewritten to make a source diff check look green.

The next numerical dependency is I49's separately sealed conservative-refusal
derivation. Its reported material-hull/shared-radius mechanism is not adopted
until fresh independent review. Do not infer that native projection, more solver
precision or changed source semantics cures it. Existing numerical/source/output
criteria and owner-held public/availability decisions remain unchanged.


## Material interpretation coverage reopened before refinement (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT read RV64's complete one-row proof and verified its 32-payload seal, preserved
at 62f502b80454. Its geometric inflation lower bound, the two stated point
comparisons and algebraic native-projection equality are independently supported.
The proof remains valid. Before selecting a tighter method, ROOT re-read I36's
accepted source-material warrants and found the additional resolved-moduli/source-
geometry readout missing from that point comparison and I47/RV62's truth taxonomy.
The existing H_E/H_G cover cannot be narrowed by calling K's rounded section the
same readout. ROOT's exact coverage challenge is preserved at 26160e94661e.

For the same UX, ROOT's preliminary additional readout misses the sharper bound.
Do not seek to admit that unchanged row by merely tightening the certificate
until this consequence is independently checked. Preserve all original proofs,
scripts and captures. No public source meaning, output or predicate is changed.
I47 has a records-only all-row cover completion, actual receipt05:57:32Z,
checkpoint06:05:32, cutoff06:15:32, return06:22:32. I49 has the narrower readout/
planning addendum and at most one genuinely conservative UZ target, receipt
05:57:46Z, checkpoint06:02:46, cutoff06:07:46, return06:12:46. No compiler/model/
solver/native/source/Git/index/API or tooling work is granted to either. Same
RV62 and RV64 independent backchecks precede closure.

Process observation: ROOT spent too long exploring possible refinements before
settling this full-cover premise. That exploration is stopped. No tighter method
is selected or implemented; the active numerical work is the two bounded evidence
corrections. This records ROOT's own coordination error and correction, without
attributing it to the owner or changing any standing instruction.


## Full-cover corrections preserved for independent backchecks (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT read I49 full_truth_addendum_02 RETURN/checker and verified its26 payloads,
preserved4987f8290fbd. ROOT read I47 source_truth_coverage_03 RETURN/METHOD/checker
and verified24 new payloads,58 unchanged prior payloads and4 maintained source
hashes in CODE and NUM, preserved997e5e7992ee. The owning returns correct only the
required-truth evidence/consequence; their source, captures and candidate outcomes
are unchanged. These preservation commits do not themselves accept the correction.

Same RV64 received its records-only backcheck06:06:16Z (checkpoint06:13:16,
cutoff06:20:16, seal06:26:16). Same RV62 received its records-only backcheck
06:10:09Z (checkpoint06:18:09, cutoff06:28:09, seal06:35:09). Each owns only its
new review packet, uses the existing instruction basis, and may not change source
or execute Cargo/model/solver/native work. No new algorithm is selected. Their
original reviews and all sealed author evidence remain historical and immutable.

ROOT refreshed host/process state: M5 Max,137438953472 bytes, existing guard5387,
no cargo/rustc. gh reconfirms A1 PR1070 and K6c PR1071 merged at their recorded
commits. Fetch found main381be775ae9b, App PR1073; its delta from a533dc2d67bc is
confined to projects/chirality-app-v4. No Piping or instruction basis changed;
ROOT will join that unrelated update at the next clean boundary.


## Readable recovery summary and F2a branch roles (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT is making the next F2a publishing milestone and branch boundaries explicit so numerical progress can be judged without reconstructing every component record.

This applies the owner-supplied advice from the previous T3 ROOT prospectively.
It changes execution planning and record presentation, not a numerical contract,
standing gate or instruction file. Start with the short
[ROOT_CURRENT](RESUME_2026-09-30/ROOT_CURRENT.md) and
[glossary](RESUME_2026-09-30/GLOSSARY.md). Earlier sealed evidence and rulings remain
historical; this summary does not replace their qualifications.

**Recovery from 2026-09-30 to now:**

- The audit identified a real defect in the published-scale proof. C17 supplied
  an actual false-publication witness, ending that search. A fresh independent
  design re-derivation preceded the correction. A1 reached main in PR1070 at
  `3a0251874d`, after its required gates. The audit finding is closed on that route.
- The earlier response PR1066 was closed without merging. The owner caught and
  stopped its tooling drift. Its material remains selectively usable evidence,
  not accepted numerical remediation. Preserved raw Mac evidence was not pruned.
- K6c reached main in PR1071 at `49034a940f`. Its conditional accounting and
  finite measurements retain their explicit limits. The owner-approved scoped
  KF3 comparison does not establish historic published-value equality.
- F2a, the retained-precision product-facade slice, is still incomplete. Reviewed
  arithmetic, source-certificate and actual product-capture components are
  integrated locally. Every complete private witness still refuses; none is a
  successful public F2a publication. Correct refusal is evidence, not availability.
- ROOT caught incomplete material-truth coverage before selecting a further
  tightening method. The original comparisons and shared-radius proof survive
  at their stated narrower scopes. The author corrections and same-reviewer
  backchecks now determine the complete truth taxonomy. No public source
  interpretation, value, predicate or allowance was changed.

**Branch roles are now explicit.** `codex/piping-numerical-integrity-20260926`
is the F2a **code integration branch**. It also retains development records, so
it must never be submitted directly as a records-only PR. ROOT verified its
non-execution diff against fetched main is nonempty. The component branch
`codex/piping-f2a-work-exactness-20261002` supplies bounded reviewed changes.
No current branch is designated a clean records-only PR branch.

Any records PR will start from current main and contain only the deliberately
selected execution-record paths. Before opening it, this command must print
nothing, using that actual candidate branch:

```sh
git diff --stat origin/main...<records-branch> -- . ':!projects/chirality-piping/execution'
```

No local code fan-in implies main acceptance. F2a code reaches main through its
own product PR, with independent review covering the actual candidate, hosted
CI and full-SHA dispatch, exact-final-head Mac DEC-025, GEN-8, T9 and the both-entry
gate. The existing immediate main-movement check and post-merge records remain.

**First publishing target:** the named synthetic skew cantilever
`RF-SKEW-T-CANT-OFF-122-r1e-04`, through the actual captured entry in both solver
modes, publishing under `M03-INTEGRITY-MP-v2` with the unchanged strict predicates
and independent reference agreement. The accepted typed entry has no actual
request capture and keeps its ordinary route; its both-entry accuracy/standing
gates remain mandatory. This target does not grant a new custody-bearing API.
I48's RETURN table and I30's checkpoint-0 PLAN section2 provide these existing
input and entry boundaries. Current pressure-control tests retain the named
`NUMERICAL_INTEGRITY_UNRESOLVED` refusal and required no-pressure publication;
no broader PHYS-R4 decision is made here.

This target is planned, not demonstrated. The next component assignment begins
by binding the actual authorable input, natural routing, complete output roster
and numerical obstacle. If a required-publication conflict is established, bring
reviewed options to the owner rather than redefine success. Certificate tightening
is deferred unless it advances this target. Use one implementer through bounded
checkpoints for the coherent component, retain its reviewer for corrections,
and obtain fresh independent review of the final PR. No implementation grant is
created by this planning paragraph.

New evidence packaging will be proportionate: commit readable summaries, decisive
outputs, small inputs/scripts and manifests of SHA-256, byte size and preserved
location. Keep bulk logs/case dumps in the existing scratch/archive area unless
an owner requirement calls for Git. Every future PR body will state committed
record-file count and bytes with a reason. No mass evidence migration, pruning,
archive tooling or rewrite of sealed packets is commissioned.


## UX correction and conservative UZ witness accepted (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT accepts the corrected UX diagnosis and one genuinely conservative UZ refusal, so further work cannot mistake a real accuracy miss for certificate overestimation.

ROOT read the full RV64 corrective RETURN and verified its sealed payloads,
preserved at `1c7902c73a`. The reviewed I49 addendum is at `4987f8290f`. RV64's
sections “Existing cover and the corrected UX conclusion” and “UZ is conservative
throughout the positive cover” independently establish the different outcomes:
resolved-modulus/source-annulus UX genuinely misses both sharper allowances;
actual UZ has exact zero truth throughout the full positive cover but the shared
certificate radius forces refusal. The old inflation proof and its narrower
point comparisons remain valid. The original tightening-only UX recommendation
is withdrawn, without rewriting its sealed historical record.

No numerical source, published value, scale, predicate or source interpretation
changes. No private endpoint or radius was reconstructed. This accepts the
evidence correction, not a new method, zero recognizer, public availability or
F2a completion. RV62's separate all-row backcheck remains open. A refinement is
selected only if its reviewed contribution advances the named publishing target.


## Complete material truth coverage accepted (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT closes the material-coverage evidence gap, allowing the next assignment to target a real publishing dependency without relying on the incomplete earlier taxonomy.

ROOT read the full RV62 corrective REVIEW and RETURN, preserved at `bcae30c6b0`,
and verified every committed payload and the external exact-result file against
its size/hash/location manifest. The reviewed author addendum is `997e5e7992`.
RV62's “Correction and result” section checks all 292 mechanical rows and 562
applicable predicates in the four fixed captured cases. All 390 candidate PASS
predicates have certified full-cover upper bounds. Exactly the interpolated UX
row changes classification: the loaded interpolation case has 20 truth-miss and
46 conservative rows. These are fixed-case figures, not public availability.

Accept that correction and its finite corner/static/zero proof at the stated
scope. Earlier two-readout comparisons and separate source/custody acceptance
remain intact. No source defect or new runtime test is established. Every complete
private case still refuses. The one-row RV64 correction is already accepted;
no tighter method follows automatically from either backcheck.

ROOT joined fetched main `381be775ae` into the code integration branch by merge
commit `91a143142c`. The merge has no Piping, Root/role or project-skill change.
This is a local integration merge, not a product merge into main.

For the named publishing target, source inspection identifies the next concrete
barrier: the existing private adapter explicitly rejects a nonempty global-spring
list and does not populate support spring ownership. The target already has an
actual authorable request and both-entry/both-mode D-5 test in
`product_physics/tests/formation_check_runtime.rs`. Those source facts are not a
fresh test execution. Prepare I50's coherent component through checkpoints 0, A,
B and D; only the bounded source/contract checkpoint 0 is executable. It must
resolve per-support identity/action and accounting before any implementation
grant. Further certificate tightening is deferred until the actual target
demonstrates that it is the relevant numerical obstacle.


## Named-case component dispatched (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT has dispatched I50 to resolve the spring/support producer barrier that prevents the named first-publishing case from reaching a complete private verdict.

TASK `/root/i50_named_case_component` was actually spawned through native
delegation with fresh selective context and no descendants. It received brief
`fa1439c425` at 06:18:21Z. Checkpoint: 06:28:21Z; new-analysis cutoff: 06:38:21Z;
sealed return: 06:48:21Z. Only checkpoint 0 is executable: source/contract review
and the concrete component manifest. No source, compiler or model execution is
granted. Its owned return is `I50/first_publishing_component_01`; any bulk belongs
in the specifically granted external scratch directory with a committed manifest.

ROOT will select the exact source fence before implementation and retain I50
through subsequent component checkpoints. The target remains actual captured
F2a publication in both modes, with typed-entry coexistence and full gates.
The current assignment moves that target forward by resolving a demonstrated
producer dependency; it does not establish public publication or a completion date.


## Named support interface held for independent review (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT has preserved I50's concrete component proposal and commissioned independent review before its new private support-row law is implemented.

I50 checkpoint 0 is preserved at `848981f433`. ROOT read the complete RETURN
and source checker, verified the current packet and its maintained-source
comparisons, and inspected the actual spring builder and selected support-law
warrant. The RETURN's “Concrete proposed source fence” names six files; its
“Census, controls and next checkpoint” keeps all counts explicitly static and
requires actual named-case execution later. No numerical tightening is proposed.

The packet discloses that its first seal and three provenance payloads were
replaced while distinguishing the initial ROOT_CURRENT snapshot from ROOT's
later dispatch update. Those original overwritten bytes are not claimed preserved.
Their recorded hashes and transcript remain, and a separately sealed addendum
records the event. ROOT verified the retained final bytes. This is a provenance
qualification, not a reason to relabel the earlier seal as preserved or to rerun
unrelated numerical tests. Future checkpoint briefs explicitly say to seal only
after final audit and record later corrections in separate addenda.

Fresh TASK `/root/rv65_named_support_component` received its actual native
delegation at 06:29:57Z, under brief `f58de3f5cc`: checkpoint 06:37:57Z, cutoff
06:47:57Z, return 06:54:57Z. Its scope is the source/interface law, exact fence,
coverage compatibility, support ownership, accounting and proposed controls. It
has no compiler/model/source/Git write authority. I50 remains the implementer
for the component's later checkpoints; implementation is not yet granted.


## Named support component selected with RV65 corrections (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT selects the reviewed support component with both required corrections so the named skew case can reach a complete private certificate without bypassing support scales or coverage.

ROOT read RV65's full REVIEW/RETURN and verified its sealed packet, preserved at
`c1331b5764`. Its verdict is FINDINGS, not unconditional clearance: RV65-1 names
the omitted PP G5a consumer; RV65-2 resolves legacy Native coverage ambiguity.
The reviewer independently re-derived the existing support-law warrant and
explicitly permits resolving these plan findings by selecting its exact
dispositions in the same six-file grant, without another mathematical redesign.

Select **both dispositions in full**, as written in RV65's “Required corrections
for the implementation brief” and in BRIEFS/I50_NAMED_SUPPORT_IMPLEMENTATION.md.
Every support component remains mechanical and participates in FK and PP final
scales, existing coupling, zero/sign rules and unchanged predicates. Only the
attributed recipe fills its group/component slot; direct Native quantities keep
independent native coverage without aliasing that slot. Duplicate contributors
and missing attributed slots remain distinct failures. The implementation must
prove these conditions with the specified controls; no code-review clearance is
claimed now. Same RV65 will confirm them on the actual frozen implementation.

The authorized retained/** touch is confined to the private final-case recipe
and coverage seam. There is no kernel publication, public D2 contract, source
meaning, output producer, predicate, routing or availability amendment. Existing
finite-law warrants suffice at this narrow scope. The exact named fixture bytes
and all protected ordinary expectations remain unchanged.

I50 receives checkpoints A/B/D for this coherent component, with a sixty-minute
receipt-based bound, checkpoint15, first actual named result by minute35, new-work
cutoff50 and sealed return60. Focused guarded runtime only: one Cargo job, four
build jobs, two test threads, locked/offline absolute manifests and twenty-minute
command walls. Bulk new evidence stays in external scratch with committed
hash/size/location manifests. The named case's actual numerical result, not
additional certificate speculation, determines the next publishing dependency.


I50 implementation dispatch (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC): the same TASK received the
selected grant `d7b1711dc6` at 06:40:47Z. Checkpoint: 06:55:47Z; first actual named
result: 07:15:47Z; cutoff: 07:30:47Z; sealed return: 07:40:47Z. ROOT confirmed only
the existing guard was running before assigning the sole focused compiler lane.
The active implementation stays within the selected six files and private scope.


## Dense observation completion selected (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT selects a narrow observation-custody completion so the existing dense-mode output can reach a complete private verdict without changing its numerical meaning.

The first immutable named-run record is preserved at `d87eb0fb59`; all twelve
external files were hash/size verified. RV65's independent delta review is
preserved at `d0acf8ce78`. ROOT read the full review and verified its seal. The
review's “Existing classification and observed correction” establishes sparse
98 final rows and dense 99, both with 97 mechanical rows and native Q58. Dense
includes its already existing parity observation; the earlier mode-independent
98 expectation was wrong. Its no-verdict G5a None was not a performed G5a check.

The adopted D1/D2 table already classifies parity as non_quantity. Select the
review's full exact seven-file delta through I50_DENSE_OBSERVATION_ADDENDUM.md:
add only the specified optional PP lib.rs producer-boundary capture call, actual
mode/value/text custody, independent completed/present state, exact final binding
and separate typed maximum coverage. A missing capture cannot become valid
absence. Mode remains mandatory; mechanical scales and gates are unchanged.
No observation algorithm, source semantics, public route or D2 contract changes.

I50 continues the same component and original cutoff/return clocks. The sparse
full-cover numerical result and torsional dual-readout separation remain author
findings pending independent numerical review. They are not a false-publication
claim or a proof about every future recomputed scale. No projection or further
certificate method is selected on their basis.


## Named torsion feasibility review dispatched (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT has commissioned an independent mathematical check of the actual named-case obstruction before deciding whether retained projection can advance the publishing milestone.

Fresh TASK `/root/rv66_named_torsion_feasibility` received brief `dbffe0d814` at
07:05:35Z: checkpoint 07:15:35Z, cutoff 07:25:35Z, sealed return 07:35:35Z. Its
source/exact-arithmetic scope uses the immutable first-run captures and selected
readout warrants. It must retain the proposed value's contribution to its own
allowance and distinguish actual fixed scales, algebraic native-primary projection
and any broader future-producer claim. It neither takes the runtime lane nor
selects new source semantics, criteria or an output algorithm.

I50 continues the already selected two-mode component. The independent numerical
review and the later frozen-code review have separate purposes; a mathematically
real obstruction does not excuse an implementation/custody defect, and a clear
implementation cannot turn truthful refusal into public availability.


## Named torsion obstruction accepted at its proved scope (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT accepts the independent torsion obstruction and holds the planned simple native-primary projection because it cannot satisfy the selected cover at the checked scales.

RV66's complete REVIEW/RETURN is preserved at `c0c7fa9e0f`. ROOT read it and
verified the six payloads and all manifested external files. Its “Fixed-scale
proof, with proposed-value dependence” proves no common real SharperExact center
and no binary64 SharperBinary64 center at the sparse scale, the scale reconstructed
from captured dense ordinary rows, and the specified algebraic native-primary
projection scale. Absolute classification cannot escape at those normal scales.
The source/K separation exceeds 1.44415e-14 Pa; the exact positive margins and
units are in that section and RESULTS.json. Proposed-value dependence is included.

Accept this bounded result and the source/ledger/statics binding. The original
dense FIRST_RUN had no verdict; its scale here is independently reconstructed,
not an observed certificate result. The hypothetical projection is not an executed
producer. The successful artificial large-scale scalar control expressly limits
the claim: no arbitrary-future-scale or complete-producer impossibility, false
K publication, false public product publication or automatic availability breach
is established. No public truth, criterion, scale policy or replacement fixture
is selected. Tightening an interval cannot remove the proved point separation.

## Named component frozen for code review (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT preserves the complete two-mode private component for independent review while keeping its numerical refusal distinct from a publishing milestone.

I50 candidate `8104a4fedd` is committed and pushed on the component branch, not
accepted or merged into NUM. ROOT read every production/test diff and RETURN,
verified all seven maintained files, the ten-file packet and all 73 external bulk
files (12,147,592 bytes), and checked 950 other baseline files unchanged. The
shared fixture equals the original literal exactly; PP lib.rs changes only the
reviewed three-line observer hook. Verification is at `59a85f6165`. Author RETURN
“Actual result and corrected census” records complete sparse/dense verdicts,
passing G5a/observables and numerical refusal; no public route changed.

Same RV65 received frozen-code review at 07:37:48Z: checkpoint 07:52:48Z, cutoff
08:12:48Z, sealed return 08:22:48Z. Its fresh focused runtime has passed and is
released; source/evidence review continues against the fixed candidate. ROOT's
local initialization-work and counter-range questions are explicitly assigned.
An early local-accounting finding is not treated as a clear review. Any repair
will precede bounded acceptance and receive the same reviewer's confirmation.

## Decision-boundary comparison continued (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT has continued I48's authority comparison so the next numerical step follows the actual owner mandate rather than an assumed permission gate.

The same TASK received brief `39c1cfb2eb` at 07:40:59Z: checkpoint 07:48:59Z,
cutoff 07:58:59Z, return 08:05:59Z. It compares adopted public promises, the
selected sufficient private certificate, actual first-case requirements and
ROOT's delegated correctness/formulation authority. It may recommend a concrete
next design dependency or identify a genuinely owner-held choice, but selects
neither. The selected cover remains binding until a replacement is independently
derived and selected. Code acceptance, numerical obstruction and public-meaning
decisions remain distinct; no new source law or availability exception follows.


## I50 support and observation component accepted and locally merged (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT accepts the repaired private component because independent review now confirms both its source/custody behavior and its local work accounting.

Same RV65's complete backcheck is preserved at `8d025201b8`. ROOT read it and
verified its payloads/external evidence. RV65-I1 is closed by the actual counted
initialization loop and correction-sensitive prefixes; the boolean duplicate-hit
hardening retains the earlier production-uniqueness qualification. No actionable
finding remains at this component scope. Accept source `c79a1c293d` and its
complete two-mode private verdict behavior.

ROOT no-ff merged it locally at `7e9597bd9c` and verified exact maintained
Piping source correspondence. `verification/i50_fanin_01/LOCAL_MERGE/RECORD.md`
records the join. No main/public acceptance follows. Author and reviewer returns
distinguish true output misses, conservative refusals and ancillary observations;
both named cases still refuse numerically. The original code-review failure,
initial dense prefix and all original evidence stay preserved.

## Existing authority and next producer design (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT commissions a replacement numerical design under the actual delegated engineering authority, while keeping every public warrant and current check in force until review.

I48's decision memo is preserved at `0869aa6265`. ROOT read it and the actual
OWNER_PHYSICS_AUTHORITY, CORRECTNESS_ACTIVATION and route-direction records;
origins are recorded in verification/owner_authority_2026-10-03. Developing a
different sound formulation/producer does not itself require another owner prompt.
An unsupported public-meaning choice, protected-criterion change or availability
exception still does. The private dual cover remains selected until a concrete
replacement is independently derived and selected. No check is silently dropped.

Fresh TASK I51 received design brief `36acb1ef39` at 08:08:34Z, checkpoint
08:18:34Z, candidate/obstruction 08:28:34Z, cutoff 08:38:34Z, seal 08:48:34Z.
It returned a source-prepared new-K/two-readout producer proposal, now preserved
at `8d025201b8`. ROOT has read RETURN, WITNESS and INTERFACE and verified its
seal and three external control files. The owning WITNESS gives an analytical
complete-row candidate; no actual producer run, residual-width, new-K G5a or
resource qualification is claimed. Its methods, interfaces and public-warrant
preservation are not yet selected; fresh independent design review is next.

I51 discloses initial read-intent Git status/rev-parse in the inherited 92ea
worktree without optional locks disabled, before detailed brief loading. No
intentional mutation or maintained change is reported, but an optional index
refresh cannot be excluded. Do not assert blanket no-index writes for that run.
All later reads used the required setting; source work used the pinned NUM basis.
Future dispatches explicitly require host/clock only before instructions and
GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0 even for an initial status read. This is run-specific execution
correction, not a reusable instruction amendment or a reason to rewrite evidence.


## Prepared producer independently re-derived before selection (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT has dispatched fresh design review of I51 so the proposed change in actual retained source preparation and product proof is checked before code relies on it.

TASK `/root/rv67_prepared_producer_design` received brief `e85ab6541b` at
08:54:19Z: checkpoint 09:04:19Z, cutoff 09:24:19Z, return 09:34:19Z. Its first
tool was host/cwd/clock only; all Git reads must disable optional locks. It has
source/exact-check authority only and writes its new review packet plus manifested
external arithmetic output. No model/compiler/native run or source edit is granted.

Review covers actual new-K geometry/provenance, both residual laws, complete
projection and public-warrant preservation, the independent analytical witness,
formation precision and p512 floors, immutable staging/ordinary fallback, and
concrete local work/storage/interface requirements. Proposed operation/scratch
counts are not automatically accepted resource evidence. ROOT has selected no
new method or public contract; the current dual-cover implementation stays in
force pending that independent re-derivation and an explicit ruling.


## Prepared producer readiness findings and bounded completion (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT accepts RV67's three design-readiness findings and returns the same component to I51, so implementation starts from an explicit production and ownership contract.

RV67's sealed review is preserved at `ec6e5080f8`. ROOT read REVIEW.md and
DESIGN_FENCE.md and verified all eight payloads and five external files against
the seal and bulk manifest (verification/rv67_design_review_01). The review's
independent mathematics is conditionally verified; its complete named analytical
witness is not a live producer or public availability result.

RV67-1 requires the exact formation/projection process and truthful native p/2p
provenance. RV67-2 requires closed preparation and owner-bound dual-proof APIs
without repeating correction work during final certification. RV67-3 requires one
frozen candidate, actual observable regeneration, atomic transfer and explicit
local work/storage lifetime. These are blocking before implementation. No public
criterion, source interpretation or availability exception is accepted.

I51's correction brief addresses the three findings together, with the same RV67
backcheck before ROOT selection. Its actual receipt will set the forty-minute
box. This is direct numerical milestone work, without runtime or tool development.
Current dual-cover code remains binding. The first publishing target and the
remaining public route, receipt, resource and full-gate obligations are unchanged.


I51 received correction brief `42727b2af5` at 09:20:11Z, with the host/cwd/clock-only
first tool verified by its receipt. Checkpoint is 09:30:11Z, concrete completion
09:45:11Z, new-analysis cutoff 09:50:11Z and sealed return 10:00:11Z. No runtime
lane is granted; the existing guard remains running and no compiler/model process
was active at dispatch. ROOT refreshed GitHub/main during this checkpoint: main
remains `381be775ae`, and no F2a PR is open.


## Prepared producer design completion returned for backcheck (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT has frozen I51's concrete formation, ownership and staging corrections for the same independent reviewer before granting implementation.

The owning completion packet is RESUME_2026-09-30/I51/prepared_producer_completion_02,
sealed at 09:48:46Z. ROOT read RETURN, DESIGN, API and FENCE completely, checked the
eight payloads and external origin-audit output, and verified the twenty pinned
origins. The maintained Piping source still matches `c79a1c293d`; verification is
in verification/i51_design_completion_02. ROOT's earlier unsealed-draft feedback
closed the proposed ancillary observation-bit path and clarified the file fence;
it was not independent acceptance. The packet preserves its corrected early
checkpoint clock attribution.

The completion explicitly replaces the affected product formation process while
keeping native p/P, native admission and every final criterion. It proposes one
owner-bound dual proof, one frozen candidate, actual maximum/alias regeneration,
and non-fallible private transfer. The first implementation milestone is the actual
prepared new-K native solve, before the full overlay. No method, public route,
resource profile or implementation is selected yet. RV67's backcheck is limited
to closure of the three findings and concrete new defects, with unchanged verified
mathematics retained as its earlier conditional result.


## Prepared ordinary producer selected for private implementation (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT selects the reviewed prepared-source and dual-readout producer for bounded private implementation because it addresses the named case's section-rounding obstruction while preserving every publication accuracy check.

The selected design is I51/prepared_producer_completion_02 at `cf515e3725`,
DESIGN.md §1–2, API.md §1–3 and FENCE.md. RV67's independent original re-derivation
is preserved at `ec6e5080f8`; its backcheck at `863956b0c5` closes RV67-1, RV67-2
and RV67-3. ROOT read the full BACKCHECK, checked its five payloads and external
audit, and verified its pinned origins. The verification record preserves ROOT's
corrected origin-loop assumption; no partial pass or commit was credited.

This selects the prospective D1 process amendment for this prepared ordinary
producer: genuine new annular section primitives; unchanged native p/P, stop and
R7/A1 admission; separate fixed-precision final projection; direct certification
against both required readouts of the actual final values. D1's affected product
formation language is prospectively replaced only at the stated scope. The native
stop list is never represented as convergence evidence for those different final
values. Actual native p512 alone selects the existing floors. Original criteria,
source/material meanings, scale/class rules and observable requirements remain.
No historical design or sealed evidence is rewritten.

The selected APIs use one owner-bound pair of residual results through projection
and certification, and one frozen candidate through numeric, observable and G5a
checks. The private transfer preserves ordinary fallback before success. The
existing coefficient maximum is regenerated from actual candidate actions and
prepared section data. Local size/copy/capacity and failure-work obligations are
mandatory; they do not establish an all-in invocation debit or resource profile.

ROOT grants same TASK I51 the exact twelve-path private FENCE, with the two
narrowly conditional S11 inventory paths, through the implementation brief.
CODE is clean at `8bbc04e8a3` after ROOT's no-ff synchronization; maintained Piping
and applicable instruction bytes remain identical to the reviewed `c79a1c293d`
basis. The single guarded runtime lane is available. The first live checkpoint
must establish actual prepared new-K admission and resolution before a full
candidate overlay. A complete private success remains a dependency of the public
F2a milestone, not publication.

Public activation still requires explicit method/formation and replay/reader
integration, receipt/custody and invocation-wide charging, full resource/caller
qualification, all protected availability/coexistence checks, native Current and
the standing PR gates. This selection changes no public identity or receipt today
and creates no new source-meaning or availability exception. The existing delegated
correctness authority covers this technical formulation; no new owner-held choice
was found by the independent backcheck. Actual future public-meaning changes still
return to the owner with a reviewed concrete proposal.


## First prepared native run and explicit C0 sequencing miss (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

The prepared model now reaches native admission in both modes, but ROOT holds further runtime until the local accounting prerequisite missed before that run is closed.

I51's FIRST_NATIVE report, frozen at 10:12:54Z, records native p=128 and verification
P=256, one actual new-source native call and 58 native rows per mode. ROOT read the
report, successful command, relevant raw records and complete frozen C1_SOURCE
patch, and verified their manifested hashes (verification/i51_first_native_03).
The prepared property bits match the reviewed design and the actual source is new.
This is an observed numerical checkpoint, not independent source acceptance,
complete product-row certification, final G5a or public publication.

ROOT challenged I51's statement that helper/snapshot accounting remained to finish.
I51 then confirmed that the required callee/return-temporary live schedule and full
nested-copy/capacity ledger were incomplete before C1, despite measured principal
layouts and arithmetic-entry records. This is I51's premature run, caught by ROOT;
it is not a retrospective completion of C0. The original FIRST_NATIVE and failed
attempts remain unchanged. ROOT granted a fifteen-minute local correction box,
with further runtime held until its concrete correction is checked. No profile,
RSS or host-tool work is opened, and the component's original deadlines remain.


## Narrow late observation seam granted for C0 repair (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT grants the independently checked late observation call so I51 can remove unnecessary full model/build copies while keeping source construction behind positive custody checks.

The exact unapplied proposal is preserved at `d520aba770`. RV67's review at
`29d91fa066` verifies the five-line PP/lib.rs callsite and one-case/no-combination
coexistence argument, but leaves RV67-L1 and RV67-L2 blocking before runtime
reliance. ROOT read the complete review and verified its five payloads and four
external reconstruction/audit files. The added path is limited to that exact call;
all other lib arithmetic, routing, solver, maximum and output code remains excluded.

ROOT directs implementation of the specified corrections, followed by the same
reviewer's applied-source check: remove the transient bypass latch through a closed
inner capture helper; preserve entered work and accounting-aware comparison errors;
require successful matching solver observations before source construction; retain
final-envelope checks. This is a source repair grant, not closure of those findings
or permission for product/solver execution. It supersedes the earlier instruction
to prepare a second unapplied callback proposal; the original proposal stays intact.

I51 supplied the missing helper/return-temporary schedule and a filtered layout/
accounting check within its correction box, at 10:29:54Z. ROOT read the complete
schedule and command record. The named layout/copy owners are explicit; no stack,
RSS or all-in allowance is inferred. The broad snapshot remains unqualified and
must be removed, with actual source-child/string/vector prefixes completed.
Compilation and isolated capture/accounting controls are prospectively allowed
under the addendum, with no native or public product solve. Further solver runs
wait for the applied C0 check and confirmed closure of RV67-L1/L2. The fifteen-minute
repair-return box does not reset the component's original deadlines.


## Local C0 closed and private solver tests restored (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT restores the existing private solver/product test grant after the applied capture repair and local accounting boundary cleared the same independent reviewer.

RV67's backcheck at `8b7c1c2ce4` closes RV67-L1/L2 and identifies no remaining
concrete local C0 blocker in the supplied boundary. ROOT read it completely,
verified its five payloads and seven external files, and rechecked the three
current PP source hashes against the frozen applied boundary at `9754381f53`.
ROOT had also read the complete applied patch, helper schedule and isolated-test
records. The broad clone graph and bypass latch are removed; positive observation
custody, accounting-aware comparisons and explicit new copy/capacity prefixes
replace them. The owning backcheck states the local evidence and its limits.

I51 may now apply the staged continuation onto this corrected source and resume
only the already selected private component under the existing guard, single
runtime lane, command caps and original deadlines. Preserve the checked C0
changes and rerun affected controls as the full candidate changes. Neither this
restoration nor the earlier native success accepts the unreviewed dual-proof/
projection implementation, its resource profile or any public F2a output.

The first native run's premature-C0 chronology remains explicit. The next numerical
checkpoint is the complete actual two-mode candidate: projected raw/SI values,
full predicates, actual final G5a, observables, work/lifetimes and independent truth
comparison. ROOT's early source read also flagged the in-progress final-proof
success-token invariant and newly introduced accounting for completion during
this same component. No failed numerical verdict may yield a successful certified
state, and no private test is counted as public publication.


## Actual C2 refusal preserved; paired producer corrections selected (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT selects the independently checked K-seeded source center and support-component hypot formation together because the actual candidate exposed both conservative enclosure refusals and a separate support-norm inconsistency.

I51 sealed the implementation refusal at 11:29:13Z. ROOT read its RETURN, C4
limitations and full maintained core diff, verified fifteen payloads, seventy-three
external files, eleven changed source files and the other baseline files, and
preserved the unaccepted WIP on CODE at `430bc4f798`. It is not merged into NUM
or main, is not a passing component, and has no public publication claim. The
verification record is verification/i51_implementation_refusal_03.

RV67's review at `73383ae6d7` independently verifies all 194 actual mechanical
point predicates while confirming seven conservative Absolute certificate refusals
per mode and the separate support-norm failure. Its §1 distinguishes full width,
half-width and actual interval-distance error; that table corrects the proposal's
loose K-width wording. The first C2 command stopped before observables/G5a; the later
same-row diagnostic command checked them and still returned numerical refusal.
G5a passed there. Its exact diagnostic source was recovered afterwards, with all
ten file hashes independently matched; it was not originally archived at execution.
ROOT read the complete review and verified its seven payloads and six bulk files.

Select REVIEW §2's same-draft K midpoint initialization only for AnnularSource,
with actual owner/DOF/unit binding, exact prescribed coordinates, fixed-precision
midpoint arithmetic, at most one correction per lane and fresh source residual/
radius/recovery. The existing arbitrary-finite-center theorem supplies the warrant;
a narrower future enclosure is not assumed from the seed alone.

Select REVIEW §3's support-only formation amendment: complete the authenticated
component slots, form force/moment magnitudes with the actual two-call binary64
hypot order, and retain independent dual physical norm certification plus the
unchanged observable guard and all actual final scale/class/predicate checks.
Displacement magnitudes, stresses and coefficient maxima retain their selected
formations. Record this row-family distinction in private algorithm provenance
and later public method/reader integration. No criterion, source interpretation,
structural-zero exemption or availability exception is changed. The reviewer finds
no new owner-held public-meaning choice.

The two amendments must be tested together: moving the norm near its components
without reducing the current broad source enclosure would itself fail the norm
certificate (RV67 §1). ROOT releases one sixty-minute same-implementer continuation
under its committed brief, with a first live result by minute fifteen, new-edit
cutoff forty-five and seal/reap sixty. The earlier task has already sealed; these
are explicit new clocks, not a retrospective extension. The existing worktree,
guard, runtime caps and narrow source fence remain. Full component controls and
local accounting are still open; independent implementation review and all public
F2a obligations remain required.


## First private complete pass and fresh implementation review (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT records the first complete private candidate pass while retaining the hold on component acceptance until fresh source review and local completion are finished.

FIRST_AMENDED, frozen at 11:47:10Z, reports all 98 sparse and 99 dense verdicts,
G5a, observables and the private commit passing for the same named request. ROOT
checked the actual successful command/raw records and froze the source patch and
hashes in verification/i51_first_amended_04 at `79ebfa64ae`. Native p [Correction 2026-10-03: remains 128 bits];
this is the private path, not public F2a publication or a passed final PR gate.

Fresh TASK RV68 began full private-component review from that frozen source at
11:52:41Z, under its committed brief, with no compiler/solver lane while I51 owns
runtime. Its source assessment and later final-delta confirmation must cover the
actual final candidate. RV68's initial independent arithmetic checks confirm the
point/interval/predicate, norm, maximum/headline and G5a results, with its evidence
still in the ongoing review packet rather than a final acceptance return.

The fresh source review found re-entry could create another draft and discard
prior refusal work; it also found ordinary-envelope substitution across preparation/
projection and missing actual conversion-outcome evidence. Same I51 is repairing
those selected ownership/accounting obligations. RV68 confirmed the frozen re-entry
repair; the owning entry and conversion repair are under delta review. Concrete
remaining mask capacities, first-lane failure accounting and compact old/new section
provenance are routed to the same component. No new source meaning or tolerance is
introduced. Full private acceptance remains pending these repairs and final review.


## Failed source-view capacity prefix granted (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT grants the minimal view-work telemetry change so a source-view refusal retains capacities allocated before that refusal.

ROOT and RV68 independently inspected the actual build_source_bridge_view path:
prescribed allocation precedes prescription checks, and data allocation precedes
cache/body-bound/work checks. Recording capacity only after a successful view
loses those failed prefixes. The exact additional adaptive.rs scope is two usize
fields in SourceBridgeViewWork and actual-capacity assignments immediately after
those existing allocations, plus the already permitted into_data seam. Record
Vec<bool> capacity units faithfully; no allocation strategy or numerical/native
algorithm changes. source_residual.rs transfers that work before matching success
or error. Two existing SourceBridgeViewWork literals in source_bridge_tests.rs may
add only Default tails, retaining their injected faults and all assertions.

I51's new failed-view control stays in the already fenced source_residual_tests.rs.
It must distinguish before-allocation, after-prescribed and after-data failures,
retain original errors and zero correction, and rerun affected view/residual and
layout checks. RV68's source-only assessment has no objection to this exact scope;
actual final-diff/hash confirmation remains pending. ROOT sent the grant before
the original new-edit cutoff; it does not extend that clock or close the component.


## Passing private producer accepted and merged locally (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT accepts the independently reviewed private prepared producer because the named case now passes both physical certificates and all unchanged final publication checks in both modes.

The accepted source is `922db9dce3`, relative to accepted I50 source
`c79a1c293d`. RV68's complete-component REVIEW, sealed at 12:53:15Z and preserved
at `94dbd2dcee`, closes its re-entry, ordinary-owner substitution, conversion
evidence, failed-prefix and provenance findings. Its Independent checks section
owns the 194 mechanical point and dual-certificate predicate checks, 232 native
interval containments, and the three focused runs (28/28, 24/24 and 1/1).
Native precision remains p = 128 / P = 256 for this request; fixed 1024-bit product
proof/formation is separate. These figures describe the named private candidate,
not public availability or all possible inputs.

ROOT read the complete review and author return, had read the complete maintained
component and final eight-file delta, and verified the sealed payloads, external
manifests and all thirteen final maintained source hashes. The owning verification
records are verification/i51_completion_04 and verification/rv68_component_01.
The no-ff local merge is `458603880a`; the maintained Piping trees exactly match
the independently checked source after integration. Its merge record is
RESUME_2026-09-30/I51_PREPARED_MERGE/RECORD.md. This is the F2a integration branch,
not main, and it does not claim final PR gates.

The last authorized source edit missed its cutoff by 14.116 seconds, as RV68's
Local account and qualifications section records. ROOT accepts the reviewed bytes
while retaining that procedural departure; the cutoff is not retroactively
extended. No further source edit occurred and the final seal/reap deadline held.
The earlier premature-C0 run, failures, after-run source recovery and timing
corrections remain preserved. Future cutoff crossings must stop edits and return
the remaining item explicitly; success does not erase a process miss.

Public receipts, registered formation/source/work evidence, invocation and
combination ownership, the three readers/carriers, complete resource/caller
qualification and native Current remain open. I52's sealed reconciliation at
`897f2092e4` is preserved as a proposal; fresh RV69 is independently reviewing it.
The same I52 now realizes its exact C3 contract under the bounded brief at
`190f7ec53d`. C3 denotes the prepared-producer delta to the earlier C1/C2 public
wire proposals. No name, public contract or producer activation is selected by
those assignments. They directly advance the first public publishing milestone.


## Public formation reconciliation cleared for concrete realization (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT accepts the bounded reconciliation because independent source tracing supports preserving the existing reader checks while making the prepared producer's warrant explicit.

I52's reconciliation at `897f2092e4` is independently checked by fresh RV69,
whose REVIEW/RETURN sealed at 12:57:26Z. ROOT read both completely and verified
the seven sealed payloads and external manifest. RV69's G7/G8 section owns the
three-language source comparison: preserve the literal base validator and use
only relevant authored-fact helpers; the historical binary64 stress recipe and
exact-profile E/nu assumption do not apply to the ordinary prepared route.
This is a checked interface conclusion, not executed three-reader parity.

Carry RV69-N1 into the concrete C3 definition: D2 §4.9.10, §4.11.2 and §5 I-9
need scoped successor cross-references separating native convergence from direct
final-candidate certification. Keep all bounds, inequalities, source meaning and
later S-I timing. Historical design bytes remain unchanged. Typed lane/work/error
and preparation evidence still need actual implementation; Debug strings or
invented current facts are forbidden. The exact C3 definition, fields, names,
error mapping and maintained fence still need independent confirmation and ROOT
selection before maintained implementation.

I53 is separately dispatched for the already open native caller resource premise,
using I38's preserved source result. It must prove the actual finite callback/
request-context premise or return the precise missing term and smallest product
correction. This is a public-publication dependency, not host-tool development.
It receives no runtime, installation, source-write or policy authority. No memory
allowance, unsupported H multiplier or platform guarantee is selected.


## Public PR packaging must preserve evidence without carrying the bulk corpus (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT will prepare a compact public PR candidate because directly merging the current integration branch would carry a large inherited evidence corpus into main.

At integration head `b704de561f` against main `381be775ae`, a scoped Git path
census found 2,449 changed execution-record files whose current files total
88,494,825 bytes. This is a current-file byte sum, not patch size or compressed
Git-pack growth. Sixty-five other changed Piping files total 3,142,550 current
bytes. The count is a packaging observation, not a review finding on their
numerical validity. No new maintained diff line referenced the dated run roots
or local host paths in the bounded source scan.

Continue numerical/public integration first. Before opening the public F2a PR,
cut its candidate from current main with the exact reviewed maintained code and
only the concise records, decisive outputs, small inputs/scripts and manifests
needed for review/recovery. Preserve the complete integration branch and original
hash-bound evidence; bulk may remain in a verified archive/scratch with committed
hash, size and stable location/immutable revision references. Do not rewrite sealed
records, force-push history or prune originals. Ensure all retained references
resolve through the archive/index rather than silently breaking local links.
The final candidate needs source-equality verification, independent full-diff
review and all normal gates; prior local checks alone do not qualify the cut.

Each PR body will state its actual record file count and bytes with the reason.
This is a prospective packaging plan within the owner's direction, not a new
standing instruction or a selected repository-wide records budget. It creates
no current archive/tooling assignment and does not interrupt the publication path.


## Corrected prepared public contract selected (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT selects the corrected prepared ordinary contract so public evidence can state the actual formation, source and work without attributing the final values to the native stop list.

The selection is I52/prepared_public_contract_02 at `77bb95e4ac`, including
DEFINITION.json and C3_DELTA.md, **together with** the corrective ADDENDUM.md at
`7b4709bcec`. The uncorrected delta alone is not selected. RV69's complete C3
review and same-reviewer F1 backcheck, sealed at 13:22:16Z and preserved at
`a387fceab1`, close RV69-N1 and RV69-C3-F1. ROOT read the complete review,
proposal/definition and correction, verified their payloads and external review
manifest, and repeated collision/source-equality checks after refreshing main.
Main remains `381be775ae`; no F2a PR is open.

The registered definition is RP-PREPARED-ORDINARY-DUAL-v1, with its nested
RP-PREPARED-ANNULUS-v1 preparation. Its exact raw bytes and domain hash are in
verification/rv69_c3_selection_02/CHECKS.json and the author manifest. Reserve the
C1/C3 identities, profiles, policy names, hash domains and failure-code spellings
listed by that verification for this F2a realization. Existing kernel policy and
internal method placeholder retain their meanings. These are scoped prospective
reservations, not installed schemas/tables or public activation; final successor
and inherited table hashes still bind the actual atomic implementation.

Native p/P, stop summaries and actual-p512 floor activation remain separate from
fixed 1024-bit preparation/proof/projection. The two physical readings, row-family
formations, all final bounds/classes/predicates and literal base reader checks
remain binding. D2 §4.9.10, §4.11.2 and §5 I-9 receive the scoped prospective
warrant cross-reference in the new definition; historical bytes are untouched.
This realizes the already selected numerical guarantee and introduces no new
owner-held meaning, criterion, availability or interval-binding choice.

Old operational records bind their actual old operands, results and work; only
new successful records bind prepared C2 terms. Preserve old errors, separate
entered prefixes and the actual prelude/vector transition. The added old_coverage
stamp and typed preparation/lane/work/error/conversion seams must be implemented
at their real boundaries. Existing cardinality checks, Debug output or expected
control flow do not supply them. The full review owns the source-to-wire and
trust-boundary qualifications; no unrun cross-language parity is credited.

No maintained write grant follows from this ruling alone. I51 now owns one
coherent producer admission/ownership milestone under brief `92790ca0cc`, reusing
accepted P1/P3 and implemented private work rather than reopening numerical search.
Its concrete composition, pre-execution permits, source/failure/copy lifetimes,
receipt transaction and qualified build/caller terms precede a scoped implementation
grant. Full invocation/combination and promised exact scope, all three readers/
carriers, native Current, resource qualification and every standing PR gate remain.


## Native caller gap accepted within its actual window (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT accepts the independently checked native prerequisite result while withholding a complete native allocation claim because the included context census is still unproved.

I53 at `77bb95e4ac` and fresh RV70's review preserved at `51930cf747` identify
the exact lifetime/capacity term. ROOT read both fully and verified their sealed
payloads. The accepted window remains application-owned Rust through guarded
JSON-body transfer, including attributable prefix/carryover owners that overlap
that window. Transferred output queues, unrelated jobs and framework/TS heaps
remain excluded. Main-thread affinity and one pending JS poll do not prove the
missing bound; arbitrary raw IPC is not automatically required scope.

Continue the already selected first-party route only, through I53's bounded
profile/ownership brief at `51930cf747`. It must produce concrete source-qualified
terms or the exact external/decision prerequisite, not another generic platform
investigation. No numeric H, memory allowance, finite-use restriction, ordinary
behavior change, Wry patch or host tooling is selected. I51 keeps the native
interface explicitly unqualified while completing the producer composition.


## Corrected caller interface accepted; first publication stays the next milestone (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT accepts the corrected conditional caller interface so producer accounting preserves resident ownership without turning a reply boundary into a false release.

The accepted input is I53 first_party_profile_02 at `6d9ec9092c` together with
correction_03 at `d85300e1d7`. RV70's complete continuation review and same-reviewer
backcheck sealed at 13:36:28Z close P2 RV70-P02-1. ROOT read both, read the full
author addendum, and verified every sealed payload. The owning record is
verification/rv70_profile_02. Logical call/envelope facts retain their explicit
units and source limits in the review; they are not native population measurements.

Upstream producer/resident ownership U includes the stored result and lease until
actual last-owner Drop. Compose it with the separate caller allocation account only
at actual overlap; do not add the resident result twice or release it at final
poll, registration or UI detachment. Original request/context, ordinary response
and W1 response allocations have distinct owners. Reservations bind actual native
invocations/jobs, not an assumed one worker per logical UI start.

The finite included native-context/tail and attributable backing premise remains
unproved, along with its capacity/build/emergency qualifications. No H, byte
allowance, global IPC/RSS guarantee, finite-use restriction, ordinary behavior
change or source patch is accepted. This bounded source investigation is concluded
at its stated limit; no further vendor/host-tool work is assigned. Native activation
still needs the explicit qualification. I51 may use the corrected conditional
interface while deriving producer and direct/headless terms.

I51's next admission checkpoint is deliberately the first generic eligible captured
ordinary single-case publication, in both modes, through the real producer/receipt
transaction. It is not a fixture-ID special case, full F2a C0 or a main merge. Keep
typed ordinary handling, whole-invocation exact-block bypass, untouched fallback
and protected controls. The current ninety-minute clock and no-code grant remain.
ROOT sent this narrower milestone before the initial interface deadline.

The source comparison also identified a later mandatory extension: selected
prepared geometry changes stiffness, while ordinary combination operands may not
be numerically solved on demand. C3's case-only attempt requires a selected native
Run and cannot represent that preparation-only operand capability. Preserve this
concrete gap for the full F2a package; do not invent hidden solves, fake readiness
or an availability exception, and do not branch this checkpoint into combination
design. Promised exact and source-compatible combination routes, resource/caller
qualification, all three readers/carriers, native Current and full PR gates remain
mandatory before the complete F2a main merge.


## Conditional admission design accepted; caller and census code checkpoint released (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT accepts the reviewed admission architecture and releases its narrow first code checkpoint because caller separation and trustworthy count facts are prerequisites to an honest public admission decision.

The selected design is I51/public_producer_admission_05 at `8a7ae33ec0`.
Fresh RV71's sealed review at `19d00f9a53` closes RV71-1 and confirms the early
ordinary overlap, terminal adapter freeze, existing canonical path, headless copy
account and failure/count distinctions. ROOT read the complete design and review,
verified their seals and the author's nine payloads, thirteen external files and
thirty-seven origins. The roughly seventy-second initial checkpoint delay remains
recorded; later checkpoints/seals held and no clock was reset.

This accepts a conditional architecture, not a computable production profile,
full F2a C0, numeric M or permission to execute public W1. Existing shared Value,
typed and headless wrappers stay ordinary/W1-disabled. Separate explicit direct
and headless entries prevent unchanged native callers from inheriting the shorter
direct window. The first code grant is exactly BRIEFS/I51_ADMISSION_IMPLEMENTATION_A:
six maintained paths for that barrier, nonallocating borrowed census, explicit
unknown/denial/profile boundaries and meaningful ordinary-preservation controls.
No new canonical writer, reader/table/schema installation, kernel change, native
edit or host tooling is included. Missing qualification must remain missing.

ROOT synchronized CODE with NUM by no-ff merge `90aae4e6e7`; all maintained Piping
bytes still match `922db9dce3`, and CODE is clean. The existing M5 guard is active
and no Cargo/rustc process was running at release. I51 alone receives the bounded
focused-test lane in the brief. Fresh implementation review and ROOT full-diff
verification precede local fan-in. Source/build-bound numeric profile completion
and M selection remain necessary before the first actual public execution; this
checkpoint cannot be presented as that publishing milestone.


## Caller/census checkpoint accepted and merged locally (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT accepts the caller/census boundary because it prevents unqualified native access and exposes real count/capacity facts without changing ordinary results.

Source `24af17c470` is independently reviewed by fresh RV72, whose sealed review
is preserved at `0022d734f0`. The owning REVIEW records independent product
integration 5/5, inline census/admission 5/5 and headless 3/3 checks, with stable
source and full reap; the author's unchanged private regression 28/28 evidence
was hash-verified rather than rerun by the reviewer. ROOT read the complete
six-file patch and both returns, verified all payloads/bulk and the exact source
write set, and matched the committed source blobs to the tested hashes.

The no-ff local integration is `a9c2256076`; maintained Piping trees exactly
match CODE after the merge. I51_ADMISSION_A_MERGE/RECORD.md, this ruling and the
graph/current-state update form the same closeout pass. The initial test's wrong
pressure-receipt assumption remains preserved; actual pressure bytes and the
separate positive N05 source-recovery witness are checked. No numerical criterion
or protected test changed.

Explicit retained direct/headless entries now return ordinary output and non-wire
facts. Existing shared/native/typed/headless routes remain ordinary. The bounded
nonrecursive census distinguishes capacities from lengths and partial observation
from completion. Every production profile/M remains absent; no capture permit can
be constructed and no public W1 execution is enabled. This is necessary code for
the first publishing milestone, not that milestone or full resource qualification.

I54's concurrent source-only coefficient task now targets the concrete remaining
container laws. Installed Rust source HTML and exact cached dependency/binary
provenance are available; no new tool or installation is commissioned. I54 itself
reported a misresolved scratch anchor. ROOT supplied the exact .claude/t3 path,
required verified copies with originals retained, and kept the clock unchanged.
Its final packet must disclose that placement correction. Neither a promising
table nor a per-artifact layout observation is accepted before independent review.
No further native/vendor investigation or new serializer is part of this work.


## Reviewed container laws accepted; truthful trace and ordinary overlap are next (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT accepts the reviewed container laws as partial source proofs because a defensible memory admission decision needs concrete allocation terms.

I54's packet at `f3f6fd1f2e` is independently reviewed by fresh RV73, whose
MANIFEST seal is `2f7bd352f7`. ROOT read the complete review and verified its
payload and external evidence hashes/sizes; verification/rv73_direct_container_01
owns that check. RV73's REVIEW owns the detailed numeric bounds and provenance
qualifications. The hashbrown source correspondence is accepted as its stated
inference. Private layouts remain observations of one artifact until final consumer
correspondence is established. No complete profile, M, stack/error composition
or public execution is accepted. The scratch-anchor correction, preserved original
copies and reviewer clock-label correction remain disclosed in the sealed records.

Continue with two bounded, coherent milestones: I51 implements truthful typed
preparation/proof/operational evidence, including actual failed prefixes, for the
selected corrected C3 contract; I54 binds ordinary-active/suffix memory phases
that must be included before capture. The exact scopes and clocks are in
BRIEFS/I51_PREPARED_TRACE.md and BRIEFS/I54_DIRECT_ORDINARY_BOUND.md. I51 alone has
the focused Cargo lane; I54 reads immutable source. No production profile or
public W1 activation follows. Neither task may build host tooling or broaden into
native framework investigation. Fresh complete-source review precedes code fan-in.

The named private numerical case already passes; the next work closes evidence
and admission dependencies of its first public publication. Receipts/readers,
actual profile/build/allowance qualification, full invocation/combination/exact
scope, native Current and every standing PR gate remain. Records stay compact,
bulk evidence stays external, and the public PR will be cut separately from main
under the existing packaging ruling. This is no main merge or completion claim.


## Standalone readers released within the selected public contract (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT releases the shared reader implementation because the first public result needs complete independent validation of its receipt and source associations.

I52's sealed reader_integration_04 scope, seal `7c858ac1f0`, is an implementation
boundary for the already selected corrected C3 contract, not a new public meaning
or numerical amendment. ROOT read its full RETURN, verified payload/origin hashes,
and checked current small_row_bound source and the double-rounding discriminator.
The author's early sequential-rounding wording was corrected before code: the
outer three-term sum is exact with one final upward rounding. Full source review
and independent oracle controls must cover the finite helper implementation.

BRIEFS/I52_READER_IMPLEMENTATION.md grants exactly its sixteen standalone reader,
schema and shared-control paths. Later carrier/UI/native/standing paths are held
until complete validator parity. ROOT created the isolated READER worktree at
`a8bec61e8c` on codex/piping-f2a-readers-20261003; maintained source equals
`24af17c470`. This component branch feeds NUM through reviewed local integration
only. Synthetic controls are no producer/publication evidence.

I51 retains the sole Cargo lane until explicit handoff. Existing CLI/WASM product
builds are permitted afterward for source-bound validation; no new host tooling,
dependency installation or replacement numerical authority is commissioned. The
parent npm manifests/lock match the candidate; the installed pinned WASM toolchain
and existing Python environment are available. Real tool blockers return to ROOT.
Public W1, profile/M selection and full F2a/main acceptance remain held.



## Preparation trace integer inventory extended narrowly (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT permits one explicit S11 integer-site entry because the trace now retains a bounded conversion prefix and the scanner correctly detected its new increment.

I51's unchanged cargo_04 test identifies only the round-function integer site;
the scanner controls still pass. ROOT read the actual source, inventory and raw
failed result. BRIEFS/I51_PREPARED_TRACE_S11_ADDENDUM.md opens only the one-row
inventory update, preserving all prior scans/assertions. The new capacity guard
must precede the entered-conversion count, with a full-buffer refusal control.
This is no numerical exemption or protected-criterion relaxation. The original
clock remains and independent full-diff review must cover the new source and row.


## Prepared receipt wire completions selected after independent correction review (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT selects three wire completions so the public receipt can preserve actual failures and row provenance with one unambiguous validation order.

The selected basis is I52 reader_contract_seams_06 at `c5890453d7`, together
with correction_07 at `a82b89774f` and G4 clarification_08 at `55e6722a40`.
RV69's complete independent review and same-reviewer backchecks, seal
`3e168ab329` at 16:34:04Z, close selection-blocking RS-F1. ROOT read all three
addenda and the full review, checked the actual row/source/error interfaces, and
verified every sealed review payload and external file. The owning verification
is verification/rv69_reader_seams_03. Original proposals and seals stay unchanged.

An outer prepared_product_failure cause refers to the same case's actual
unavailable ProductAttempt and its exact error, stage and Run. It invents no
SourceError or Run. A private Ready followed by receipt failure stays Ready and
uses the existing receipt/ordinary-fallback route. The scalar row method path
is results[i].recovery_method. G1 enforces the optional direct string and closed
row/metadata shape; G4 checks diagnostics; G6 enforces token presence/value/owner
scope. G7 removes only that direct member after G6 binds it. Both valid and
compound-defect controls must follow the reviewed first-failure matrix. Finally,
quantity_kind replaces only the colliding numeric payload in the two G5a errors.

These are faithful prospective wire completions within delegated technical
authority. The independent review identifies no new owner-held numerical meaning,
criterion, availability, standing or interval-binding choice. The selected
numerical definition and hash remain unchanged. I52 may implement these mappings
inside its existing sixteen-file grant and original clock. Full reader-source
review/parity, real producer transaction, profile/M/caller/native qualification
and every standing PR gate remain open; no synthetic fixture proves execution.


## Prior capture cause must survive the typed preparation refusal (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT requires the original capture failure to survive because a truthful failed prefix must not replace its actual cause with a generic custody message.

Fresh RV74 found RV74-F1 in the new trace component at `7018513af3`. The
replacement behavior is inherited, but it conflicts with this milestone's
explicit cause-preservation requirement. ROOT read the guard, overwrite and
projection and classifies it SHOULD-FIX before fan-in. Original-candidate
confirmations passed; those passes do not repair or close this finding.

BRIEFS/I51_TRACE_PRIOR_CAUSE_REPAIR.md grants only the two PP implementation/test
paths, one justified additional PP check and compact repair evidence. Preserve
prior cause before a sticky adapter fault or generic new prelude error can
overwrite it, while retaining actual fault/work and ordinary bytes. Original
source/seal deadlines remain. RV74 released its fully reaped runtime batch; I51
now owns the lane for this repair. Same-reviewer delta confirmation is required.


## Typed prepared trace accepted and merged locally (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT accepts the typed evidence component because its actual successes and refusal prefixes now survive without losing their original causes.

Final source `fc23cff95f` is independently CLEAR after RV74-F1 repair and
same-reviewer confirmation. The complete RV74 REVIEW owns the validation figures,
source scopes and explicit limits. ROOT read the full original core diff/new
module and every repair line, both author RETURNs and the full review; all sealed
payload/bulk hashes, exact patch reconstructions and committed source pins verify.

The no-ff local integration is `b56b905251`. Maintained core bytes equal
the component after merge. I51_PREPARED_TRACE_MERGE/RECORD.md, this ruling and the
current/graph update close the same integration pass. The earlier generic-cause
overwrite and S11 failure remain preserved; passing old checks did not close F1.

This closes truthful private typed capture, not the public receipt transaction
or memory admission. Native-stage failures with no recorded Run retain their
actual capture/origin cause; they do not manufacture a wire Run. Layouts remain
per-artifact observations and the snapshot is explicitly private. All production
permits remain absent. Full public producer/readers, ordinary/resource/caller
qualification, combination/exact scope, native Current and main gates remain.


## Reader implementation divided at coherent language boundaries (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT reallocates the standalone readers because three complete validators exceeded the original single-implementer window.

I52 reported the risk before its working checkpoint: schema/Python drafts existed,
but Rust/TypeScript had only finite helpers and refusing stubs, and the complete
shared receipt control was absent. ROOT owns that oversized allocation. The
original checkpoint remains partial; no helper pass is credited as a validator.

The exact sixteen-file scope is unchanged: I52 retains nine shared fixture/schema/
Python paths, I55 owns four Rust paths, and I56 owns three TypeScript paths.
LANGUAGE_HANDOFF at 17:15:47Z freezes the seven language paths. ROOT read every
new helper/test line and module delta, verified all seven hashes, and preserved
recoverable bytes in external scratch with a committed manifest. This preserves
unaccepted work; it supplies no complete-reader or independent arithmetic claim.

The new language tasks have disjoint writes in READER and bounded clocks. I52's
original clock remains. Only I52 owns shared inputs and publishes their final
frozen hashes; joint parity and fresh complete-source review remain mandatory.
I55 owns Cargo; ordinary Python/Vitest controls use the already source-bound
authorities/assets. No gate, tolerance, public meaning, coverage obligation or
future carrier/main gate is relaxed. No additional host tooling is assigned.


## Usage interruption recovered without accepting unfinished work (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT resumes the existing publication work because the owner has authorized continuation after the usage-limit interruption.

The M5 host and guard are available; no compiler/solver jobs remain. Fetched
main is still `381be775ae`. The typed evidence component remains accepted at
local merge `b56b905251`; no reader or ordinary-bound correction is accepted.
All prior live TASKs ended with usage-limit errors and are absent from the current
agent tree. ROOT preserved the exact reader WIP and interrupted records externally
with a committed hash index, and verified/preserved I54's sealed correction.

BRIEFS/USAGE_RECOVERY_2026-10-03.md assigns new, explicitly bounded recovery
executors: I57 coverage proposal, I58 shared/Python, I59 Rust, I60 TypeScript and
fresh RV75 ordinary-bound review. Old deadlines and partial checkpoints are
retained rather than reset retrospectively. The coverage gap and synthetic native
digest placeholders are explicit. Unknown coverage cannot become an eligibility
pass. Complete review/parity and all public/resource/native/main holds remain.


## Corrected ordinary-memory source terms accepted at their partial scope (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT accepts the corrected ordinary-memory formulas because fresh independent review has verified the combined source derivation and its explicit limits.

The accepted basis is I54 ordinary_bound_02 at `71615e34b8` together with
correction_03 at `e21e248f42`. Fresh RV75's complete combined review sealed
at 19:16:02Z independently confirms all four corrections and the unaffected
claim scope. This is not a claim that interrupted RV73 completed its backcheck.
ROOT read the entire original/corrected derivation and full REVIEW, and verified
its sealed payload/external hashes. verification/rv75_ordinary_bound owns those
checks; RV75 REVIEW owns the arithmetic counts and numerical component values.

The correction must accompany every use of the original. Stable source sorting,
Expansion temporary/reallocation ownership, ordinary stress/status helpers and
formation-guard bodies/maps are now included within the stated source families.
This does not supply a complete ordinary or DirectPp total, M or fit. Final build/
layout association, nested input capacities/construction, H_formation128, complete
text grammar, generic deep legacy-exact, stack and whole producer/publication/
caller composition remain genuine gaps. No further closure task is started here
because the owner requested a graceful handoff.


## Summary-coverage representation selected for the successor (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT selects the compact proof-owned coverage representation because public rows cannot determine the private verification facts required by exact summary coverage.

The selected design is I57 ADDENDUM at `11d6dbb6c1`, seal `aa066abea6`.
Fresh RV76 independently derived the source algebra before reading the proposal,
then reviewed the full contract, custody, prefix/null, gate and trust implications.
Its seal `6d5e385e08` at 19:18:02Z reports CLEAR with no unresolved finding.
ROOT read the entire proposal/review and verified sealed payload/source hashes;
verification/rv76_summary_coverage owns that check. The review owns its Boolean
check counts and exact derivation. No new owner-held meaning change is found
within the existing producer-attestation/source-review/Rust-replay boundary.

C3 ProofTrace gains one nullable complete body roster of body, stop[4] and
has_data, sourced from the proof owner, never the fallible adapter copy. Public
layout/E/extent/floor facts derive estimate and charge, including native p512
force/moment charge equal to its stop flags. The receipt hash binds the outcome;
source/preparation identity and the numerical definition retain their meanings.
All source/Run/owner, null/prefix, exact roster and consistency rules in I57 are
required. Unkeyed hashes do not authenticate a coherently forged whole attestation.

This is design selection only. At the owner's graceful-handoff request, no
typed-trace/schema/reader/corpus implementation follows in this run. Readers
remain disabled/ineligible, and the successor must implement and independently
verify the full selected rules and actual producer custody before reliance.
Full F2a, memory/M, caller/native, carrier and main gates remain open.


## Graceful handoff: frozen partial readers and no active work (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

ROOT stops at the owner's handoff request, preserving the reviewed decisions and exact unfinished reader code without treating it as accepted.

The current reviews finished: ordinary source terms are accepted only with their
correction and full-profile qualifications; summary-coverage design is selected
for the successor, not implemented. The three reader authors froze at their
current useful checkpoints and released all runtime. Their RETURNs own the
actual test counts, failures, source scopes and missing gate obligations. ROOT
read all returns and verified sealed payloads, bulk, source/snapshot hashes and
the exact sixteen-path fence. No full reader-core review or source acceptance
is claimed. The thirteen changed reader files remain uncommitted in READER.

HANDOFF_2026-10-03/READER_STATE.json records the recoverable external archive,
verified by a full readback, and the complete source/packet identities. Compact
sealed author records are preserved verbatim on NUM; bulk remains external. No
source is pruned, force-pushed or merged into main. The final handoff, short
ROOT_CURRENT and graph distinguish accepted work, selected design and unaccepted
WIP. No new TASK/slice/PR was started after the graceful-close instruction.

The successor follows the owner's start direction. Actual summary capture, full
reader branch controls/review/parity, admission/profile/M, public transaction,
wider exact/combination/caller/native scope and all main gates remain. T3 is
not complete and the passing private case is not a public F2a publication.

## Resumption by the next ROOT; coverage implementation planned (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

The owner started this ROOT through the development-loop init prompt, with `HANDOFF_2026-10-03_TO_NEXT_ROOT.md` as the run's steering. ROOT verified the handed-over state before any new work, and plans the selected summary-coverage implementation as the next bounded step.

**Verified at resumption:**
- **Host:** the M5 Max (128 GiB). The existing memory guard is running as PID 5387. No cargo, rustc, pytest or vitest process is running.
- **Git:** main is still `381be775ae`, and no F2a PR is open.
  - NUM is clean at `b4a31da406` and matches its remote.
  - CODE is clean at `652ad0cc1f`. It is fully contained in NUM.
  - READER is at `a8bec61e8c`, branched from NUM before the typed-evidence merge, so NUM is 33 commits ahead of it.
- **The reader drafts:**
  - all 16 owned source hashes in `HANDOFF_2026-10-03/READER_STATE.json` match the files in READER, and so does the archive's sha256;
  - every other uncommitted path in READER is either an author record packet or the ROOT-owned `node_modules` link. No stray source.
  - 33 of the packet files are byte-identical to NUM's copies.
  - The other four (I52's two files, and I55's and I56's receipts) exist only in scratch. Their hashes are committed in `RESUME_2026-10-03_1904/INTERRUPTED_RECORDS.json`, and they match.
- **The design anchors:** NUM's maintained core source is unchanged since `fc23cff95f`, the basis of I57's selected coverage design, so its file:line references hold.

**Plan for resume step 2 (the selected coverage design, I57 ADDENDUM at `11d6dbb6c1`):**
- **First, an unaccepted WIP commit.** ROOT commits READER's 13 changed reader paths as a single commit on the local READER branch, labelled unaccepted WIP. Their bytes are the archive's. This gives the next authors and reviewers a diffable base. It is not a fan-in, an acceptance or a main candidate. Author record packets stay on NUM and are not staged on READER.
- **Wave 1 runs two disjoint grants in parallel:**
  - **I61, the producer's typed seam.** On a new branch from NUM `b4a31da406`, I61 carries the proof-owned coverage vector through `ProductProofTrace` and the private C3 projection. It applies the null/complete rules and the nine-flag reconstruction cross-check, with producer-side custody and partial-failure controls. No serializer, public receipt or JSON encoding exists yet, and none is added: that belongs to the receipt transaction (resume step 4).
  - **I62, the shared schema and Python reader.** In READER, I62 adds the closed `summary_coverage` member to the schema, adds the I57 §5 controls to the shared synthetic corpus, and implements the Python reader's G1, G2, G3, G5 and G5a coverage checks. It then publishes a frozen shared snapshot 04.
- **Wave 2,** after snapshot 04 is verified: the Rust reader (I63) and the TypeScript reader (I64) implement the same checks against it, on disjoint paths.
- **Scope of every grant:** coverage only. Each reader's remaining audit and failure-prefix controls (resume step 3) follow under a separate grant. A fresh independent review covers each component before ROOT accepts it.
- **Unchanged:**
  - reader eligibility stays closed, and no public activation, M or permit follows;
  - no new host tooling;
  - the next free IDs after this wave are I65 and RV77.

## I62 checkpoint A: snapshot 04 accepted for reader coverage work (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

I62 froze the shared coverage contract as snapshot 04 in about 19 minutes. ROOT verified it and releases all three readers on it. The coverage controls it cannot yet express go into a snapshot 05, which every reader must pass before acceptance.

**Verified by ROOT:**
- **Changes:** only the two expected shared files changed in READER:
  - the receipt schema `f943ebd351` (was `5652929173`);
  - the corpus `8e333e632c` (was `67d5cbcc00`).
- **The record folder:** RETURN, SHARED_SNAPSHOT_04 (`cb7aa0bbd7`) and its SHA256SUMS verify.
- **The two complete cases** differ from snapshot 03 only by the added `summary_coverage` and their `receipt_sha256`. That matches I57 §5: the receipt hash binds the field, and the source, preparation and publication hashes don't move.
- **The 30 snapshot-03 mutations** are byte-identical.
- **The new content:** 47 mutations, plus one synthetic no-data positive case.
- **ROOT's own run** of the two Python test files: 86 passed and 14 failed. The 14 are exactly the checks checkpoint B implements.

**Rulings:**
- **Both of I62's deviations are accepted:**
  - the 2^53 body-id control is dropped, because the checked canonical JSON refuses unsafe integers before any gate;
  - the ordering control `certified_bound_unbound_drop_existing_g5` is added.
- **I62 was right to discard its p512 prototype.** The native ladder always starts at p128, so a corpus case must be one the native solver can produce.
- **The readers are released now.** I62 continues to checkpoint B (the Python checks). I63 (Rust) and I64 (TypeScript) start on snapshot 04 under `BRIEFS/I63_I64_COVERAGE_READERS.md`. I63's Cargo may run beside I61's, on separate targets.
- **Snapshot 05 follows as I62's checkpoint C,** after checkpoint B. It adds faithful synthetic base cases for the §5 controls snapshot 04 cannot express:
  - multi-body swaps;
  - an absent kind and zero extent;
  - native p512 reached through the p128 → p256 → p512 ladder, with zero and positive floors;
  - a second owner or proof;
  - failed-prefix, unavailable and failed-certificate attempts;
  - the positive cancelling ±x loads control.
  
  The failure-prefix and unavailable bases also serve the readers' remaining audit (resume step 3), so they are built once.
- **Acceptance:** no reader's coverage implementation is accepted until it passes snapshot 05 and a fresh independent review. Eligibility stays closed.

## I62 checkpoint B verified; snapshot 05 is planned before it is built (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

The Python reader now enforces the selected coverage rules against snapshot 04, and ROOT has checked the logic against the native code. Snapshot 05 is planned first and built only after the Rust and TypeScript readers freeze on snapshot 04.

**Verified by ROOT:**
- **ROOT's run:** 107 passed and 0 failed.
- **Changes:** only `retained_precision.py` (`94330e168f`) and its Python-only test file (`de1c401503`) changed. The shared schema and corpus are still at snapshot 04, and the public API stays disabled.
- **The core diff, read by ROOT:**
  - **G3** compares the coverage roster with the attempt's source inventory.
  - **G5** applies the §3 stage and binding rules.
  - **G5a** runs the feasibility rule, the estimate and charge rederivation, the exact rosters and the direct data facts. It no longer uses the Cartesian roster.
  - Checked against `final_case.rs:1371–1448`, the floor positivity is ORed after the extent coupling and outside it, as the Python does. Native p512 charge is `present ∧ positive`, which equals the force/moment stop flags in this scope, as I57 §2 derives.

**This is source-level verification, not acceptance.** Python's coverage work is accepted only together with the other readers, after snapshot 05 and a fresh independent review.

**The coverage-before-WORK order is I57's:** association first, then the original WORK pass. Snapshot 05 adds a coverage-plus-WORK dual-defect mutation so all three readers are held to it.

**Checkpoint C is split:**
- **C0** is a plan, with no shared-file edits while I63 and I64 test against snapshot 04. For each new base case it gives the native code path, with file:line, that makes the case one the solver can actually produce, and its expected outcome in each reader. The cases are:
  - multiple bodies with distinguishable constraints;
  - an absent kind;
  - zero extent;
  - native p512 through the p128 → p256 → p512 ladder, with zero and positive floors;
  - a second owner or proof;
  - the §3 failure rows (no proof; a lane failure; a certificate failing before the summary; a summary followed by a certificate failure; a partial adapter copy);
  - unavailable and failed-certificate attempts;
  - the positive cancelling ±x loads case.
  
  C0 also covers I59's and I58's shared failure-prefix controls (pre-helper, captured_prefix, unequal prefixes, K-only and Source-failed, old-Err/new-Ready, source construction failure, post-native unavailable, maxima-abandon). It promotes I62's three layout controls to shared mutations, and covers the Python G5a direct checks for unavailable attempts that keep complete coverage.
- **C1** builds snapshot 05 after ROOT accepts the plan and I63 and I64 have frozen.

## I61 producer seam committed for review; F1a regression found; I64 TypeScript coverage verified (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**I61, the producer's typed coverage seam.** I61 changed four files (+496 −3):
- `final_case.rs` gains a borrowed coverage view in `ProductProofTrace`, `rederive_coverage` and `check_summary_coverage`;
- `retained_receipt.rs` gains the null/complete projection;
- two test files.

ROOT verified the hashes against I61's RETURN and committed the work on its own branch as `c618675e84`. **It is unaccepted until independent review.**
- **I61's results:**
  - frame_kernel `--lib`: 477 passed, 1 ignored;
  - `s11_site_table`: 3 passed;
  - all six mutants killed.
  - Actual producer runs cover Ready at p128, a zero body, cancelled ±x loads, no proof, lane, proof-start and abandonment failures, a certificate failure after the summary, and a partial adapter copy.
  - Native p512 with a positive floor exists only at frame_kernel level, and the p512 charge mutant is killed only by a synthetic test.
- **I61's decision points, ruled:**
  - the placement in frame_kernel is accepted;
  - the error mapping onto existing `TraceProjectionError` variants is accepted;
  - proof-to-owner binding is accepted as the producer-custody limit I57 §5 states. The reviewer must confirm that the only caller passes the proof's own owner. A structural binding is reconsidered with the receipt transaction.

**A regression on the integration branch.** product_physics `--lib` fails seven tests at CODE `652ad0cc1f`, before I61's change. One is the known Mac platform test `s11g t13`, which also fails on main. The other six are F1a tests, and they are a regression of the integration branch:
- **The cause:** commit `8104a4fedd` (I50's component) changed `tests/formation_check_runtime.rs` so the `RF_SKEW_T_CANT_OFF_122_R1E_04` constant uses `include_str!` of a fixture instead of an inline literal. `src/f1a_tests.rs::p1_request` parses that file's text for the literal, so it panics.
- **The fixture's bytes equal the old literal,** so no behaviour changed.
- **Why it went unseen:** the component reviews ran focused tests, not the crate's full suite.
- **The repair (granted to I61, its own commit):** restore that test file to main's exact bytes. The fixture stays for its four other users.
- **The lesson:** local fan-ins run the full affected crate suites, not only focused ones.

**I64, TypeScript coverage checks, verified.** Its two files are at `a21487a4e1` and `9f98268ef2`. ROOT's own runs: 107 vitest tests pass and `tsc` exits 0. The shared files are still at snapshot 04, the records verify, and `SUMMARY_COVERAGE_COMPLETE` stays false. The rulings on I64's questions:
1. **Checks for unavailable attempts with a complete roster.** These are currently implemented in TypeScript, deferred in Python and untested. The rule is fixed by I62's snapshot-05 plan (C0), with expected outcomes, and all three readers align to it at C1. TypeScript's version stays provisionally and is flagged untested.
2. **The verification-record bound rule.** Shared rule: `verification.bound` lists every body exactly once, in order, and an entry is non-null if and only if `has_data`. That is Python's form, and it follows I57 §4 item 4 and the native record's one entry per body. TypeScript aligns in its next grant, and snapshot 05 pins it with a duplicate-entry mutation.
3. **The extra G1/G2 guards in TypeScript** are accepted as defence in depth. The reviewer confirms they cannot change any first-failure order.

This is source-level verification only. Reader acceptance still waits for snapshot 05 and an independent review.

## Snapshot-05 plan approved in two parts; reader parity rules; F1a repair committed (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**The F1a repair.** It is committed on the coverage branch as `e0fc33b4f7`, after I61's coverage commit `c618675e84`, and the branch is pushed.
- `tests/formation_check_runtime.rs` is byte-identical to main again.
- product_physics `--lib` now fails only the known Mac test `s11g t13` (455 passed); `retained_precision_admission` 5 passed; `formation_check_runtime` 5 passed.
- RV77 is reviewing `c618675e84` and will confirm this repair too.

**I63, the Rust coverage checks, verified.**
- `retained_precision.rs` is at `ba8a08b590` and its test file at `3b9e6f9029`; `lib.rs` is unchanged.
- ROOT's own run: 11 passed. All 77 corpus mutations match, and eligibility stays held.

**Reader parity rules** (all three readers; snapshot 05 pins each with shared mutations):
1. **G5a rebuilds the full canonical layout from the source maps and requires equality.** This is I63's literal reading of I57 §2. A relabelled, dropped, reordered or foreign-body layout row fails at G5a with SCALE_MISMATCH in every reader.
2. **A non-null empty coverage roster fails G3,** because I57 §1 has no empty complete vector.
3. **The verification-record bound rule** is the one already ruled: one entry per body, in order, non-null if and only if `has_data`.

**I62's snapshot-05 plan (`SNAPSHOT_05_PLAN.md`) is approved, in two parts:**
- **C1a, first:**
  - the six promotions, plus mutations pinning the three parity rules above;
  - the cancelled ±x loads base, which is natively witnessed;
  - the unavailable/failure-row template, with the complete-coverage and lane-failure rows;
  - the failure-prefix bases (PP:3141–3249);
  - the Python G5a direct checks for unavailable attempts, with Python aligned to the parity rules.
- **C1b, after C1a is verified:** two bodies, two load cases, and the p512 ladder.

**Scope decisions:**
- **Absent kind** is dropped as not natively producible, and replaced by "kind present with no non-input row", as I62 proposes.
- **L = 0** is built only if C1 confirms that the preview producer admits a node no member references. Otherwise it is deferred and recorded.
- **Defensive-only rows** (a certificate failing before the summary; unequal helper/new prefixes) are built with the resource/accounting-fault trigger, labelled synthetic.
- **The "must pass" undetectable variants** are shared corpus entries, so all three readers run them.
- **Floor and ladder checks: no invented contract.**
  - The p128 ladder start is enforced only where the existing selected contract (C1/C3 with 06/07/08) already requires it, at that contract's gate.
  - The floor equality Φ = `phi_512(ê)` likewise. I57 adds no floor formula.
  - If the contract does not already require one of these, readers keep consuming it as attested, and it is recorded as a candidate contract amendment for ROOT to route. C1a reports the contract citations.

## Snapshot 05a verified; floor and ladder are existing contract (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**Snapshot 05a is verified.** It is committed on READER as `bd3dc16a1d`, together with the snapshot-04 schema and the Python checks. [Correction (ROOT, 2026-10-03): the READER commit is `ccdfd04fd7`. ROOT wrote `bd3dc16a1d` before the commit existed; that hash names nothing.]

**Verified by ROOT:**
- **The new hashes:** corpus `159ef78c47`, `retained_precision.py` `27fc1797c2`, test file `7eab5b3793`. The schema is unchanged since snapshot 04.
- **Snapshot 04's three cases and 77 mutations** are byte-identical inside 05a.
- **05a adds:**
  - three synthetic cases: cancelled ±x loads, and two unavailable templates (F: adapter copy refused after a passed certificate; P: preparation refused);
  - 27 mutations, including the parity-rule pins;
  - a new `must_pass` array of 15 entries.
- **ROOT's own Python run:** 146 passed. The records (SHARED_SNAPSHOT_05A `fed637869f`, RETURN_C1A, SHA256SUMS_C1A) verify, with no machine paths.

**Contract readings, checked by ROOT against C1 `WIRE_CONTRACT.md`:**
- **The p512 floor equality** Φ = `phi_512(e_hat(E, L))` is existing contract. C1's G5b row explicitly requires "same E/ê/Φ at p512" with exact scale bits, failing as SCALE_MISMATCH. All readers implement it at G5b. Its shared mutation waits for C1b's p512 base.
- **The p128 ladder start** is existing contract, not an amendment. C1's G5 row requires the actual native schedule. C1 §1 item 5 allows skipped precisions only through recorded failed solves, and the native ladder always opens at p128 (`adaptive.rs:4519–4521`). G5 fails a schedule that doesn't open there, with ATTEMPT_MISMATCH. Rust already does this; TypeScript aligns.

**Deferrals:**
- **The source-construction failure base is deferred** until a natural trigger exists. It is not a row that only defensive checks reach, so a synthetic trigger would assert a path that may not exist.
- **Post-native unavailable (the Ceiling case) and the flag-swap must-pass entries** move to C1b, which builds the reuse chain and the second body or proof.
- **L = 0 is deferred.** The preview producer appears to admit a memberless node (`PP lib.rs:6549–6640`), but that is not confirmed end to end. The feasibility rule's L = 0 branch stays covered only by each reader's own tests until a producer run confirms the case.

**Next:**
- I63 and I64 align to 05a: the G5b Φ check, the unavailable-attempt G5a checks, the p128 ladder start for TypeScript, and a loop over `must_pass`.
- C1b (two bodies, two load cases, the p512 ladder with the Ceiling) starts after they freeze, so the shared files don't move under them.

## RV77's review of the producer coverage seam: PASS; the missing tests are added before acceptance (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

RV77 reviewed I61's `c618675e84` from its own clean archive (`REVIEW_RV77/coverage_producer_01/REVIEW.md`, sha256 `def7a1bca3`): **PASS**, with 0 BLOCKING, 1 SHOULD-FIX and 4 NOTEs.
- **Custody, the stage rules and the no-new-computation rule** all hold against the I57 §3 seams.
- **`rederive_coverage` is bit-for-bit equal to native `summary_coverage_data`,** by RV77's own derivation and an enumeration: 589,824 genuine cases with 0 refusals and 0 mismatches. I61's extra refusals never refuse a genuine vector.
- **The only production caller passes the Selected owner,** and no reachable path pairs a proof with a foreign owner.
- **The candidate adds no failure.** frame_kernel `--lib`: 477 passed. product_physics: the same seven pre-existing failures at base and candidate, plus I61's four new tests passing.
- **The F1a repair `e0fc33b4f7` is confirmed:** six f1a tests pass, and only s11g t13 remains.

**Rulings:**
- **RV77-S1 is fixed before acceptance.** Three enforced rules have no committed test:
  - a positive floor forcing its stop at L = 0;
  - null refused on a passed G5a;
  - non-null coverage requiring `capture.source`.
  
  I61 adopts RV77's tests (`tests/rv77_enum.rs`, `tests/rv77_pp.rs`) into the fenced test files. Mutants R1, R6 and R10 must then be killed by the committed suite. RV77 confirms the new head.
- **N3 is fixed in the same pass:** the comment at `retained_product_tests.rs:3126` claims a refusal the test doesn't assert. I61 corrects the comment, or asserts the actual behaviour.
- **N2 is corrected in an addendum to I61's RETURN:** the per-body scans are unmetered, not "reads", and the 16 B `SummaryCoverage` is a conservative double count.
- **N1** (five equivalent or unreachable mutants) is recorded.
- **N4** (the crate-visible `certificate` field, through which crate code could pair a foreign proof) is carried with the deferred structural owner binding, to the receipt-transaction design.

## Rust and TypeScript aligned to snapshot 05a; the Xcode licence blocks linking; two more parity rules (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

All three readers now pass snapshot 05a: 104 mutations at their expected first gate and code, and 15 of 15 must-pass entries. Eligibility stays closed in every reader. Each is committed on READER as unaccepted work.

| Reader | READER commit | Files | ROOT's own run |
|---|---|---|---|
| TypeScript (I64) | `ee90efd18d` | `retainedPrecision.ts` `4ce47b8a89`, `retainedPrecision.test.ts` `c643e8734d` | Vitest 161/161, tsc 0 |
| Rust (I63) | `48b7aa2a1b` [Correction (ROOT, 2026-10-03): the commit is `706c8558f2`; ROOT typed a hash that names nothing] | `retained_precision.rs` `93fee7bd09`, its test file `09eea1995c` | 14/14 |

**A correction to I62's C1a RETURN.** It said Rust had no Φ check. Rust's inherited G5b already checked `floor == phi_512(e_hat(E, L))` with exact bits. I63 has now made `e_hat` and `phi_512` public mirrors of the native functions, with no behaviour change.

**The host's Xcode licence (owner action needed).** Xcode on this Mac was modified at 14:39 local today (`Xcode.app`'s timestamp), and its licence has not been accepted. `xcrun` exits 69, so Rust test binaries fail to link. Accepting it (`sudo xcodebuild -license`) is the owner's to do; ROOT and TASKs don't.
- **Interim ruling, local tests only:** cargo processes may set `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`, the installed Command Line Tools. No system setting changes, and each record discloses the setting.
- **No gate evidence** (DEC-025, final gates) is produced with this setting. Gates wait for the licence, or for the owner's explicit direction.

**Two more parity rules for all readers** (snapshot 05b pins each with a shared mutation):
- **Gate order across cases.** I57 keeps G0→…→G8, with earlier gates winning, so the first failure is the earliest gate across all cases: every case's G5a before any case's G5b. That is what Rust does. Python currently checks per case (G5a then G5b), so a G5b defect in an earlier selected case can be reported ahead of a G5a defect in a later unavailable case. I62 confirms this reading against the C1 contract text in C1b and aligns Python, or reports a conflict.
- **Record body order.** For both selected and unavailable attempts, the verification record's resolution and theta entries must list bodies in ascending order 0..n−1. That is Rust's rule; Python currently compares sorted sets.

**Next:** I62's C1b, with all three readers frozen on 05a.

**ROOT's method change after two wrong hashes in one hour:** rulings that cite a commit now take the hash from Git by command substitution in the same command that writes them. No hash is typed by hand.

## Snapshot 05b verified; three non-native must-pass entries retired as 05c; producer-solved witnesses deferred (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**Snapshot 05b is verified,** and committed on READER as `8430571cc4` with Python's gate-major alignment.
- **The new hashes:** corpus `ea6fe2c757`, `retained_precision.py` `3b12ca7511`.
- **05a's content is byte-identical inside 05b:** 6 cases, 104 mutations and 15 must-pass entries.
- **05b adds:**
  - three synthetic cases: two bodies; a p512 ladder with Φ positive on the loaded body and zero on the unloaded one; two selected load cases;
  - 17 mutations, including the cross-case order and record-order pins;
  - 4 must-pass entries.
- **ROOT's own Python run:** 167 passed. The records (SHARED_SNAPSHOT_05B, RETURN_C1B, SHA256SUMS_C1B) verify.

**Gate-major order is confirmed by the contract:** C3_DELTA §4 ("Keep C1 order G0,…,G8 … First failure wins") and C1 §6. Python now runs each gate across all cases before the next. An empty body or a non-finite normalized value fails at G5a, as in Rust, because both are prerequisites of the G5a resolution tests.

**Rulings:**
- **Three 05a must-pass entries are retired,** because their stated native path cannot occur:
  - `cert_failed_after_summary` and `cert_failed_predicate_null_undetectable` claim a numeric predicate failure in case 1 of base F. That case repeats case 0's inputs, and case 0 passed its certificate. The accounting-trigger replacement `cert_failed_after_summary_accounting` (from 05b) stands.
  - `old_operational_error_new_ready` claims a coefficient-range refusal on ordinary operands, with no established native trigger. It stays open until a trigger is shown.
  
  I62 removes all three as snapshot 05c and records why. Every other entry stays byte-identical.
- **The native Ceiling row and the L = 0 base are deferred until the producer can emit real receipts** (the receipt transaction, resume step 4). A faithful Ceiling needs a case with genuinely different numerics, and L = 0 needs a confirmed producer admission. Synthetic attestation cannot supply either faithfully.
- **Next:** I63 (Rust) and I64 (TypeScript) align to 05c: the 17 new mutations and the remaining must-pass entries, gate-major order across cases, record body order, and failing an empty body or non-finite normalized value at G5a.

## All three readers pass snapshot 05c; coverage implemented; the reader audit is planned next (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**The selected summary-coverage design is now implemented in the shared contract and all three readers.** Each passes snapshot 05c (READER `e510266332`): 9 cases, 121 mutations at their expected first gate and code, and 16 must-pass entries. Eligibility stays closed everywhere.

|---|---|---|
| Python (I62) | `e510266332` | 164 passed |
| Rust (I63) | `3e915c0c1b` | 15/15; source unchanged since 05a |
| TypeScript (I64) | `18ce79d74d` | Vitest 188/188, tsc 0 |

The producer seam (I61) awaits RV77's confirmation of its review fixes.

**The coverage work is not yet accepted.** It is accepted together with the remaining reader audit, after a fresh, complete, independent review with joint parity (resume step 3).

**The remaining reader obligations** (I58, I59 and I60 RETURNs, less what 05a to 05c now cover):
- **A shared G5 obligation set,** with exhaustive branches: native terminal, reason and reference domains; reuse, skipped-precision, refusal, cache-failure and overshoot paths; group, call and source coverage; ordinary and source_decline relationships; C3 typed error, stage and failure-prefix precedence within the gate; source-bound work, status and completion.
- **Shared controls for:**
  - conversions and underflow;
  - material and unit variants (G8 named and interpolated material, project-length normalization, interpolation-alpha validity, source-specific normalization refusals);
  - a decisive literal G7 malformed-base mutation;
  - G8 failed-prefix association and source/map boundaries;
  - post-helper failure;
  - a maxima-failed, merged-before-values positive;
  - exact final-row and native coverage.
- **Producer-solved witnesses stay deferred:** the Ceiling, L = 0, source-construction failure and old-Err/new-Ready.

**The method:**
1. **One contract-derived G5 checklist,** so the three readers audit against a single list. I62 first writes the checklist and a snapshot-06 plan covering the families above. Each item cites its native path and contract clause, and items that need a producer-solved witness are marked deferred.
2. **ROOT reviews the plan.** I62 then builds 06 and the Python audit, while I63 and I64 audit Rust and TypeScript against the same checklist and align to 06.
3. **Then a fresh, complete, independent review** of all three readers and the shared corpus, with a joint parity run on 06.

## Reader audit plan approved: one 42-item G5 checklist and snapshot 06 in two grants (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

I62's `READER_AUDIT_PLAN.md` (sha256 `ee3cc5918c`) is approved. It has two parts:
- **A G5 obligation checklist of 42 items.** Each item gives its contract clause, its native path at `652ad0cc1f`, its error code, and its place in the within-gate order of C3:294–304: native schedule first, then C3 references and the stage/lane sequence, then typed check consistency, then the work equations. The items cover:
  - native schedule, terminal and reason: 17;
  - cache, build, call and group: 6;
  - ordinary and source_decline: 5;
  - C3 typed errors, stages and prefixes: 11;
  - source-bound work, status and completion: 4.
- **A snapshot-06 plan of 16 items,** with the items that need producer-solved witnesses deferred: the Ceiling, L = 0, source-construction failure, old-Err/new-Ready, positive subnormal or underflow rows, budget overshoot or an exhausted meter, ordinary W2, and combination calls.

**Rulings on I62's three questions:**
- **G7 codes.** C1's G7 row says "existing base failure codes", so first-failure parity compares the bare base code. Every reader reports the bare code as its error code. Any detail text is carried separately and never as part of the code, and the base validators themselves are not changed.
- **Row-index coverage.** C3's G3 row covers "member-prefix and row-index coverage", so missing, foreign or unsorted row indices fail at G3 with COVERAGE_MISMATCH. A valid sorted subset on a Ready case fails at G5 with PRODUCT_ATTEMPT_MISMATCH, under typed result consistency.
- **Synthetic triggers.** Items 3 (a shared failed build reused across cases) and 16 (a work-accounting terminal) may use synthetic triggers, under the rule already set: the path must be reachable only through a resource, accounting or cache fault, and the trigger is labelled synthetic.

**The sequence:**
1. **C2-1:** I62 builds snapshot 06a (plan items 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13), and closes Python's checklist gaps.
2. **Rust (I63) and TypeScript (I64)** then audit against the same checklist and align to 06a.
3. **C2-2** follows for the rest.
4. **Then one fresh, complete, independent review** of all three readers and the corpus, with a joint parity run.

The docstring correction to the Python-only old-Err test is committed on READER.

## Producer coverage seam accepted and merged into NUM (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**I61's typed C3 coverage seam is accepted at its bounded scope** and merged into NUM (merge `f044127b1c`, second parent `fa225abded`). Its maintained source equals the reviewed head exactly. The merge also carries the F1a test-file repair (`e0fc33b4f7`), so NUM's F1a regression is fixed.
- **RV77:** PASS, with S1 fixed and N3 corrected. Its confirmation at `fa225abded` verified that its tests went in verbatim and that the surviving mutants R1, R6 and R10 are now killed. frame_kernel `--lib`: 480 passed. product_physics `--lib`: only the known Mac test `s11g t13` fails.
- **The toolchain deviation:** those runs linked with the Command Line Tools (`DEVELOPER_DIR`) under the interim ruling. The evidence is local acceptance evidence, not gate evidence.

**This is a local fan-in, not a main merge.** The seam carries no serializer or public receipt. Producer custody and the owner binding (RV77-N4) are carried to the receipt-transaction design. The stale status line in I61's ADDENDUM_RV77 (it names branch head `e0fc33b4f7`) is noted, not edited.

## Snapshot 06a and the Python checklist audit verified (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**Snapshot 06a and the Python audit are committed on READER as `e7dac8d4d9`.**
- **The new hashes:** corpus `58562c88dc`, `retained_precision.py` `5bb6357a36`, test file `514745e245`.
- **05c's content is byte-identical inside 06a.** 06a adds three synthetic native-ladder bases and 30 mutations, for 12 cases, 151 mutations and 16 must-pass entries in all. No existing expected outcome moved.
- **ROOT's own Python run:** 196 passed. The records (SHARED_SNAPSHOT_06A, RETURN_C2_1, SHA256SUMS_C2_1) verify.

**RETURN_C2_1 is now the authoritative status table for the 42 checklist IDs.**
- **Checked by shared mutations or bases:** 33 IDs.
- **Checked only by Python reader-logic tests** (shared base deferred): N5, N8, N10 and O5.
- **Partly checked:**
  - N9: the work-accounting fault cause is not publicly derivable, so it stays attested;
  - N17: the overshoot rules are implemented, but a shared base needs 20B or 60B of real work.
- **Implemented but untested:** N11 (refused group); no native-faithful base has been found.
- **Not publicly checkable:** W4.

**Python's within-G5 order now follows C3:304:** native schedule, then ordinary, then C3 association, then typed checks, then the C3 work equations, which run after every attempt's association checks.

**Next:** Rust (I63) and TypeScript (I64) audit against the same 42 IDs and align to 06a. C2-2 (plan items 4, 5, 11, 14, 15 and 16) follows.

## TypeScript checklist audit verified; three native readings settled against Python (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**The TypeScript audit against all 42 IDs and 06a is committed on READER as `90d61a05fc`.** ROOT's own runs: Vitest 232/232, tsc 0. The records (`I64/reader_audit_06a/`, with the ID → status table) verify.

I64 reported six places where TypeScript reads the native code differently from Python. **ROOT read the native code** (`adaptive.rs` at NUM, line numbers taken from the file) **and settles three of them in TypeScript's favour:**
- **N9.** The native solver can end on WorkAccounting after an escalating stop. Whenever any attempt's work status is not exact, the ladder calls `finish_terminal` (`:4769`) before the escalation check. `finish_terminal` returns `WorkAccounting { fault, prior: Some(stop) }` when a fault exists. So Python's requirement of the Ceiling after any escalating last stop would reject genuine receipts. Python must accept WorkAccounting there. [Correction (ROOT, 2026-10-03): this describes the native solver correctly, but misses C1:66–68. Every native work fault (Overflow, Inconsistent, Both; `work.rs`) is a checked inconsistency or a counter beyond range, which prevents successor emission and abandons finalization. So no emitted receipt can carry a WorkAccounting terminal, and readers must reject one rather than accept it. See "Snapshot 06b verified; WorkAccounting terminals cannot appear in a receipt".]
- **N5.** Only WorkAccounting can end a run on an escalating stop. `terminal()` (`:4349`) maps each terminal stop to exactly one reason and is unreachable for escalating stops (`:4377`). So a non-WorkAccounting terminal must be the exact translation of a terminal stop. Python's acceptance of any non-selected terminal is too permissive, and Python aligns to TypeScript's rule.
- **N10.** A meter fault takes precedence over exhaustion for idle runs: `WorkAccounting { prior: None }` before `Budget(Invocation)` (`:4996`). Python must accept the idle WorkAccounting case when a fault exists. [Correction (ROOT, 2026-10-03): this describes the native solver correctly, but misses C1:66–68. Every native work fault (Overflow, Inconsistent, Both; `work.rs`) is a checked inconsistency or a counter beyond range, which prevents successor emission and abandons finalization. So no emitted receipt can carry a WorkAccounting terminal, and readers must reject one rather than accept it. See "Snapshot 06b verified; WorkAccounting terminals cannot appear in a receipt".]

**Three readings are still open, for C2-2 to settle against the contract and native code, with citations:**
- **N17:** which scope wins when both the case and the invocation limits are exceeded. TypeScript's inherited rule is unverified.
- **P5:** whether the conversion kind/bits check also covers preparation-member conversions, as TypeScript does.
- **P7:** whether retained old operational tuples are bound for every attempt (TypeScript) or only for sourceless attempts (Python). The two are equivalent on the corpus.

**The `prior` field is open too.** Native `WorkAccounting` carries `prior`. I64 removed it from the TypeScript terminal as absent from the wire format. C2-2 confirms against C1 and C3 whether the wire projection omits it, and the independent review checks that.

**C2-2 pins all of these with shared entries:** must-pass entries for the genuine N9 and N10 native shapes (using the synthetic accounting trigger, under the standing rule) and mutations for N5's over-acceptance. Rust's audit (I63) is awaited first, so its readings are included.

## Rust checklist audit verified; N17 settled from native code; the remaining readings go to C2-2 (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**The Rust audit against all 42 IDs and 06a is committed on READER as `5467f46e7b`.** ROOT's own run: 19/19, linked with the Command Line Tools. The records (`I63/reader_audit_06a/`) verify. Rust's per-ID status matches TypeScript's in shape:
- checked by Rust reader-logic tests only: N5, N8, N10 and O5;
- partly checked: N9 and N17;
- no control: N11;
- not publicly checkable: W4.

**N17 is settled by the native code.** The budget test (`adaptive.rs:276`) checks the case room before the invocation room, so an invocation-scope Budget implies the case limit was not exceeded. Rust and TypeScript already enforce this. Python aligns. Idle runs (no attempts) carry no case usage, so the rule holds trivially there.

**For C2-2 to settle against the contract and native code, with citations:**
- **G7 code families.** The base validators report different families: Python's base reports every evidence failure as `EVIDENCE_INVALID: <detail>`, while Rust's unchanged base reports finer codes (here `SOURCE_PREVIEW_PHYSICS_EXTREMA_BOUNDS`). C1's G7 row says "existing base failure codes", so no reader remaps a base code until C2-2 establishes how the existing base contract specifies codes across languages (semantic-contract fixtures, existing parity tests):
  - if the base contract fixes one cross-language family, use it;
  - if it allows each language's own codes, the corpus expects per-language G7 codes.
  
  Rust's current mapping (finer codes reported as `SOURCE_PREVIEW_PHYSICS_EVIDENCE_INVALID`, with the finer code in `detail`) stays provisional.
- **P5 scope.** Rust and TypeScript check conversions on every member; Python does not. Is C3's P5 every conversion?
- **P7.** Old-tuple binding for every attempt (TypeScript) or only sourceless ones (Python, Rust).
- **O2.** Rust also requires a diagnostic reference to affect the case and appear in `diagnostic_refs`.
- **WorkAccounting's `prior`.** Whether the wire format carries it.

**C2-2's scope:**
- plan items 4, 5, 11, 14, 15 and 16;
- the settlements above, with citations;
- Python's alignment to N5, N9, N10 and N17;
- shared entries pinning N5, N9, N10 and N17, and whatever the settlements decide.

Then the readers align, and one fresh, complete, independent review follows.

## Snapshot 06b verified; WorkAccounting terminals cannot appear in a receipt; invocation edits added to the shared format (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**Snapshot 06b is verified,** and committed on READER as `b50f2fe174` with Python's settlements.
- **The new hashes:** corpus `e7983fc641`, `retained_precision.py` `ddf85962c3`, test file `1c14810343`.
- **The changes to existing entries are exactly the two I62 declared:**
  - `g7_maximum_off_enclosure` gains per-reader codes;
  - `prefix_old_inputs_unbound` moves from the mutations to the must-pass entries, under the P7 settlement.
- **06b adds:** three bases (two stiffness groups, interpolated material, millimetre units), 13 mutations and 7 must-pass entries. The totals are 15 cases, 163 mutations and 23 must-pass entries.
- **ROOT's own Python run:** 215 passed. The records (SHARED_SNAPSHOT_06B, RETURN_C2_2, SHA256SUMS_C2_2) verify.

**I62's settlements are accepted, each with its citation in RETURN_C2_2:**
- **G7:** each language keeps its own base code. The base contract fixes only the `SOURCE_PREVIEW_PHYSICS_` prefix (S1_INTERFACE.md:138), and the corpus carries per-reader expectations. Rust drops its provisional remap.
- **P5:** the conversion rule covers every conversion, including refused preparation members (C3:182–195).
- **P7:** old inputs are bound wherever a PreparedMember exists, for every attempt. Other old entries stay producer attestations (F1:101–106; C3:155–158).
- **O2:** Rust's stricter reference rule is correct (C2:166).
- **`prior`:** not carried on the wire. The closed schema has `work_accounting {fault}` only (C3:261–263), pinned at G1.

**A correction to ROOT's N9 and N10 rulings.** C1:66–68: "A checked inconsistency, max counter, sum beyond u64, or count beyond the safe JSON range prevents selected successor emission". An unencodable run abandons successor finalization. Every native work fault (`WorkFault`: Overflow, Inconsistent, Both) is one of these. So **no emitted receipt carries a WorkAccounting terminal, idle or not.**
- **All readers reject a WorkAccounting terminal in a receipt** at G5 with ATTEMPT_MISMATCH, as a terminal outside the emitted domain. I62 confirms the gate and code against C1/C3 in C2-3, or reports a different citation.
- **N5's exact-translation rule and N17 stand.** An idle run at exhaustion is Budget(Invocation). An idle run in a ready group is refused `ledger_unavailable` (I62's N10 finding).
- **The C3 schema still lists `work_accounting {fault}`.** That is recorded as a contract tension for the independent review and a later C3 clarification: the closed type is total, but the emission rule excludes the value. This narrows what readers accept to what producers can emit, and changes no public meaning.

**The shared format is extended:** mutations may also edit the invocation. Each reader's harness applies these invocation edits before validating. This lets the invocation-level G8 refusals become shared entries instead of Python-only tests: an un-normalized coordinate, missing alpha, a duplicate temperature, a strict bracket at a point.

**Next:**
1. **I62's C2-3 builds snapshot 06c:**
   - WorkAccounting-rejection mutations, replacing the acceptance tests;
   - the invocation-edit format and the invocation-level G8 mutations;
   - Python aligned.
2. **I63 and I64 align to 06c:**
   - per-reader G7, with Rust's remap dropped;
   - P7 narrowed;
   - the N10 idle rules;
   - WorkAccounting rejection;
   - P5 and O2 where they differ;
   - invocation edits in their harnesses.
3. **Then the independent review.**

## Snapshot 06c verified; readers align; product-level accounting causes to be settled (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**Snapshot 06c is verified,** and committed on READER as `c765e4f5b3`.
- **The new hashes:** corpus `d4235f59b6`, `retained_precision.py` `3200f56020`, test file `354821ddf4`.
- **The change to existing entries is the one declared:** `escalating_end_requires_work_accounting` is renamed `ceiling_before_last_slot`, with its content unchanged.
- **06c adds 10 mutations:** three WorkAccounting rejections at G5 ATTEMPT_MISMATCH, and seven invocation-level G8 refusals. The totals are 15 cases, 173 mutations and 23 must-pass entries.
- **ROOT's own Python run:** 221 passed. The records verify.

**The gate and code for WorkAccounting rejection are confirmed:** C1:66–68 forbids emission, C1:148 puts the terminal at G5, and the closed schema (C3:261–263) still admits the shape, so it isn't G1. The `invocation_edits` semantics are specified in SHARED_SNAPSHOT_06C.json.

**Next:**
- **I63 and I64 align to 06c:**
  - per-reader G7, with Rust's remap dropped;
  - P7 narrowed to attached PreparedMembers;
  - the N10 idle rules;
  - WorkAccounting rejection;
  - P5 and O2 where they differ;
  - `invocation_edits` in their harnesses;
  - the renamed id.
- **I62 settles, as analysis only, whether C1:66–68 also reaches product-level `work_accounting` causes.** Several must-pass entries use synthetic accounting triggers, for example `cert_failed_before_summary`. If such a receipt cannot be emitted, those entries are not native-faithful and must be replaced or retired.
- **I62 also adds a tightened sibling** of 06b's `idle_budget_below_invocation_limit`, which does not isolate its target.

## All three readers pass snapshot 06c (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**All three readers pass the complete snapshot-06c corpus:** 15 cases, 173 mutations at their expected first gate and code (per reader where the corpus says so), and 23 must-pass entries. No reader reports a remaining divergence from the others on 06c. Eligibility stays closed in every reader, and nothing is accepted.

| Reader | Commit | ROOT's own run |
|---|---|---|
| Python (I62) | `c765e4f5b3` | 221 passed |
| Rust (I63) | `3154d5eb5d` | 22/22, linked with the Command Line Tools |
| TypeScript (I64) | `8e70db0198` | Vitest 270/270, tsc 0 |

**The probes isolate the new checks.** I63 ran the previous 06a Rust reader under the new harness: it failed exactly the six entries this grant targets. I64's 06a baseline failed exactly six. One raising-line difference is recorded: `idle_work_accounting_run` raises at TypeScript's N10 idle line but Python's WorkAccounting line, with the same G5 ATTEMPT_MISMATCH.

**Open before the independent review:**
- I62's analysis of whether product-level `work_accounting` causes can be emitted (C2-4). It may retire or replace must-pass entries that use synthetic accounting triggers.
- The C3 schema's `work_accounting` shape, for the review and a later clarification.

## Accounting triggers: only allocator refusals are emittable; F and P rebased as snapshot 06d (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**I62's analysis `ACCOUNTING_CAUSES.md` (sha256 `d562af562d`) is accepted.** It shows that some synthetic accounting triggers ROOT allowed describe receipts that could never be emitted.
- **The kernel:** C1:66–68 blocks emission on a non-exact kernel work status.
- **Product work:** C3:207 and C3:232–236 allow an unavailable product attempt with a non-exact status, provided every value the receipt must carry is the real retained value and is at most 2^53−1. Otherwise the whole receipt falls back to `receipt_encoding`.

**The verdicts by class, from native code:**
- **Adapter overflow** (`adapter.fault`): never emittable. A fault leaves the count at 2^62 or more.
- **Scalar trace loss** (`lost`): never emittable. It occurs only with a counter at u64::MAX.
- **Product work-status faults:** representable in principle, but overflow either forces the fallback or has no producer witness, and Inconsistent arises only from broken invariants. No corpus use is faithful.
- **Storage (allocator refusal):** emittable.

**The standing synthetic-trigger rule is narrowed.** A synthetic trigger is allowed only for a resource fault whose receipt is emittable under C1 and C3, which today means an allocator (storage) refusal at an actual reserve site. Counter overflow, trace loss and invariant-violation triggers are not allowed. ROOT's earlier rulings that allowed "accounting faults" are read with this narrowing.

**Snapshot 06d (I62's C2-5):**
- **Rebase base F onto F′:** a refused verdict-copy allocation, `storage{"adapter vector"}` (PP:3362–3365).
- **Rebase base P onto P′:** a refused prepared-vector reserve (PP:3086).
- **Recheck every entry derived from F or P** against the new stage shape, including the 17 mutations that inherit their triggers. Pinned defects stay pinned. If an expected outcome moves, report it with the reason.
- **Replace seven must-pass entries with storage causes:** `prefix_captured`, `prefix_unequal_helper_new`, `maxima_abandoned`, `aliases_abandoned`, `bind_rows_abandoned`, `values_failed_separate_completion` and `cert_failed_before_summary`. Rebase `prefix_unattached_old_operand_attested` onto P′.
- **Retire or defer five entries,** with the reason recorded for each: `prefix_after_new_evaluator`, `observables_failed_after_certificate`, `g5a_failed_after_certificate`, `cert_failed_after_summary_accounting` (unless a reserve follows coverage formation) and `prefix_helper_refused`.
- **Add three reader rules at G5, WORK_MISMATCH,** under C3:232–236 and the class facts above:
  - R1: reject a non-null `adapter.fault`;
  - R2: reject any `lost = true`;
  - R3: a `work_accounting {fault}` cause requires its owning trace's status to contain that fault.
  
  Python implements them first, after the rebase, so the G3 and G5a pins on F′ and P′ keep their intended first failures.
- **Add the tightened idle sibling** `idle_budget_not_exhausted_no_group`. It is expected at G5 ATTEMPT_MISMATCH at the exhaustion rule, and I62's probe shows it isolates the rule.

**Then** I63 and I64 align to 06d, and the independent review follows.

## Snapshot 06d verified; the last reader alignment before review (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**Snapshot 06d is verified,** and committed on READER as `f1ff7ebddc`.
- **The new hashes:** corpus `d02701ed6a`, `retained_precision.py` `55736ea65a`.
- **ROOT's diff against 06c matches I62's declarations exactly:**
  - **cases:** two rebased (F′ and P′, both allocator refusals);
  - **mutations:** five new (R1, R2, R3 and the tightened idle sibling), and all 173 existing ones byte-identical;
  - **must-pass entries:** six replaced with storage causes, five retired or deferred, and `cert_failed_after_summary_accounting` renamed `cert_failed_after_summary_storage` (a `row_scales` reserve after coverage, FC:1019).
- **The totals:** 15 cases, 178 mutations and 18 must-pass entries.
- **ROOT's own Python run:** 221 passed. The records verify.

**Accepted deviations from the C2-5 grant:**
- **`prefix_unequal_helper_new` is retired, not replaced.** No allocator refusal exists between a helper's return and its new evaluator: every vector is reserved before the loop (PP:3168–3181). The proposed `prepared_string` site runs only for loads before the member loop.
- **F's original trigger is corrected:** it was the per-verdict MapWrite (PP:3364), so F′ keeps the same stage shape and no derived expectation moved.

**Deferred:** a faithful `prefix_helper_refused` (SectionError has no storage variant), and optional storage contexts for seven pin mutations.

**Next:** I63 and I64 align to 06d (R1–R3, the replaced entries, the new mutations). Then the fresh, complete, independent review of all three readers and the shared corpus, with a joint parity run.

## All three readers pass snapshot 06d; the independent review is dispatched (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**The READER head for the review is `6b607fd01f`.** Its tracked tree is clean.

- **Rust (I63), committed as `185b6ef83d`.** ROOT verified both file hashes against I63's RETURN and read the whole diff:
  - R1–R3 run at G5 WORK_MISMATCH, deferred until every attempt's association checks have passed.
  - The schedule's record, role and outcome replay now matches Python's. Before this, Rust admitted a rejected attempt whose verification record said `verified`.
  - The build state/reason check moved from a global ATTEMPT pass to WORK, per referenced build, as Python's `_g5_cache` does.
  
  Evidence: `8fb7a837f5`.
- **TypeScript (I64), committed as `6b607fd01f`.** ROOT verified both file hashes and read the whole diff:
  - R1–R3 join the deferred C3 work list.
  - O2 now applies the stricter reference rule of the 06b settlement: typed references are listed, resolve and name the case; report and W2 references are required; and a report's `outcome` must equal the case's `solve_quality`.
  - The 06d corpus is adopted.
  
  Evidence: `913c32694a`.
- **ROOT's own runs on `6b607fd01f`:**
  - Python: 221 passed.
  - Rust: 23 passed, 0 failed, with `DEVELOPER_DIR` set to the Command Line Tools for the process only.
  - TypeScript: vitest 271/271, and tsc exits 0.
- **Every reader** gives all 178 mutations their expected first gate and code (G7 per reader), passes all 18 must-pass entries, and validates all 15 cases.
- **The completeness holds remain false:**
  - Python's `_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE`, whose public entry refuses at G0;
  - Rust's `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE`;
  - TypeScript's `SUMMARY_COVERAGE_COMPLETE`.

**The known differences from Python are not settled here.** I63 lists eight, and I64 five groups, each with citations in its RETURN. No shared entry exercises any of them. Each needs a contract reading of which reader is right, so the reviewers rule on them, and each settled reading then gets a shared mutation.
- **Rust:**
  - the gate (G3 or G5) for run-id contiguity and execution order;
  - the G3 member-index rules;
  - old coverage checked against the source's member map;
  - the preparation back-reference on every sourced attempt;
  - the material basis checked against the ordinary attempt;
  - the P8 reason-table edges;
  - the order of the native checks within G5, which only matters for dual defects;
  - the Rust-only group checks.
- **TypeScript:**
  - failed-verification classification (N4/N5) on records that contradict their stop;
  - the stop-rule reason locator;
  - the candidate record shape;
  - the ordinary-pass extras and their order;
  - structural-only differences.

**For RV81:** `accountingRules` is exported for a reader-logic test. It is a pure predicate with no eligibility path, but it widens the module's surface.

**The review dispatched now:** RV78 (the shared artefacts, the corpus and the joint parity run), RV79 (Python), RV80 (Rust) and RV81 (TypeScript), per `BRIEFS/RV78_RV81_READER_REVIEW.md`, against `6b607fd01f`. Their dispatch prompts add the known-difference lists as named questions. No reader is accepted, and nothing becomes eligible, until the review's findings are resolved and confirmed.

## The Xcode licence is accepted; the toolchain override is retired (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**The owner accepted the Xcode licence.** ROOT confirmed it on the host:
- `xcodebuild -license check` exits 0;
- the selected developer directory is Xcode's;
- `xcrun` resolves `cc` (Apple clang 21.0.0) and the macOS SDK.

**From now on, Cargo runs use the default toolchain,** with no `DEVELOPER_DIR` override. Gate evidence (DEC-025, the final gates, and the T9 and both-entry runs) must come from the default toolchain.

The reader review now running (RV78–RV81) was dispatched with the override and may keep it. Its results are review evidence, not gate evidence, and each reviewer discloses the override.

## Reader review RV78–RV81: consolidated ruling and the repair wave (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**The four reviews of READER `6b607fd01f`:**

| Review | Scope | Verdict | BLOCKING / SHOULD-FIX / NOTE | Record |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RV78 | Corpus and joint parity | FAIL | 1 / 4 / 9 | `e2f7fe8b34` |
| RV79 | Python | FAIL | 2 / 5 / 7 | `d0a7e6e9ff` |
| RV80 | Rust | PASS | 0 / 2 / 8 | `0df84b882b` |
| RV81 | TypeScript | FAIL | 2 / 2 / 8 | `1762a1c25a` |

ROOT verified each record's SHA256SUMS and found no machine paths.

**ROOT also confirmed these findings in the source at `6b607fd01f`:**
- **RV80-S1:** a native error with a selected Run takes Rust's facade branch, and its `run_ref` is never compared (RS:1890, 1902–1905).
- **RV80-S2 = RV81-B1, one defect:** Rust and TypeScript check only that old member ids are unique (RS:649–652, TS:213).
- **RV81-B2:** the `prepared_product_failure` binding is checked only from the product-attempt loop (PY:835, RS:1878–1882, TS:600), and the ordinary pass skips that cause (TS:1114). A case claiming the cause without an attempt of its own is never bound, in any of the three readers.
- **RV79-B1c:** Python maps a `preparation` error without requiring a null Run (PY:839).
- **RV79-S2:** Python's ordinary, rcond and selected-case ATTEMPT checks run after `_g5_products` has raised its WORK list (PY:1446–1455).
- **RV79-S3:** a single gate variable spans G5a and G5b, and the catch-all maps ZeroDivisionError to SCALE_MISMATCH (PY:1456, 1473).

**What the review established:**
- **The corpus is sound.** All 211 entries agree across the three readers and with the contract. RV78 reproduced every hash independently and recomputed every p512 floor with exact rationals.
- **The arithmetic is sound in all three readers:** zero mismatches over about 300k exact-rational comparisons.
- **No reader can reach eligibility.**
- **The failures** are false accepts and first-gate divergences, all on inputs the corpus never exercises.

Every BLOCKING and SHOULD-FIX finding is repaired before acceptance, whatever its label.

### Decisions

**D1. G3 coverage (COVERAGE_MISMATCH)** (C1 G3 row; C3:302; F1:101, 110, 130):
- **Run ids and execution order:** each run id equals its execution-order position, and the execution order is a bijection (C2:117). Python moves this check from G5.
- **Member ids:** old, prepared and new ids are exactly `0..len−1` in native order, and prepared and new are prefixes of old (C2:98; PP:1238, 1296). Rust and TypeScript.
- **`old_coverage=complete`:** old ids equal the full member inventory.
  - For a sourced attempt, that is the source's member map, at G3. Python moves this from G5.
  - For an unsourced attempt, G3 requires a non-empty list, and the member count of any CaseSource in the receipt (there is one model). Without a CaseSource, G8 compares the list with the invocation's member count.
    [Correction, checkpoint A, 2026-10-03: the non-empty requirement is withdrawn. No native rejection of an empty member inventory has been cited (I62 CHECKPOINT_A, D1). G3 compares an unsourced complete list only with any CaseSource's member count, and G8 compares it with the invocation. The empty-inventory conditional below is not met, so empty lists are not rejected at G3.]
  - If I62 confirms from native code that an empty CaseSource inventory cannot be emitted, an empty one also fails G3 (RV80-N2b, RV79-N3).
- **`captured_prefix`:** G3 checks only the member part (no prepared and no new members). The null `source_ref`/`run_ref` and the unavailable result are G5 PRODUCT_ATTEMPT (F1:97, 130–131; C3:304). Rust and TypeScript move those checks out of G3.
- **Run origin owner and source:** these are G5 class-1 checks ("native schedule/origin", C3:304), not G3. Rust moves them.

**D2. G0 scope** (C1 G0 row; C3 G0 row). G0 covers exactly:
- the producer identity (component and schema versions);
- the definition and inherited-table hashes, computed over the bound bytes;
- `receipt_version` (v2, refusing v1 relabels);
  [Correction, 2026-10-03: C1 §4 fixes `receipt_version:1`. "Corrected v2" in C1's G0 row is the `M03-INTEGRITY-MP-v2` policy id, and v1 relabels are refused by the policy check. The receipt version itself must be exactly 1.]
- the policy ids;
- the canonicalization profile;
- the 20B and 60B thresholds.

All three readers check this union at G0. A G0 field that is absent or of the wrong type fails G0; every other shape defect waits for G1. The changes:
- Python adds the thresholds and canonicalization, rather than relying on schema constants, and types its malformed-producer error (RV79-N2).
- TypeScript adds the component and schema versions, and hashes the table bytes.

**D3. G5 order** (C3:304). Four classes, in order:
1. native schedule/origin, including native WORK;
2. C3 run/source/ordinary references and the stage/lane sequence;
3. typed checks;
4. the C3 work/status/conversion-prefix/merge equations.

Python moves its ordinary, rcond and selected-case checks into class 2 (RV79-S2, RV78 T-4e). The contract fixes no order inside class 1, so ROOT sets a convention for the C3 clarification: a native class containing an ATTEMPT defect reports ATTEMPT, and reports WORK only when it has no ATTEMPT defect. Readers defer native WORK predicates to the end of class 1, as C3 defers its own work equations. This fixes the first code for every dual defect (R-7). The per-check ATTEMPT/WORK mapping is the shared convention already in the readers; I62 tabulates it and reports any check where the readers differ (RV78-N7).

**D4. Association (G5 PRODUCT_ATTEMPT), in all readers:**
- **a.** On every sourced attempt, `source.preparation` is non-null and its `attempt_ref` equals the attempt (C3:146–148).
- **b.** `attempt.material_basis_ref` equals its ordinary attempt's (C3:165).
- **c.** A case with a `prepared_product_failure` cause has its own `product_attempt_ref`, equal to the cause's (S06 §1; C3:165 "resolves once"). Applies to all three readers.
- **d.** The reason table (S06 §1):
  - `preparation` requires a null Run and a failed preparation;
  - `native` requires a nonselected Run (selected is invalid), and its `run_ref` must equal the case's Run id;
  - `capture` follows Run presence and terminal, as S06 tabulates.
- **e.** `run_ref` is null if and only if no native call happened (C3:167).

**D5. Native records (G5 ATTEMPT):**
- **a.** A candidate record has a null verification, no verification shared build, and `verification_lme` 0 (C1:105; adaptive.rs:4076–4079, 4333).
- **b.** An escalating stop on a failed verification is a solve failure. A record showing the verification pass ran with such a stop is invalid (adaptive.rs:4593–4611, 4377).
- **c.** `rejected(verification_failed)` requires the failed phase.
- **d.** A stop-rule reason's quantity resolves to a layout row with the same body and kind (C2:22, :54; C1:114).
- **e.** A group's call exists, and its sources are unique and listed in that call (C2:119, :135).

**D6. The ordinary pass (G5 ATTEMPT, class 2):**
- **a.** `diagnostic_refs` are unique and resolve (C1:100; the G5 row's "ordinary refs resolve"). Whether each listed diagnostic must name the case depends on the producer. I62 checks the producer's ordinary diagnostic list: if it lists only diagnostics naming the case, every reader enforces that; otherwise no reader does, and TypeScript drops its check (RV81 4a).
- **b.** A selected case's `solve_quality` is not `checks_passed` (C1:101; C2:164). For `not_assessed`, I62 checks I30's routing, and the readers admit exactly the statuses that route to retained precision.
- **c.** A published W2 has a nonzero `force_scale_exponent`, and its trigger matches the initial failure's kind and error (C2:158).
- **d.** `legacy_source.work_ref` resolves into `legacy_source_work`, with `case_index` equal to the case. It is a reference check, so the code is G5 ATTEMPT (C2:166). TypeScript changes its code from WORK, and Python and Rust add the check (RV81-N2).

**D7. G4:** every RETAINED_PRECISION_SELECTED or _UNAVAILABLE diagnostic names exactly one requested case, so one naming no requested case fails G4 (C1 G4 row; RV79-B2f).

**D8. The accounting class** (RV78-S2). The R1–R3 class facts apply to the meaning (an accounting event, a fault, a lost flag), not to the field spelling. I62:
- enumerates every schema shape carrying an accounting event, a fault or a lost flag, with its native emission condition;
- proposes R1′–R4, all at G5 WORK. RV78's starting point:
  - R3′: any fault-bearing cause, whatever its spelling;
  - R2′: OperationalError and G5a-operational accounting are never emittable;
  - R4: SectionError accounting requires a non-exact PreparationWork status;
- rebases `prefix_attached_old_input_unbound` first (RV78-N2);
- states whether R3 can bind to the owning trace or only to the attempt (RV80-N5, RV81-N4).

ROOT rules on the proposal.

**D9. Schema:**
- **a.** Remove the Refusal variants `work_accounting{fault}` and `count_range{name}`. Native has five variants (adaptive.rs:2860–2875), as do C2:41–45 and C1:114. Add a G1 mutation for each. If I62 finds a contract or native source for either, it stops and reports instead.
- **b.** "No source" on an unavailable case gets one encoding: whatever the producer's `retained_receipt` projection emits. The other encoding fails G1, and `source_decline` excludes `source_ref` (RV78-N3).
- **c.** Add a `$comment`: the integer and bit constraints are G2 (RV78-N4).
- **d.** The later C3 clarification records three things:
  - the type domain may exceed the emitted domain, and G5 enforces the emitted one (RV78-N8);
  - the D3 convention;
  - the per-check mapping.

**D10. Python only:**
- An arithmetic fault in G5b (zero area or modulus) reports G5b's adopted code (RV79-S3).
  [Correction, D18, 2026-10-03: a zero area or modulus is a section-truth defect, caught by the G5b echo's positivity check as SECTION_MISMATCH. It is not reached as SCALE through arithmetic. D10's arithmetic-fault rule applies only to faults no adopted check catches first.]
- Counters must be JSON integers; an integral float fails G2 (RV79-N5).
  [Correction, D25, 2026-10-03: withdrawn. Readers validate parsed JSON values; under I-JSON and JCS, `17.0` and `17` are the same number with the same canonical hash. Python drops the integral-float rule.]

**D11. Corpus 07** (I62). Shared mutations for:
- every D1–D7 and D9 relation with a faithful base, starting from RV78's PROBES.json edits;
- the S4 gaps: P8 on F′ and on P′, C6, N13 (including a rejected attempt with a `verified` record), O1, W3, N1, N7, N11 and W2;
- equal-E variants for the strict-bracket pins (RV78-N1).

Pins that need a deferred base stay deferred and are listed. The format admits only `rehash:"all"`: each harness rejects any other value, and Rust's edit handles array removal (RV78-N5).

**D12. The checklist:**
- N11 is corrected. A group preparation refusal gives a Run with its group index (adaptive.rs:5043, `Some(index)`), a refused terminal and no attempts. Group null belongs to the exhausted-before-start Run (C2:209 item 3).
- The checklist has 43 IDs, not 42.
- I62 updates the status table for the 13 IDs RV79 disputes.

**D13. Reader-local pins** for rules with no shared base:
- theta = +0 on a no-data body;
- the Ceiling after a p128 verification-solve failure;
- R3 with `both`;
- the 2^-988 switch in the absolute bound, on both sides;
- the strict bracket.

Each reader also adds tests that kill its review's surviving mutants wherever the rule is implemented.

**D14. Exports:** the test-only exports stay, marked internal: `@internal` in TypeScript, `#[doc(hidden)]` in Rust (RV80-N4, RV81-N5).

**D15. Small items:**
- Rust's stale comment (RV80-N6).
- I63's outcome file must list all 178 mutations (RV78-N9).
- RV79-N7 (the dead recheck) is the author's choice.
- The WASM assets missing from a `git archive` are not a defect. They are untracked build outputs in `public/`; reviewers copy them, as RV78 and RV81 did.

### The repair wave

Under `BRIEFS/I62_I64_REVIEW_REPAIR_07.md`. I62 (corpus and Python), I63 (Rust) and I64 (TypeScript) resume with their context.
1. **I62 checkpoint A:** the native fact checks for D1 (empty inventory), D6a, D6b, D8, D9a and D9b, the D3 per-check table and the checklist corrections. ROOT rules on them.
2. **At the same time,** I63 and I64 implement every decision that does not wait on checkpoint A, with reader-local tests built from RV78's PROBES.json edits.
3. **I62 builds snapshot 07 and repairs Python.** Then I63 and I64 adopt 07 and the conditional decisions.
4. **Confirmation:** the four reviewers resume on the repaired head. RV79–RV81 confirm their findings, and RV78 reruns parity on 07.

Cargo now uses the default toolchain (ruling of this date). No reader is accepted before step 4 passes.

## Checkpoint A: rulings on the native facts for snapshot 07 (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

I62's `CHECKPOINT_A.md` (`946a75ccd4`) is verified: SHA256SUMS OK, no machine paths, and no change in READER. ROOT checked its key citations:
- `PP/retained_receipt.rs:1` ("No serializer, public receipt…");
- `PP/source_receipt.rs:546–550` (`not_attempted` binds `not_assessed`);
- `FK/adaptive.rs:4349–4356` (`terminal()` maps CountRange and WorkAccounting to Unresolved);
- `FK/adaptive.rs:2860–2875` (five Refusal variants).

**A fact behind two items:** no producer serializer for case or ordinary receipt JSON exists yet. D6a and D9b are therefore decided from the contract. Each becomes an obligation on the producer receipt transaction (resume step 4), which must emit exactly what these rules accept.

**The rulings:**
- **D1, empty inventory.** The conditional is not met, and D1's unsourced "non-empty" clause is withdrawn (correction bracket in D1). A known limit remains: without an invocation and without any CaseSource, a wrongly sized unsourced complete list passes as `needs_recompute`. It can never become eligible, because eligibility needs the invocation, and G8 then rejects it.
- **D6a.** Untyped `diagnostic_refs` must be unique and resolve (G5 ATTEMPT, class 2). No reader requires them to name the case; TypeScript drops that check. Typed references stay strict (O2, 06b). *Producer obligation:* the ordinary list holds exactly the case's actual ordinary diagnostics, each once.
- **D6b.** A selected case's `solve_quality` is `sensitive`, `unresolved` or `failed` (G5 ATTEMPT). `not_assessed` means not attempted (source_receipt.rs:546–550), and C2:153 says a not-attempted case is never selected. Python and Rust add the rule; TypeScript already has it. I62's trace covered the report and structural-failure sites, not every PP path, and the review confirms it.
- **D8.** Adopted, all at G5 WORK in class 4:
  - **R1′:** an adapter fault, or any `accounting{event}` cause, is rejected (unchanged).
  - **R2′:** `lost`, or any OperationalError `accounting`, is rejected (PP:2311–2347).
  - **R3′:** a fault-bearing cause, in any of its three spellings (`work_accounting{fault}`, a nested `stop/work_accounting`, a view `work{fault}`), needs its fault in its owner's emitted statuses. The owner is the member work, lane work, values completion or proof trace, as I62 tabulates.
  - **R4:** a SectionError `accounting` needs a non-exact status in that member's PreparationWork (FK product_certificate.rs:676–679).
  - **Kernel scope:** a `work_accounting` stop or reason anywhere in a Run fails G5 ATTEMPT in class 1 (C1:66–68, consistent with the N9/N10 correction).
  
  **The rebase:** `prefix_attached_old_input_unbound` moves onto F′ with I62's single probed edit and keeps G8 PREPARATION. Its unsourced variant is deferred. `refused_member_conversion_kind_bits` stays as it is.
- **D9a.** Both Refusal variants are removed, and each gets a G1 RECEIPT mutation.
- **D9b.** `source_ref` is required on an unavailable case, as `null | U`. An absent `source_ref` fails G1, and `source_decline` appears only with null. The precedent is C2:133's explicit `source_ref:null`. P′ case 1 gains `source_ref: null`, and two G1 mutations are added. *Producer obligation:* emit an explicit null.
- **D3.** The table is accepted. No single-defect code differs between readers, and under the class-1 convention all 178 mutations and 18 must-pass entries keep their outcomes in Python (in-memory probe). I63 and I64 confirm this for their readers in phase 1.
- **D12.** Accepted: N11 is corrected, the checklist has 43 IDs, and RV79's status is adopted for all 13 disputed IDs.

**Next:** I63 and I64 receive the D1 correction and the D6a/D6b rulings now. I62's phase B begins:
- **B1, now:** the Python repairs in READER against 06d, with snapshot 07's shared-file edits staged under WT/scratch, not in READER.
- **B2:** after I63 and I64 finish phase 1 and ROOT commits it, I62 installs snapshot 07 in READER.

## Dangling references; TypeScript phase 1 committed (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**D16, dangling references.** A reference that does not resolve reports the code of the check that follows it, not a gate-wide catch-all default.
- In class 1, a dangling reference is an ATTEMPT defect, unless it belongs to a WORK check: a build reference, for example, is WORK under C1 build provenance.
- In classes 2 and 3, it takes the code of its association check: PRODUCT_ATTEMPT for C3 references, ATTEMPT for ordinary references.
- The readers' catch-all exception paths remain only as fail-closed fallbacks. Parity is claimed only on what snapshot 07 pins, which is at least one dangling reference per G5 class.
- TypeScript's phase-1 crash fallback ("WORK if a WORK defect was already recorded") is a heuristic and is replaced under this rule.

**TypeScript phase 1, committed as `e09b86958f`.** ROOT verified the file hashes, the evidence and both commands (vitest 315/315, tsc 0) and read the diff. It still carries the withdrawn D1 non-empty clause and the list-level D6a check. I64's follow-up removes both and applies D16.

**Granted:** I62 phase B1 (the Python repairs in READER; snapshot 07 staged in WT/scratch); the I64 follow-up. I63's phase 1 continues with the checkpoint corrections.

## Rust and TypeScript phase 1 complete; three readings settled (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**Rust phase 1, committed as `dd684fcbeb`.**
- ROOT verified the file hashes and the evidence (OUTCOMES now lists all 178 mutations), and read the decision sites.
- ROOT reran the contract test on the **default toolchain** (no `DEVELOPER_DIR`): 32 passed, 0 failed.

**TypeScript, committed as `b86ef77191`** (phase 1 plus its checkpoint-A follow-up). ROOT verified the hashes and the evidence; vitest 318/318 and tsc 0. Both readers still pass the full 06d corpus.

**The readings settled:**
1. **D16 applies as written.** A dangling build reference is a deferred WORK defect; every other class-1 reference is ATTEMPT. I63's reading is right.
2. **`receipt_version` is exactly 1** (D2 corrected in place). Rust's reading is right.
3. **An absent `retained_precision` or `body` fails G0** when the producer names the retained-precision contract. This is D2's rule that an absent G0 field fails G0. Rust already does this. TypeScript currently skips the body checks when the body is absent, so it reaches G1 instead and must change in phase 2. Python confirms in B1. Snapshot 07 pins it.
4. **A computation fault inside a WORK equation is that WORK predicate failing.** That covers a sum beyond the safe range and a negative fragment difference. It is deferred with its class (class 1 for native, class 4 for C3), and the reader continues without trusting dependent values. A non-object stage map cannot reach G5, because G1's closed shapes reject it. TypeScript's `checked` already does this; Python confirms in B1.

**Next:** I62 finishes B1. Then B2 installs snapshot 07 in READER, and I63 and I64 adopt it in phase 2.

## Python B1 verified; D17 order inside G5 class 2; B2 granted (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**I62's phase B1 is verified:**
- **Python file hashes** match RETURN_B1: `retained_precision.py` `dddac2fa96`, tests `5fb053fa46`.
- **The staged snapshot 07** matches: schema `07951edacf`, corpus `cb148a0f7d` (15 cases, 234 mutations, 19 must-pass entries).
- **The evidence** verifies.
- **ROOT's own Python run on 06d:** 266 passed and 1 failed. The failure is `prefix_attached_old_input_unbound`, moving from G8 to G5 WORK as R4 requires (ruled in checkpoint A). The 07 rebase onto F′ restores G8.
- **I62's in-memory run of staged 07:** every entry at its expectation.

The Python change is not committed alone, because its suite only passes with 07 installed. It will be committed together with 07 after B2.

**D17, the order inside G5 class 2.** C3:304 places "C3 run/source/ordinary references and allowed stage/lane sequence" in one class but fixes no order inside it. The convention: ordinary references (ATTEMPT) come first, then the C3 run/source references and the stage/lane sequence (PRODUCT_ATTEMPT). This follows TypeScript's order, ROOT's 06a record of the intended order, and RV78's T-4e reading. B2 adds one shared pin for it.

**Unreachable differences, accepted:** the fail-closed fallback codes differ (Python PRODUCT_ATTEMPT, TypeScript ATTEMPT). Every reader resolves its references explicitly under D16, and none knows an input that reaches its fallback.

**B2 granted:** install 07 in READER, add the D17 pin, update the Python counts, and write SHARED_SNAPSHOT_07.

## Snapshot 07 installed; Python repaired; phase 2 granted (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**Snapshot 07 and the Python repairs are committed on READER as `04ea067b5c`.** ROOT verified:
- **file hashes:** corpus `90f6e4ed9b`, schema `07951edacf`, Python reader `dddac2fa96`, Python tests `a0ead06840`; the schema test is unchanged;
- **the evidence:** I62's SHA256SUMS, including SHARED_SNAPSHOT_07;
- **ROOT's own Python run:** 327 passed.

**ROOT's own diff of corpus 07 against 06d:**
- **cases:** 15, of which one changed: P′ (`two_case_preparation_failure_synthetic`). The change is `source_ref: null` on case 1, the receipt hash it forces and a qualification note. The publication hash is unchanged, correctly, because it excludes the receipt.
- **mutations:** 178 carried, of which one changed: `prefix_attached_old_input_unbound`, rebased onto F′ with the single ruled edit. 57 are new.
- **must-pass entries:** 18 carried unchanged and 1 new.
- Nothing was removed, and every carried entry keeps its order. This matches I62's declaration exactly.

**Phase 2 granted** to I63 (Rust) and I64 (TypeScript): adopt 07, D8, D9 and D17, plus TypeScript's absent-body G0 change. The bar is every 07 entry at its expectation, with per-reader G7.

## Phase 2 returns; D18 section truth includes positive echo terms (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**The returns, verified and committed as WIP on READER:**
- **Rust (`16f917d616`):** 234/235 mutations, 19/19 must-pass, 15 cases. ROOT's own run gives 33 passed and 2 failed, both on `g5b_zero_section_area`. I63 stopped on that expectation, as instructed, and did not adjust it.
- **TypeScript (`babcce075e`):** 235/235, vitest 377/377, tsc 0. But to meet the same expectation, I64 removed TypeScript's G5b positivity check.

**D18 (G5b section truth).** At G5b, each of the five echoed section terms (area, section_modulus, length, axial_stiffness, torsional_stiffness) must equal the source's term **and be positive**. A failure is G5b SECTION_MISMATCH.
- **Basis:** C1's G5b row ("section truth", with the adopted section code).
- **Native positivity:** the operational evaluator rejects nonpositive E, G, A and J inputs (PP:2442) and a nonpositive length (PP:2462). EA/L and GJ/L are range-checked (PP:2360). The endpoint maximum requires area > 0 and Z > 0 (PP/source_receipt/endpoint_maximum.rs:128). So no emittable receipt carries a zero term.
- **D16 applies:** a failing check reports its own code. Python reached SCALE only through its catch-all (a ZeroDivisionError), which is a fallback, not an adopted check.
- **D10 corrected in place:** see the bracket.

**The consequences:**
- `g5b_zero_section_area` expects G5b SECTION, and a zero-length pin is added. Without D18, a zero length passes G5b in Python and TypeScript, because no stress scale divides by it.
- Python adds positivity to its echo check, and TypeScript restores its own. Rust already complies.
- TypeScript's other removal is right and stays removed. That was its G5b duplicate of the native member-property equality (`area = A_K`, `Iy_K = Iz_K`, …), which all three readers enforce at G8 (PY:1422, RS:3563, TS:1128). C1's G8 row binds "source/maps/sections".

**A rule for future briefs:** if meeting an expectation requires removing or weakening an existing check, that is a stop condition, just like an expectation believed wrong. The author reports instead of removing the check.

**Next:**
- I62 updates the expectation, adds the pin and repairs Python (07a).
- I64 restores TypeScript's positivity check.
- I63 reruns on 07a.

## Snapshot 07a verified; Python and TypeScript pass it (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**Snapshot 07a with Python's D18 change is committed on READER as `3dd3b5ff24`.**
- **ROOT's diff against 07:** exactly two changes. `g5b_zero_section_area` now expects SECTION instead of SCALE, and `g5b_zero_section_length` is new. The cases and must-pass entries are unchanged.
- **The counts:** 15 cases, 236 mutations, 19 must-pass entries.
- **ROOT's Python run:** 328 passed.

**TypeScript's D18 change is committed as `a491db2f4c`.** Positivity is restored at the G5b echo. ROOT's run gives vitest 379/379 and tsc 0.

**Rust** already gives SECTION for both pins. It needs only its count and slice updates for 07a; I63 is granted that.

## All three readers pass snapshot 07a; confirmation review dispatched (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**The READER head for confirmation is `b36739112a`.** Its tracked tree is clean.

ROOT's own runs on this head:

| Reader | Result |
|---|---|
| Python | 328 passed |
| Rust (default toolchain) | 35 passed, 0 failed |
| TypeScript | vitest 379/379; tsc exit 0 |

Every reader gives all 236 mutations their expected first gate and code (G7 per reader), passes all 19 must-pass entries, and validates all 15 cases. The completeness holds remain false in all three.

**Known differences the authors report:** only those by design (the G7 base codes per language) or unreachable (the fail-closed fallback codes, the bundled-file G0 codes, and Python's integral-float rule, which is Python-only by ruling). TypeScript's D1 sourced-coverage comparison differs from Python's only on a source map that G8 rejects in both readers, and no shared entry pins it. RV78 is asked to judge whether it needs a pin.

**Dispatched:** RV78–RV81 resume under `BRIEFS/RV78_RV81_CONFIRMATION.md`, against `b36739112a`.

## Workflow adopted: coordinated-knowledge-work; T3 self-assessment (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**The selection:** `bundled:chirality-root/coordinated-knowledge-work`, published on origin/main `e9bb7ea2c0` (WORKFLOW.md blob `26a4a77c1c`, sha256 `44049bcd38b88378…`). The owner directed "consider adopting it where appropriate". It applies to T3's coordination from here, entered at the unfinished decision with the existing evidence (preamble). It adds no gates to T3's governing requirements.

**The self-assessment against the method:**
- **§1 is not met.** T3's consumer path runs from a real producer receipt for RF-SKEW-T-CANT-OFF-122-r1e-04, through the three readers, to the published standing. It has never been traversed. The producer has no serializer (checkpoint A). Meanwhile the readers were hardened against a synthetic corpus, which "proves reader logic, not producer reachability" (RV78-N6). The reader repairs close real fail-open defects, but further expansion of the reader component waits on the unproved premise that the readers' wire contract matches what the producer will emit. The rulings already place obligations on the producer that are untested: the D6a ordinary list and the D9b explicit null.
- **§2, micro-dispatch.** About a dozen bounded grants to I62, I63 and I64 each returned within 3–25 minutes and then waited for ROOT. Standing assignments would have removed most of those round trips.
- **The preamble and §4, alignment displaced by integration.** The work graph's T3 row stayed "PAUSED" until the owner asked. The critical-path effect on T4 and T5 was raised only when asked. Status reports led with counts, which §4 says are not throughput.
- **What held:**
  - one recorded disposition for cross-owner findings (§5);
  - visible corrections, with adoption checked in the actual returns (§5);
  - return verification, with identifiers taken from source (§3);
  - versioned shared inputs with adoption boundaries (§5);
  - an independent check of the shared basis (RV78, §3).

**Changes, effective now:**
1. **The early end-to-end unit (§1).** The producer receipt transaction for the single milestone case starts now, in parallel with the running confirmation review, rather than strictly after reader acceptance. That brings forward handoff step 4's receipt work, without changing its scope or gates. Its first target: one real receipt for the milestone case, in both modes, validated by all three readers. Until that receipt passes, no new reader or corpus expansion is commissioned beyond what the confirmation review's findings require.
2. **The reader closure condition (§6).** The readers are accepted when the confirmation review passes and they validate the first real receipt. Further unexercised-input hardening is tracked, not a gate, unless it concerns a receipt the producer emits.
3. **Standing assignments (§2).** Each author owns its component through findings, repairs and the adoption of ROOT-committed snapshots, and returns at defined stop conditions and completions, not per step.
4. **Alignment (§4).** The work graph is updated at each T3 boundary, and reports lead with usable results and material gaps.

**Proposed to the owner (reserved):** activating the parts of T4 that are independent of T3's precision work, under their own WORKING_ITEMS manager on disjoint files, to shorten the critical path.
[Correction, 2026-10-03: ROOT withdrew this proposal on reflection, when the owner asked whether it still stood. The constraint is coordination capacity and T3's unproved receipt path, not production capacity (workflow §4). The boundary is not clear: T3's next step, the producer serializer, writes `core/product_physics`, the same shared facade where much of T4's mechanics lives, and the graph serializes writes to it. Revisit once the first real receipt passes all three readers and I61's scoping shows the producer's write set. Then propose only a T4 slice outside that set, if one exists (for example M07 in the frame kernel's element code).]

## Confirmation findings: disposition D19–D26 and the repair round (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**The confirmation reviews of READER `b36739112a`:**

| Review | Verdict | Findings |
|---|---|---|
| RV78 | PASS | 2 SHOULD-FIX, 5 NOTE. Full three-reader parity on 270 entries; all 60 new entries contract-faithful; no check weakened |
| RV81 | PASS | 1 SHOULD-FIX, 5 NOTE |
| RV79 | FAIL | 1 BLOCKING, 3 SHOULD-FIX, 4 NOTE |
| RV80 | Pending | Its findings join this round by a follow-up disposition |

Per workflow §5, the confirmed shared blocker (RV79-C1) is disposed of now.

**ROOT confirmed these findings in the source:**
- **RV79-C1:** the reason table runs only when a case claims `prepared_product_failure`, in all three readers (PY:903, RS:1878, TS:600).
- **RV79-C2:** D5b's evidence is `verification_lme` only (PY:616).
- **RV78-S1:** Python compares lengths (PY:1592).

**The decisions:**
- **D19, the converse of D4c (BLOCKING, all readers).**
  - A case whose product attempt is **unavailable** carries `prepared_product_failure` naming that attempt. S06 §1: existing C2 cause branches apply only "for outcomes without an actual C3 product attempt."
  - A case with a **Ready** attempt is selected, or unavailable with a `receipt_failure` cause. I62 first checks that no native path emits another cause beside a Ready attempt. If it finds one, it stops and reports, and the readers hold this half.
  - Both are G5 PRODUCT_ATTEMPT, in class 2. D4d's reason table then applies by the attempt's own error.
  - Shared pins: an unavailable C3 attempt under a C2 cause (at least facade_failure and source_error), and a `preparation` error with a selected Run under a C2 cause.
- **D20.** A selected case with no C3 attempt fails G5 PRODUCT_ATTEMPT. It is a C3 association (C3:165), checked in class 2 after the ordinary checks (D17). The readers split it out of the combined ordinary check, which reports ATTEMPT today. Shared pin.
- **D21, D5b evidence widened.** Evidence that the verification pass ran is `verification_lme` > 0 **or** a verification shared build being present. Natively that build is obtained only inside `verify_precision` (adaptive.rs:4286). Python widens to match; TypeScript already complies. Shared pin.
- **D22.** A dangling `product_attempts[i].source_ref` reports G5 PRODUCT_ATTEMPT (D16; C3:146–148). The G3 checks that depend on the source are skipped when the reference does not resolve. TypeScript fixes this; Rust checks it. Shared pin.
- **D23.** For a sourced attempt, complete old coverage compares member **ids** with the source map's `kernel_member` sequence at G3 (D1's text). Python aligns. Shared pin from RV78's probe.
- **D24, G1 hash pins.** The corpus format gains one optional field, `after_rehash`: an edit list applied after `rehash:"all"`. All three harnesses implement it. Four pins, each giving G1: a forged receipt, publication, preparation or source-identity hash. The T4c deferred note is corrected, and T4c is pinned if `after_rehash` now expresses it.
- **D25, numbers are values.** Readers validate parsed JSON values. Under the I-JSON profile and JCS, `17.0` and `17` are the same number with the same canonical hash, and TypeScript cannot tell them apart. Python drops its integral-float rule (RV78-N1). D10's integral-float clause is corrected in place.
- **D26, the D13 gap.** RV79's vector killing M21 becomes a shared pin.

**Recorded, not repaired:**
- **RV81-N4:** without an invocation, a receipt with wrong member properties passes as `needs_recompute`. It can never be eligible; this is the same limit as D1's.
- **RV78-N2:** isolating the N13 pin needs the Ceiling base (deferred list).
- **RV78-N3:** pin overlap. **RV78-N5:** D16 pins cover classes 1 and 2, the classes that read references in Python.

**The repair round, as standing assignments (workflow §2).**
- **I62 owns the corpus and Python:**
  - the D19 native check first;
  - snapshot 07b with the D19–D26 pins and the `after_rehash` format;
  - the Python repairs for D19, D20, D21, D23, D24 and D25;
  - SHARED_SNAPSHOT_07B.json in its records when installed.
- **I63 owns Rust:**
  - D19, D20 and D22 (check);
  - the `after_rehash` harness;
  - adoption of 07b;
  - RV80's findings once disposed.
- **I64 owns TypeScript:**
  - D19, D20 and D22;
  - the `after_rehash` harness;
  - the kernel-scope test's state name (RV81-N2) and a refreshed outcome file (RV78-N4);
  - adoption of 07b.

**The adoption boundary:** I63 and I64 adopt 07b once I62's SHARED_SNAPSHOT_07B.json is in its records and READER's corpus hash matches it. No ROOT round trip is needed for that step. Each author returns once: done, or stopped on a stop condition. ROOT verifies every return before commit (§3).

**Stop conditions:**
- an expectation believed wrong;
- removing or weakening a check (§2);
- a path outside the fence;
- the D19 native check failing.

## RV80 confirmation: disposition D27–D30 (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**RV80 confirms the Rust reader at PASS:** 0 BLOCKING, 2 SHOULD-FIX, 4 NOTE. Every original finding is fixed or superseded. No check was removed or weakened beyond what a decision requires. The oracle again found 0 mismatches. RV80 disclosed that a stale script briefly set `DEVELOPER_DIR`; it stopped that run before any result was recorded and reran everything on the default toolchain.

**The decisions:**
- **D27, recorded inputs in class 1 (RV80-C1).** An ATTEMPT check in G5 class 1 reads recorded receipt fields, never a value derived through a native WORK equation. Otherwise D3's deferral would report a broken WORK chain as ATTEMPT. The idle (group-null) Run rule therefore reads the Run's recorded `invocation_before` against `invocation_limit`, as Python does (PY:439, 675). That replaces the condition with the recorded value; it does not remove it. A broken meter chain reports WORK. Rust changes. Shared pin from RV80's PR14, expected G5 WORK.
- **D28, D5d widened (RV80-C2).** Every attempt reason carrying a quantity must resolve to a layout row of its Run's source with the same body and kind: `stop_rule`, `verification_estimate`, `charge` and `publication_enclosure` (C2:22–24, :54). Natively all four come from a layout row (FK/adaptive.rs:4169–4197, 4714–4720). The code is G5 ATTEMPT. All readers confirm or widen, with shared pins (at least `verification_estimate` and `publication_enclosure`).
- **D29, the empty body inventory (RV80-C4).** A CaseSource with an empty body inventory cannot be emitted: the native source constructor refuses a source with no nodes (FK/retained/source.rs:498, `NoNodes`), and I57 §1 admits no empty complete vector. It fails G3 COVERAGE. The checkpoint-A withdrawal concerned the *member* inventory and stands. Python aligns (PY:1603–1605); Rust complies. Shared pin.
- **D30, the native `run_ref` on a nonselected Run (RV80-C3).** No faithful shared base has a nonselected native Run (the deferred R-6b), so each reader adds a reader-local test that kills the M13-type mutant.

**Noted:**
- C5: three more hidden test hooks, with no path to eligibility (D14).
- C6: class 1 continues on saturated values; D27 removes the one ATTEMPT reader of such a value that RV80 found.

**Routing:** D27–D30 join the standing repair round of D19–D26, unchanged in form. I62 adds the pins and repairs Python (D28, D29). I63 covers D27, D28 and D30. I64 covers D28 and D30, and confirms D29.

## The first real receipt: a disposable projection experiment (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

I61's scoping (`R/I61/receipt_path_scoping_01/RETURN.md`) is verified: SHA256SUMS OK, no machine paths. ROOT checked two facts in the source: `PP/retained_memory.rs:2` ("no registered production profile or constructible capture permit"), and the facade path at `PP/lib.rs:2201–2229`, which installs no `ProductCapture`.

**The decisions:**
1. **The unit.** The disposable projection experiment is chosen over starting the real serializer (workflow §1: "A bounded disposable experiment is appropriate when it resolves consequential uncertainty more cheaply"). The real serializer needs the facade wiring, a permit and M, and RV77-N4's binding, and it would reach the readers last. The experiment tests the premise first.
2. **Jobs.** I61 may run the milestone case's prepared producer path in both modes (a small solve under the memory guard), plus the three readers' draft validators, through disposable harnesses in `git archive` copies under WT/scratch. Peak RSS is captured. No live worktree is touched and nothing becomes public.
3. **The route.** The test-only prepared driver (`prepare_observed → solve_native → project_candidate → typed_trace`) is accepted for the experiment. It tests the **wire contract only**, not facade custody, admission or M. **The experiment does not satisfy the first public milestone,** which still requires the actual captured facade.
4. **Provisional readings,** each an assumption recorded in the ledger, not a ruling:
   - `retained_state_sha256` = raw SHA256 of `retained_state_encoding`, by analogy with C2:91's `ledger_sha256`;
   - invocation-level diagnostics are placed where the emitter can attribute them, and the D6a tension is logged;
   - the Ordinary members are read back from the envelope, and the missing typed capture is logged as a producer gap;
   - READER's definition and semantic-table fixtures are used.
   
   Any assumption a reader result depends on becomes a ROOT ruling, with its basis, before the real serializer is built.
5. **A third receipt is included:** an actual preparation-refusal case. It exercises D9b's explicit null, the unavailable branch and D19, which the selected milestone case cannot. This is about 20% more cost.

**The standing assignment (workflow §2).** I61 owns the experiment until one of these holds:
- every receipt passes G0–G8 in all three draft readers with standing `needs_recompute`;
- only escalated tensions remain.

At the G0–G2 point, I61 writes a progress note in its records but does not return. It returns once, at completion or on a stop. The budget is 5 hours, and reaching it triggers judgment, not abandonment.

**Its basis:** READER at the committed head `b36739112a`. The repair round (D19–D30) is changing the readers at the same time. The ledger marks any mismatch already addressed by a decision in that round. The experiment is rerun on the accepted reader head before the readers are accepted.

**Stop conditions:**
- any change outside the write fence;
- a reader result that needs a contract reading to proceed (stop and report);
- removing or weakening a check in any harness;
- unexpected host load.

## Snapshot 07b and Python verified (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**Committed on READER as `bd2060d685`.** I62 returned once, with no stop condition. ROOT verified:
- **The file hashes:** Python `f6ec97fb09`, tests `57257094da`, corpus `729c12574a`; the schema is unchanged.
- **The evidence:** SHA256SUMS OK, no machine paths.
- **ROOT's own diff of 07b against 07a:**
  - 17 mutations added; nothing changed or removed; carried order kept;
  - the four G1 hash pins are the only entries using `after_rehash`;
  - the totals are 15 cases, 253 mutations and 19 must-pass entries.
- **ROOT's own Python run:** 347 passed.
- **D19's native check passed.** `project_candidate` has a single Ready exit (PP/retained_product.rs:3556), which ROOT read. So D19's second half stands as ruled.

I63 and I64 adopt 07b in their standing rounds.

**TypeScript, committed as `2d82351ccf`** (I64's single return, with no stop condition).
- ROOT verified the file hashes and the evidence, and that the corpus adopted is 07b's `729c12574a`.
- ROOT's own run: vitest 407/407, tsc 0.
- ROOT read each removed line: every one is replaced by an equal or stricter check (D20, D22, D27, D29). Nothing is weakened.
- I63 (Rust) is still in its round.

**Rust, committed as `0c81e09b09`** (I63's single return, with no stop condition).
- ROOT verified the file hashes and the evidence.
- ROOT's own run on the default toolchain: 47 passed, 0 failed.
- ROOT confirmed that the factored `reason_table` keeps every rule of the removed block, and that D19, D22 and D27–D29 are present. Nothing is weakened.

**The repair round D19–D30 is complete in all three readers on 07b.**

**D21 widened by a third indicator (from I63's remaining known difference).** A record's `verification` summary is set only by `verify_precision` (adaptive.rs:4333, the basis of D5a). So on an escalating failed verification record, a non-null verification summary is also evidence that the pass ran (G5 ATTEMPT). Rust already does this. Python and TypeScript add it, and I62 adds one shared pin. This is a small addition before the reviewers re-confirm, so they review one settled head.

**Snapshot 07c with Python, committed as `986088a466`.** ROOT's diff against 07b shows exactly one new mutation and nothing else changed. The corpus hash is `d33667719e`, and ROOT's own Python run gives 348 passed. I63 and I64 adopt 07c in their standing steps.

**TypeScript D21 and 07c, committed as `68113dbd70`.** ROOT verified the hashes and the evidence. ROOT's own run: vitest 409/409, tsc 0. The change only adds a rejection condition. Rust's adoption of 07c is pending.

## All readers on 07c; the real-receipt experiment's findings (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**READER `a894d9d0ba`:** all three readers pass snapshot 07c (15 cases, 254 mutations, 19 must-pass entries). ROOT's own runs: Python 348, Rust 47 (default toolchain), TypeScript vitest 409 with tsc 0. Rust's 07c change was its harness only. The tracked tree is clean.

**I61's experiment** (`R/I61/receipt_experiment_01/`, SHA256SUMS OK) emitted real producer receipts for RF-SKEW-T-CANT-OFF-122-r1e-04, sparse and dense, plus a preparation-refusal receipt. It checked them against READER `b36739112a`. This is wire-contract evidence only; it does not satisfy the public milestone.

**What the experiment established:**
- **Schema and hashes:** 0 schema violations. All four producer hashes (receipt, publication, source identity, preparation) agree with all three readers, and the invocation digest agrees with G8.
- **G0–G3:** the milestone receipts pass as emitted, in all three readers.
- **With labelled counterfactuals** (probe B removes one diagnostic; probe C sets the model `schema_version` to 0.2.0), both modes pass G0–G8 in all three readers with `needs_recompute`. Every reader's row classifications equal the producer's own certificate verdicts, row for row (98 rows sparse, 99 dense).
- **Host load:** about 1.3 s and about 20 MB peak RSS for one producer run.
- **Emitter bug E1, fixed in the experiment:** `absolute_verified` comes from the certificate's published-row verdicts.

**Contract tensions:**
- **T1, G4, blocks the main line.** For this case the actual ordinary route attempts the legacy source-block method, which fails at source closure (46,628 charged). It then emits `SOURCE_BLOCK_RECOVERY_UNAVAILABLE` naming the case.
  - C1's G4 row forbids a source-unavailable diagnostic naming a retained-selected case.
  - C2:160 says `legacy_source` "preserves original source failure disclosure", and that a W1 successor may carry `disposition: unavailable`.
  - The diagnostic is also consumed by the load-reference evidence readers (`loadReferenceEvidence.ts`, `load_reference.rs`, `load_reference_evidence.py`).
  
  **Not ruled yet.** It changes public disclosure semantics, possibly across routes. I61 analyses the options and their consumer effects first. If the chosen reading changes what users see, the owner decides.
- **T2, G8.** All three readers admit only model `schema_version` 0.2.0 or 0.3.0 (PY:1366, RS:3278, TS). The producer accepts 0.1.0 (for example PP pressure_runtime.rs:113) and certified the 0.1.0 milestone request in both modes. I61 found no basis for the rule in C1–C3. Until a basis is found, this is presumed a false reject of an emittable receipt. I61 traces where the rule came from before ROOT rules. Re-authoring the milestone request instead would change its digest, and that needs the owner.
- **T3, decided:**
  - Multi-case prepared support is wider-F2a scope, not the first milestone. The private driver handles one load case, and a one-case invocation whose case is unavailable has no successor publication.
  - The readers' unavailable branch (D9b, D19) therefore stays validated by the synthetic corpus only, until wider F2a. This is a recorded limit.
  - **Reader closure condition, amended:** the confirmation review passes, and the readers validate the real milestone receipts in both modes once T1 and T2 are resolved.

**Next:**
- The confirmation review (03) on `a894d9d0ba` runs now. It covers the D19–D30 dispositions; the T1/T2 delta gets a scoped check later (workflow §3).
- I61 analyses T1 and T2.
- The provisional readings A1–A4 and the producer gaps become inputs to the real serializer's brief.

**RV78 confirmation 03: PASS** (0 BLOCKING, 0 SHOULD-FIX, 2 NOTE).
- **Parity:** all 288 entries on 07c agree across the three readers.
- **New entries:** all 18 are contract-faithful.
- **Weakening:** nothing is weakened. The only removed test is the integral-float rule D25 retired.
- **Probes:** all 52 earlier probes give their ruled outcome.

The two NOTEs are optional by §6. They are taken up in the next corpus change, the T1/T2 round, rather than in a round of their own:
- N1: D19's Ready direction can become two shared pins.
- N2: `unavailable_attempt_under_source_error_cause` should get a self-consistent `source_decline`, so that a future consistency check cannot move it.

**RV81 confirmation 03: PASS** (0 BLOCKING, 0 SHOULD-FIX, 3 NOTE). Every confirm_02 finding is fixed, nothing is weakened, and 36 of 40 mutants are killed; the four survivors are equivalent, redundant or unreachable.

## T1 and T2: I61's analysis and the rulings (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

I61's analysis (`R/I61/contract_tensions_t1_t2/RETURN.md`) is verified: SHA256SUMS OK, no machine paths. ROOT checked its citations:
- `DESIGN_NUMERICS/DESIGN.md:1004` (D1 §5 item 11): "fresh solves no longer emit `SOURCE_BLOCK_RECOVERY_UNAVAILABLE` beside a selected case";
- the T2 rule first appears in READER `ae97b7d5c2` (the reader drafts frozen at the handoff), with no brief, return or contract basis;
- the producer treats model 0.1.0 and 0.2.0 on one branch (PP pressure_runtime.rs:113–118).

**D31 (T2), ruled.** G8 admits model `schema_version` ∈ {"0.1.0", "0.2.0", "0.3.0"}. 0.4.0 stays excluded (C1's G8 row, "no 0.4 extension"), and every other G8 check is unchanged.
- The previous rule had no basis, and it rejected an emittable receipt: the milestone request at 0.1.0, which the producer certifies in both modes.
- On this route 0.1.0 and 0.2.0 differ only in the version field, and in the invocation and receipt hashes that bind it.
- All three readers change. Shared pins: a 0.1.0 invocation that passes G8, and a 0.4.0 one that fails G8.
- The milestone request and its digest are unchanged; no owner decision is needed.

**T1, recommended and put to the owner.** Option (a): the successor facade omits the legacy `SOURCE_BLOCK_RECOVERY_UNAVAILABLE` diagnostic on a retained-selected case. The case's `legacy_source` becomes `{disposition: "unavailable", diagnostic_ref: null, work_ref: k}`, and `legacy_source_work[k]` carries the actual WorkReport.
- **This implements the selected design** (D1 §5 item 11). It agrees with C1's G4 row and is compatible with C2:160, whose `diagnostic_ref` is nullable. No reader rule is relaxed.
- **What changes:** a producer obligation for the serializer, plus one optional shared pin.
- **Options rejected:** (b), amending G4, would reverse the design and show "selected" beside "did not produce a selected response". (c), routing, would change bytes the coexistence rule (D-15) and the fallback (C1 §2) protect.
- **The tension arose** because F2a keeps the exact-block method running first, so the ordinary route emits the diagnostic before W1 runs. The design did not foresee that.
- **Why it goes to the owner:** on a successor result the diagnostics panel no longer shows the legacy "did not produce a selected response" row, and the legacy attempt moves into the receipt. ROOT recommends (a) and is asking the owner to confirm. The readers are unaffected either way.

**RV79 confirmation 03: FAIL** (1 BLOCKING, 0 SHOULD-FIX, 4 NOTE). All four confirm_02 findings are fixed, and all 48 of RV79's probes give their ruled outcome. The BLOCKING finding, E1, is a consequence of ROOT's own D25.

**E1, confirmed by ROOT.** D25 made readers accept integral-valued numbers (`0.0` is `0`), but Python still guards four index sites with `type(x) is int` (PY:1572, 1578, 1606, 1617), and its G0 limits likewise (PY:1561). A forged `source_identity_sha256` on a selected case with `source_ref: 0.0` therefore passes every gate in Python. The G5 recheck that once caught it was removed as dead under D15.

ROOT also checked Rust, for RV79's N-f:
- Rust's `uint()` is value-based (RS:243 and `uint`);
- but its G0 checks use `is_u64`/`as_u64` (RS:478, 492), so `receipt_version: 1.0` or a float-written limit fails G0 in Rust only.

The three readers therefore treat integral floats three different ways.

**D32, D25 made uniform.** Wherever a reader requires an integer (U, an index or reference, a version, a limit or a counter), it tests the numeric **value**: finite, integral, within range, and not −0. It never tests the host language's integer type.
- **Python:** normalizes integral-valued numbers to `int` once, immediately after G2, or uses value tests at every integer site. Either way, the five sites above must behave as for `int`. Reader-local tests for each.
- **Rust:** replaces the `is_u64`/`as_u64` uses (RS:478, 492 and any others) with `uint()`.
- **TypeScript:** confirms its value-based tests (`Number.isSafeInteger`) at every integer site.
- **The Python harness** indexes with integral values (RV79-N-e).
- **Shared pins:**
  - a must-pass entry whose integer fields and references are written as integral floats;
  - the forged-source-identity case with `source_ref: 0.0`, expected G1.

RV79's other notes are carried: N-a (the harness rehashes with the reader's own functions; RV78's independent rehash covers this) and N-b (deferred bases).

**RV80 confirmation 03: PASS** (0 BLOCKING, 0 SHOULD-FIX, 3 NOTE). All four confirm_02 findings are fixed as D27–D30 state. RV80 compared the factored `reason_table` with the inline block it replaced and found them identical. 38 of 44 mutants are killed.

## Round 03 closed; the 07d repair round (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**Round 03:** RV78, RV80 and RV81 PASS; RV79 FAIL, on E1 only, which comes from D25 and is ruled as D32.

**D33 (RV80-N1).** A `verification_estimate` reason must name a Force or Moment layout row. The native verification estimate is computed only for those kinds (FK/retained/verify.rs:880), so an estimate rejection naming a translation or rotation row cannot be emitted. G5 ATTEMPT; shared pin from RV80's PR16. `charge` is not restricted, since it may natively name displacement rows.

**The 07d round, under the same standing assignments:**
- **The shared corpus (I62):**
  - D31 pins: a 0.1.0 invocation passes G8, a 0.4.0 one fails it;
  - D32 pins: a must-pass entry written with integral-float integers and references, and the forged source identity with `source_ref: 0.0`, expected G1;
  - D33's pin;
  - RV78-N1: D19's Ready direction as two shared negatives, under `facade_failure` and under a `prepared_product_failure` that names a Ready attempt;
  - RV78-N2: a self-consistent `source_decline` in `unavailable_attempt_under_source_error_cause`;
  - the D32 harness change: indexing by integral value.
- **Python (I62):** D31, D32 and D33.
- **Rust (I63):** D31; D32 (replace `is_u64`/`as_u64`, RS:478, 492 and any others); D33; a reader-local test for D21's last-slot case (RV80-N2); then adopt 07d.
- **TypeScript (I64):** D31; D32 (confirm value tests at every integer site); D33; then adopt 07d.

**After this round:** a scoped check of the 07d delta by the round-03 reviewers (workflow §3). Then I61 reruns the real receipts on the accepted head. T1 still awaits the owner; it binds the producer serializer, not the readers.

## T1 confirmed by the owner (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**The owner's message, verbatim:** "I confirm option (a) for T1".

**T1 is decided as option (a):**
- On a retained-selected case, the successor publication omits the legacy `SOURCE_BLOCK_RECOVERY_UNAVAILABLE` diagnostic naming that case.
- The case's ordinary `legacy_source` becomes `{disposition: "unavailable", diagnostic_ref: null, work_ref: k}`. `legacy_source_work[k]` carries the actual WorkReport (stage, helper_stage, charged, rejected, limit, settlement `booked`).
- `diagnostic_refs` no longer lists the omitted diagnostic.
- Unselected cases and the fallback publication keep today's bytes.

This implements the selected design (DESIGN_NUMERICS/DESIGN.md:1004, D1 §5 item 11).

**Effects:**
- **The producer serializer** is bound by this; it is an input to the serializer brief.
- **The readers** need no change. G4 and the existing `legacy_source` reference checks (O4, D6d) already enforce it.
- **The user:** on a successor result, the diagnostics panel shows "retained precision selected" without the legacy "did not produce a selected response" row.

**Snapshot 07d with Python, committed as `2af4a5dc50`.**
- **ROOT's diff against 07c:** 5 mutations and 2 must-pass entries added. One entry changed, `unavailable_attempt_under_source_error_cause`, made self-consistent (RV78-N2) with its expectation unchanged. Nothing removed.
- **Totals:** 15 cases, 259 mutations, 21 must-pass entries.
- **Corpus hash:** `12da125d9d`.
- **ROOT's own Python run:** 358 passed.
- **Weakening:** ROOT read the removed Python lines; each type test is replaced by the D32 value test.

I63 and I64 adopt 07d in their standing rounds.

**Rust 07d, committed as `265f764fa4`.** ROOT verified the hashes and the evidence, and ran 53 passed on the default toolchain. The three removed lines are the two G0 type tests D32 replaced and the old version rule D31 replaced. `uint()` still rejects booleans. TypeScript's 07d round is pending.

**TypeScript 07d, committed as `abcb16fd27`.** ROOT verified the hashes and the evidence; vitest 419/419, tsc 0. The only removed line is the old 0.2.0/0.3.0 rule that D31 replaced.

**All three readers pass snapshot 07d on READER `abcb16fd27`** (15 cases, 259 mutations, 21 must-pass entries). ROOT's own runs: Python 358, Rust 53, TypeScript 419. The tracked tree is clean.

**Next, in parallel:**
- **Confirmation round 04,** scoped to the 07d delta (D31–D33, D32's normalization, the new entries) by RV78–RV81.
- **I61 reruns the real-receipt experiment** on `abcb16fd27`, with no counterfactuals, now that T1 (owner-confirmed option a, emitted by the experiment's emitter) and T2 (D31) are resolved.

## The real milestone receipts pass all three readers (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

I61's second experiment (`R/I61/receipt_experiment_02/`, SHA256SUMS OK, no machine paths) ran on READER `abcb16fd27` and NUM `83732c5677`. It applied no counterfactual: T1 option (a) is emitted as the owner confirmed it, and the request is unchanged at model 0.1.0.

**The result:** the real receipts for RF-SKEW-T-CANT-OFF-122-r1e-04 pass G0–G8 in Python, Rust and TypeScript, in both the sparse and the dense mode, with standing `needs_recompute`.
- **Classification parity:** the three readers' classifications are identical, and equal the producer's certificate verdicts row for row: 98/98 sparse, 99/99 dense.
- **Repeatability:** a second producer run gave byte-identical receipts; one run takes about 1.5 s at about 20.5 MB.

**ROOT's own independent check.** Not using I61's harness, ROOT called the Python reader at READER `abcb16fd27` directly on both emitted receipts:
- each is selected, `needs_recompute`, and invocation-bound;
- the classes are 69 absolute-verified, 25 relative-verified, 3 input-derived, and 1 non-quantity sparse or 2 dense;
- `legacy_source` is `{unavailable, null, 0}` with `legacy_source_work[0]` carrying the 46,628-unit WorkReport;
- no `SOURCE_BLOCK_RECOVERY_UNAVAILABLE` is present;
- the request's model `schema_version` is 0.1.0.

**This meets the real-receipt half of the reader closure condition.** It is wire-contract evidence through the test-only prepared driver. **It is not the public milestone,** which still needs the real serializer, the captured facade, permit/M and RV77-N4's binding.

**Carried to the serializer brief:**
- the producer gaps G-a to G-k;
- the assumptions A1, A2 and A4;
- T1's emission;
- the new gap G-l: the typed legacy RecoveryFailure and its WorkReport must be captured at PP/lib.rs:3747–3760. The experiment read them back from diagnostic text, which C2 forbids for the real serializer.

**Remaining before reader acceptance:** confirmation round 04 (RV78–RV81), now running.

**RV78 confirmation 04: PASS** (0 BLOCKING, 0 SHOULD-FIX, 1 NOTE).
- **Parity:** all 295 entries on 07d agree across the three readers and with the corpus.
- **The integral-float must-pass entry:** its four hashes are byte-equal to the integer-written base.
- **New entries:** all 8 are new or changed, and all are contract-faithful.
- **Probes:** all 55 earlier probes and six integral-value edge probes give their ruled outcome. RV78's N1 and N2 are fixed.

**N1, latent harness rehash differences.** No 07d entry triggers any of them:
- Python's `int()` truncates and accepts booleans;
- Rust tests strictly;
- TypeScript indexes directly.

By §6 this is not an acceptance condition. It is recorded for the next format change: the snapshot format will state the rehash indexing rule (strict integral value), and all harnesses will align to it.

**RV81 confirmation 04: PASS** (0 BLOCKING, 0 SHOULD-FIX, 3 NOTE). D31, D32 and D33 are implemented as ruled, and nothing is weakened.
- **D32:** checked across all 15 cases with every integer rewritten as `7.0` and as `7e0`. −0 and booleans are still rejected, and float-written references resolve.
- **Mutants:** 39 of 47 killed.
- **Optional (NOTE 1):** D33 is pinned only with a translation row, so the mutants admitting a rotation estimate or refusing a moment estimate survive. The reader is correct on both by probe. A rotation pin and a moment control are added in the next corpus change.
- **NOTE 2:** −0 rejection is backed up twice, in `uint` and in the G2 encoding check, and the pair is pinned.

**RV79 confirmation 04: PASS** (0 BLOCKING, 1 SHOULD-FIX, 3 NOTE).
- **E1 is fixed by D32,** checked with RV79's own probes: the forged source identity behind `0.0`, the float `attempt_ref`, and the D23 and coverage float refs all fail at their ruled gates.
- **Booleans and −0:** booleans fail G0 or G1, and −0 fails G2 in counter and index fields.
- **Normalization:** it cannot truncate, because G1 and G2 have already proved every receipt number integral.
- **Weakening:** nothing is weakened.
- **Mutants:** 21 of 29 killed.

**S1 (SHOULD-FIX, tests only).** No test kills M29 (`_integral` truncating non-integral floats). Three shared G0 pins are added: `receipt_version: 1.5`, `case_limit: 20000000000.5` and `invocation_limit: 60000000000.5`.

**D34, −0 everywhere (RV79-N1).** A JSON number equal to −0 anywhere in the receipt fails G2 ENCODING. That includes the integer fields the schema writes as enum or const values (`G5aError.quantity_kind`, `source_decline.constructor_counts.directional_springs`).
- **Basis:** C1 §4 ("Nonnegative quantities require canonical +0, never negative zero") and C1's G2 row ("no -0 counter"); D32's "not −0".
- Canonical JCS writes 0, so no emitter produces −0. Accepting it would admit a non-canonical spelling.
- All readers confirm or apply it, with reader-local tests: no base carries those two fields.

**The 07e round waits for RV80's report,** so that every round-04 item lands together:
- S1's three G0 pins;
- D34;
- RV81-N1's D33 kind-set pins (a rotation estimate fails, a moment estimate passes);
- RV78-N1's rehash indexing rule, written into the format and aligned across the harnesses.

**RV80 confirmation 04: PASS** (0 BLOCKING, 0 SHOULD-FIX, 2 NOTE). The probing went deep:
- `integral_receipt` touches only receipt numbers;
- −0 and booleans are still rejected;
- out-of-range numbers fail at G1 before normalization runs;
- 44 of 52 mutants are killed.

Its notes are optional and recorded: N1, the receipt-only scope of `integral_receipt` is unpinned; N2, the defence-in-depth guards stay through any later reordering of the gates.

## Round 04 closed; 07e is the last repair round before acceptance (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**Round 04:** all four reviewers PASS. The real milestone receipts pass all three readers on `abcb16fd27`.

**What remains, as ruled:**
- RV79-S1, three G0 pins;
- D34, −0 rejected everywhere at G2;
- RV81-N1, the D33 kind-set: a rotation-row estimate fails, and a moment-row estimate passes as a must-pass entry;
- RV78-N1: the snapshot format states the rehash indexing rule (strict integral value; booleans and non-integral values are not indexes), and all three harnesses align to it.

**Assignments,** standing, returning once:
- I62: the corpus (07e), the format rule, Python D34 and its harness;
- I63: Rust D34 and its harness, then 07e;
- I64: TypeScript D34 and its harness, then 07e.

**The final check is scoped (workflow §3):**
- RV79 confirms S1 and D34 in Python, as the reviewer who raised them;
- RV78 runs parity on 07e and probes D34 in all three readers.

**The readers are accepted when that check passes.**

**Snapshot 07e with Python, committed as `b890ce6c30`.** ROOT's diff against 07d shows only additions (4 mutations, 1 must-pass entry), with nothing changed or removed. Totals: 15 cases, 263 mutations, 22 must-pass entries. ROOT's Python run gives 365 passed. The removed Python lines are the harness's `int()` indexing, replaced by the strict rule. I63 and I64 adopt 07e.
[Correction, 2026-10-03: the one removed line in the Python **reader** is its G2 call (`_encoding` then `_normalize_integrals`). It is replaced by the same call with D34's −0 check between the two; ROOT checked the replacement. The harness's `int()` indexing was replaced separately, in the test file.]

**Rust 07e, committed as `2bef5062f7`.** ROOT verified the hashes and the evidence, and ran 56 passed on the default toolchain. D34 had to be applied, not just confirmed: −0 in the enum/const fields previously reached G5. Rust now has a single `g2()` that rejects −0 anywhere before D32's normalization. TypeScript's 07e round is pending.

**TypeScript 07e, committed as `63355a91d2`.** ROOT verified the hashes and the evidence; vitest 428/428, tsc 0. ROOT read the G1 change: the const and enum comparison maps only −0 to 0, which is the one JSON value `Object.is` distinguishes, so nothing else is newly admitted. `negativeZeroFree` then rejects it at G2 over the whole receipt.

**All three readers pass snapshot 07e on READER `63355a91d2`** (15 cases, 263 mutations, 22 must-pass entries). ROOT's own runs: Python 365, Rust 56, TypeScript 428. The tracked tree is clean.

**The final scoped check (workflow §3)** is done by the reviewer of each change:
- RV79: S1 and D34 in Python;
- RV80: Rust's `g2()` refactor and D34, including the transport-metadata path;
- RV81: the TypeScript G1/G2 change and D34;
- RV78: parity on 07e, D34 probes in all three readers, and the format rule across the harnesses.

**The readers are accepted when all four pass.**

**RV78 final check (confirm 05): the four scoped items pass.**
- **Parity:** all 300 entries on 07e agree across the three readers.
- **D34:** confirmed in all three readers.
- **The rehash format rule:** followed by all three harnesses.
- **New entries:** all 5 are faithful.

Its control probes also found **2 SHOULD-FIX defects outside the delta**, both on unavailable attempts. Neither can reach eligibility.

**D35, product-attempt error versus stage outcome (RV78-S1, S2).** After certification the producer always enters and checks both the Observables and the G5a stages. It then returns `Observable` if the observables check failed, else `G5a` if the G5a check failed, else `Numeric` (PP/retained_product.rs:3529–3543, which ROOT read; C3:279–284). So:
- an `observable` error requires the observables check failed;
- a `g5a` error requires observables passed and the G5a check failed;
- a `numeric` error requires both stages entered and both checks passed.

The code is G5 PRODUCT_ATTEMPT.
- Python aligns S1 (as TS:737–738 already does); all three readers apply S2.
- Shared pins: RV78's Y1, Y2 and Y4. Y6, the consistent shape, stays passing.

**D36, a finite closure rule for the reader acceptance (workflow §6).** Every review round since 01 has found new defects by probing further into input space the real producer cannot yet emit. The agreed acceptance conditions are:
- (a) the confirmation findings are repaired;
- (b) the real milestone receipts pass all three readers. This is met.

From here, findings are triaged as follows:
- **Before acceptance:** a BLOCKING finding, or any finding that could change a statement's eligibility or a selected case's standing.
- **Tracked, not gating:** a finding that affects only unavailable or refused paths and cannot change eligibility. It is repaired in the next reader round, on the integration branch after fan-in.

D35 is repaired now, because the round is small and already scoped. But the check of D35 is scoped to D35 alone (RV78 for parity, RV79 for Python). Any new finding from that check is triaged under D36 rather than starting another round.

**RV80 final check (confirm 05): PASS** (0 BLOCKING, 0 SHOULD-FIX, 2 NOTE). D34 works in `validate` (with and without an invocation) and in `validate_transport_metadata`, on both enum/const fields and on U fields. The `g2()` refactor drops and weakens nothing.

Both NOTEs fall under D36's "tracked, not gating":
- N1: D34 on the transport path is unpinned (M56). Add a transport-path call to the D34 test in the next round.
- N2: `integral_receipt`'s receipt-only scope is unpinned (M50).

I63 may add the N1 test in the D35 round, at no extra cost.

**RV81 final check (confirm 05): PASS** (0 BLOCKING, 0 SHOULD-FIX, 3 NOTE).
- **D34:** across all 15 bases, every one of 9,114 zero positions written as −0 fails G2.
- **The G1 change admits nothing new:** a before/after table over the 27 numeric const/enum members shows only the two −0 cases moving, from G1 to G2.
- **D33's kind-set pins:** they kill R26 and R27.

The NOTEs are tracked under D36:
- R35, the −0 mapping widened to tiny values, is unpinned. The reader is correct.
- −0 at an enum position where 0 is invalid, such as `precision`, fails at G1 by value semantics.

**RV79 final check (confirm 05): its three scoped items pass** (S1, D34, and the diff); nothing is weakened. It reports one new finding, **X1**, outside the scope and present at every head reviewed. RV79 labelled it BLOCKING by the B1c/C1 precedent.

**X1 and D35 are one relation.** Python checks an unavailable attempt's error kind against its stage record in one direction only (`_g5_typed`, PY:854–872). So it accepts errors that contradict the stages: `g5a` with G5a not entered; `observable` with observables not entered; `proof` with the certificate passed; `values` with values completed; `numeric` with observables and G5a not entered. D35 already covers the last three in part.

**Classification under D36:** not gating. X1 affects unavailable attempts only and cannot change eligibility or a selected case's standing. It is repaired now anyway, because it is the same relation, in the same files, as the D35 round already under way. That means one disposition, not two.

**D37, D35 widened.** For every product-attempt error kind (`preparation`, `native`, `capture`, `proof`, `values`, `abandoned`, `numeric`, `observable`, `g5a`), the error must agree with the stage record **in both directions**:
- the kind is one the first failed or terminal stage can produce;
- every stage the kind presupposes as entered, completed or passed is recorded so;
- the code is G5 PRODUCT_ATTEMPT, in class 3 (typed checks).

**Basis:** the native sequence in PP/retained_product.rs:3469–3543, which I62 tabulates exactly in its return; S06 §1, "Existing stage consistency still applies"; D4d and D35.

**Who does what:**
- All three readers implement or confirm D37.
- Shared pins: RV78's Y1, Y2 and Y4, and RV79's five X1 probes on F′. Y6, the consistent shape, stays passing.
- I63 also adds RV80-N1's transport-path D34 test.

**The check of this round is scoped to D37:** RV78 for parity and probes in all three readers, RV79 for Python. New findings from it are triaged under D36.

**Snapshot 07f with Python, committed as `fd76145542`.**
- **ROOT's diff against 07e:** 5 mutations added (RV79's X1 probes); nothing changed or removed. Totals: 15 cases, 268 mutations, 22 must-pass entries.
- **ROOT's Python run:** 371 passed.
- **The removed Python lines:** the old one-direction mapping, replaced by the full stage-record table (RETURN_07F).
- **RV78's Y1, Y2 and Y4** are byte-identical to three of the X1 pins, so they are pinned once.

**I63 handed back early** (a forced hand-off) with D37 and the transport test done in its working tree but not reconciled with I62's published table, and not run on 07f. It is resumed to finish; a successor takes over from its written state if needed. I64's round continues.

**TypeScript D37 and 07f, committed as `624507c71b`.** ROOT verified the hashes and the evidence; vitest 436/436, tsc 0. The reader's diff removes no line. Its table matches I62's row for row. Rust's finish is pending.

**Rust D37 and 07f, committed as `85905e95e9`.** ROOT verified the hashes and the evidence, and ran 58 passed on the default toolchain. The removed block is the old one-direction P9 mapping, replaced by `error_stages`, which matches I62's table on all 16 rows and is stricter. The D34 transport test kills M56.

**All three readers pass snapshot 07f on READER `85905e95e9`** (15 cases, 268 mutations, 22 must-pass entries). ROOT's own runs: Python 371, Rust 58, TypeScript 436. The tracked tree is clean.

**Tracked under D36, not gating (from I63):** I62's table includes `capture` (a), a `solve_native` failure before any Run is recorded (PP:3279–3285). Rust and Python require a Run whenever the native stage was entered (Rust's `g5_products`; PY:833–836), so they would reject that record. TypeScript's table includes the record; whether its Run rule admits it is unconfirmed. This concerns unavailable paths only. It needs a ruling on the Run representation for an early prepared-solve failure, taken in the next reader round after fan-in, alongside the producer serializer, which decides what is emitted there.

**The D37-scoped check is dispatched:**
- RV78: parity on 07f, D37 probes in all three readers, and the capture (a) record across readers;
- RV79: D37 in Python.

New findings are triaged under D36.

**RV78 D37-scoped check (confirm 06): PASS** (0 BLOCKING, 0 SHOULD-FIX, 0 NOTE).
- **Parity:** all 305 entries on 07f agree across the three readers.
- **D37 probes:** all 17 gated probes give their D37 outcome in all three readers. Every error kind has a rejected inconsistent record, and every kind except `native` has an accepted consistent record (no base has a nonselected Run; D30).
- **Weakening:** none; the Python and Rust tables are strictly stronger.
- **`capture` (a):** all three readers reject it at G5 PRODUCT_ATTEMPT. It stays tracked under D36. All three readers agree, so no parity gap remains on it.

RV79's D37 check is pending.

## The F2a readers accepted and fanned in (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

**RV79 D37-scoped check (confirm 06): PASS** (0 BLOCKING, 0 SHOULD-FIX, 2 NOTE). RV79 encoded the native sequence independently and compared it with Python on 250 error-kind × stage-record pairs: 0 mismatches. Nothing is weakened. NOTE N1, tracked under D36, is that the D37 test takes its expected values from the reader's own table, so M35 and M37 survive. The next reader round writes the expected table into the test independently.

**Both acceptance conditions are met:**
- (a) every confirmation finding is repaired and confirmed (rounds 01–06; D1–D37);
- (b) the real milestone receipts pass all three readers in both modes (I61's experiment 02, with ROOT's independent Python check).

**Accepted:** the three retained-precision readers at READER `85905e95e9`, with their tests, the retained-precision schema and the shared corpus (snapshot 07f):
- Python `P/core/analysis_runs/retained_precision.py`;
- Rust `P/core/reporting/result_export/src/retained_precision.rs`;
- TypeScript `P/apps/desktop/src/features/results/retainedPrecision.ts`.

**Not accepted by this:**
- reader eligibility and public activation. The completeness holds stay false until the producer path qualifies (the handoff constraint);
- **two artefacts the reader branch carries that no reviewer covered:**
  - the semantic-contract table fixture `semantic_contract_v0_3_preview_physics_retained_1.json`, bound by hash at G0;
  - the `results.v0.3.schema.yaml` successor branch (149 lines).
  
  Both came with the reader drafts frozen at the handoff (`ae97b7d5c2`). RV78's first review said it did not review the YAML branch. A scoped review of both is dispatched to RV78, and findings are repaired on NUM.

**Fan-in:** the reader branch was merged into NUM as `c15e64b756`, with no rebase and no conflicting file.
- All 13 merged files are byte-identical to READER `85905e95e9`.
- ROOT's runs on NUM: Python 371, Rust 58 (default toolchain). TypeScript is byte-identical to its verified head (436/436, tsc 0); NUM has no node_modules or WASM assets to rerun it in place.

**Tracked for the next reader round (D36):**
- `capture` (a)'s Run representation, decided together with the serializer;
- RV79-N1 (an independent expected table in the D37 test);
- RV80-N2 (`integral_receipt`'s scope pin);
- RV81 R35 (done);
- the deferred-base survivors.

**This closes handoff step 3.** Next is step 4: memory/profile/M and the producer receipt transaction. Its serializer brief carries the producer gaps G-a to G-l, the assumptions A1, A2 and A4, T1's emission, D6a's exact ordinary list, D9b's explicit null, RV77-N4's owner binding and the deferred producer-solved witnesses.

**RV78 on the carried artefacts: PASS** (0 BLOCKING, 1 SHOULD-FIX, 4 NOTE; none gating under D36).
- **The table:** it differs from the inherited one in exactly 8 places, each grounded in C1 or C3: the contract id and profile, the inherited raw-file hash, and five added members, including the definition H. All 73 rows and the inherited policies are unchanged.
- **The YAML branch:** it is the preview-physics-1 branch plus a required closed `retained_precision`. The seven existing branches now forbid that member, so none is loosened. RV78 ran 26 probes; the schema test passes 12/12.

The two artefacts are therefore accepted with the readers.

**Routed:**
- **S1 → the carrier work (handoff step 5, wider F2a):** C1:162 requires successor branches in the AnalysisRun and stress-neutral carrier schemas, and neither exists. The documents fail closed, and the T6 export refusal stands.
- **N3 → the carrier work:** the successor does not constrain the derivative's absolute/not_covered disclosures.
- **N1 and N2 → the next reader round:** the table does not bind the policies and limits the readers enforce as G0 constants, and RV78's probes become schema tests.
- **N4:** a re-serialized `§`, with the same JSON value; recorded.

## Step 4 planned: decisions and dispatch (ROOT, 2026-10-03 UTC)

I61's plan (`R/I61/step4_plan_01/PLAN.md`, SHA256SUMS OK, no machine paths) gives the route to the first public milestone. The sequence is:
- **U1** (the real serializer) with **U2** (RV77-N4's owner binding);
- **U3** (facade capture behind the permit gate);
- **U4** (the memory profile and permit; the critical path, started now);
- **U5** (the reference comparison) and **U6** (carriers and standing);
- **U7** (eligibility switch-on);
- **U9** (gates and the product PR).

U8, the deferred witnesses, follows the milestone. The estimate is about 57–91 agent-hours plus 20–30 hours of review, and elapsed time is set by U4.

**Decisions** (I61's numbering):
1. **A1:** `retained_state_sha256` is the raw SHA256 of the retained-state bytes, by C1 §3's kernel-bytes rule and C2:91's `ledger_sha256` convention. It is a producer attestation; no reader recomputes it.
2. **A2, D6a's exact list:** each case's ordinary `diagnostic_refs` lists exactly the diagnostics whose `affected_refs` name that case, once each, in envelope order. It excludes the `RETAINED_PRECISION_*` diagnostics and the legacy disclosure omitted under T1 (a). Invocation-level diagnostics are attributed to no case.
3. **A4:** closed by the fan-in, together with RV78's carried-artefact review.
4. **D38, the Run representation.** A Run exists if and only if a kernel schedule ran (C1:103: "`run:null` is legal only when no kernel schedule ran"; C3:167; RR:7262–7264). An early prepared-solve failure before any kernel schedule carries `run: null`, `run_ref: null` and a `capture` error with the actual cause. The readers' stricter rule ("native entered ⇒ Run") is relaxed to D38 in the next reader round. This is a ruled change, pinned there once the serializer emits such a receipt; it is not a silent weakening.
5. **Precommit validation:** PP takes a path dependency on `result_export` and runs the Rust reader before transfer (I51's design). There is no cycle; ROOT checked that `result_export` does not depend on `product_physics`.
6. **The first admission domain:** one load case, no combinations, the preview family, no pressure, capped counts. M is selected after U4 qualifies, within the provisional 3.75 GiB target.
7. **Experiment 03's test permit** is a stub only in the disposable archive. Maintained code keeps its "no test values" rule.
8. **The milestone reference:** I50's named oracle.
9. **Owner-held:** stating M as a supported-machine figure. None is needed before U4 returns.

**Dispatch:**
- **I61:** experiment 03 (the early end-to-end slice through the actual facade function, with eligibility off), then U1 and U2.
- **I65 (new):** U4 grant 1, the derivation plan, under `BRIEFS/I65_U4_MEMORY_PROFILE.md`.

The next unused IDs are I66 and RV82.

## Experiment 03: the real facade produces the same certified receipt (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

I61's experiment 03 (`R/I61/receipt_experiment_03/`, SHA256SUMS OK, no machine paths) ran in a disposable archive. It called the actual facade function `run_linear_static_preview_value_with_retained_direct` on the unchanged 0.1.0 milestone request, in both modes. Capture was installed in the single ordinary run behind a test-only permit stub (decision 7); the maintained `retained_memory.rs` is untouched and still refuses.

**The result:**
- All three accepted readers at NUM pass G0–G8 with eligibility off. Classification parity is 98/98 and 99/99.
- The receipts are **byte-identical** to experiment 02's (the private driver). ROOT compared the `retained_precision` members itself: equal in both modes, with receipt hashes `2c8cee1a84…` (sparse) and `dbcc7dd03e…` (dense).
- The G-l typed capture equals the values experiment 02 parsed from text.
- The ordinary-byte controls A, B and B′ hold in both modes, and reruns are deterministic.
- The only PP `--lib` failure is the known Mac platform failure t13, which fails the same way at base.

**This retires the phase's main premise:** the facade's single ordinary run yields the private driver's certified receipt. The design inputs D-a to D-d go to U3.

**D39, the `legacy_source` disposition mapping (R-U1-1).** C2:160 names four dispositions without producer sites. They map to the PP/lib.rs:3662–3769 branches as follows:

| Producer branch | Disposition |
|---|---|
| `!source_eligible` | `not_eligible` |
| `!needs_source_recovery` | `not_required` |
| a formation-guard or range-formation decline (WorkReport 0/0/0) | `declined_without_attempt` |
| an actual attempt that failed | `unavailable` |
| `Ok(recovery)` | the coexistence bypass: exact-block selected, W1 not attempted (D-15), so no successor |

Experiment 02's merging of the first two rows is corrected in U1.

**Stage 2 (U1 with U2) is confirmed** under I61's grant-1 proposal: its write fence, its deliverable (a private, production-unreachable serializer), protected byte controls 1–5, mutants, and a cost of about 6–8 hours plus about 3 hours of joint review.
- `result_export` may be added as a **dev-dependency** for U1's tests. The runtime path dependency for precommit validation (decision 5) belongs to U3.
- G-i and D38 go to U1 grant 2.

## U4 plan: decisions, and two questions for the owner (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

I65's U4 plan (`R/I65/u4_plan_01/PLAN.md`, SHA256SUMS OK, no machine paths) maps 24 terms:
- 2 priced, 12 partial, 2 symbolic, 5 missing;
- 1 out of domain (native context);
- 1 non-claim (RSS, allocator overhead and concurrency);
- 1 missing and **stopped: stack (T20).**

Every term except stack has a closing route inside a bounded first domain.

**Native context, tail and backing close by construction.** No admitted invocation has a native owner: the Tauri app calls only the ordinary wrapper (apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/lib.rs:1562, 1696), an existing source test asserts it never calls the retained entries (PP/tests/retained_precision_admission.rs:217–222), `Entry` has only Direct and Headless, and `CapturePermit` is `pub(super)`. Native W1 qualification stays held, and I53/RV70's external warrant is unchanged.

**The estimate grows** to about 33–49 hours of authoring plus 11–15 hours of review, across grants G2–G6. The precommit reader, the nested census, build identity and stack account for the increase over I61's figure.

**Ruled by ROOT:**
- **D-1:** the domain is the Direct caller, one load case, no combinations or components, the preview family, no pressure, straight members, rigid and scalar-spring supports, nodal loads only and the default basis. The build is aarch64 with rustc 1.97.1 and the PP lock. The caps are as proposed: 32 nodes, members and supports; 192 restraints, springs and loads; 128-byte identifiers; census depth 16 and the existing 16,384-value limit. I51's gates G-A, G-B and G-C stay, and anything outside goes to the ordinary path.
- **D-2:** Direct only for the milestone; Headless later.
- **D-5:** U4 owns `retained_memory.rs` and U3 owns the dispatch. I61 is the single integration owner for any `PP/lib.rs` edit.
- **D-8:** deep legacy-exact is derived under the existing exact-boundary limits.
- **D-9:** the caps are confirmed for the milestone and the L = 0 base. The Ceiling witness (U8, post-milestone) may revisit them.
- **Design-to-budget for G4** is adopted. U4 sets budgets for the precommit reader and transfer, and U3 must meet them. This decouples U4 from U3's freeze.
- **D-4 (the C1 §2 no-wrap reconciliation)** is drafted by I65 in G2 with citations, and ROOT rules on it at G2's return.
- **D-7:** at G6, M is set as the per-invocation W1 admission threshold on requested and moving heap bytes, within the provisional 3.75 GiB target (RR:4938). It makes no RSS, stack, concurrency or machine claim. A supported-machine reading stays owner-held.

**Put to the owner:**
- **D-3, the stack evidence standard** (the stop item). The options are:
  - S1: a reserved-stack thread, plus a structural recursion bound from source, plus a measured witness with margin;
  - S2: a frame census from the build's disassembly, which needs a new analysis script, that is, host tooling;
  - S3: hold the permit.
  
  It is the owner's choice because it sets what counts as qualified for a priced term, against the handoff's "no permit on symbolic or partially priced terms", and S2 needs host tooling.
- **D-6, build-identity enforcement.** The options are:
  - (a) a PP build script records the rustc identity, and any mismatch marks the profile Stale. That fails closed to the ordinary path. It is a new in-product guard, so the owner's "no new guards" constraint applies;
  - (b) gate-bound qualification only.

**Dispatch:** U4 G2 (the domain, build binding and residual closure; records only) goes ahead now. G2–G4 do not depend on D-3. G5 cannot enable a permit until D-3 is resolved.

## The owner decides D-3 and D-6 (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

The owner answered ROOT's two structured questions. The selections, verbatim:
- **D-3, stack:** "S1: reserved stack + witness (Recommended)".
- **D-6, build identity:** "(a) Fail-closed build check (Recommended)".

**D-3 = S1.** The retained entry runs on a thread with an explicitly reserved stack. Stack is qualified by three things together: a structural recursion bound from source; the reserved size, which is the priced figure; and a witness test at a stated fraction of the reservation, with margin. No new host tooling.
- The reserved stack is a priced term of the profile. The witness is recorded as measured evidence, not a proof.
- The qualification record states that standard explicitly.

**D-6 = (a).** A PP build script records the compiler identity. Any mismatch with the qualified build marks the profile `Stale`, so the permit is refused and the code falls back to the unchanged ordinary path.
- The owner chose this in-product guard explicitly; it fails closed.
- Compile-time layout witnesses and the reviewed consumer locks are added alongside, as I65's plan proposes.

U4 proceeds: G2 records the build identity facts for D-6, and stack moves into the G3 and G5 sequence under S1.

## Checked work custody in U1 (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**The finding crosses owners.** It comes from I65's D-4 draft, which is still in progress (`R/I65/u4_g2_01/D4_RECONCILIATION.md` §3, item 1), and it affects I61's U1 grant 1, also in progress. Workflow §5 calls for one disposition before any return relies on it.

**ROOT checked the finding itself** against I61's working file `PP/src/retained_wire.rs` (read-only) and FK at base `43a6368c21`:
- the projection emits `AttemptRecord::{shared_work, stop_rule_work, verification_work, verification_shared_work}` and the `StageWork` slots raw;
- it compares against `InvocationMeter::charged()`.

These fields are written through `WorkTotal::legacy_saturated()` (FK/structural/retained/work.rs; `StageWork::set`). They also bypass the record's `work_status` latch, which the `checked_*` accessors join (FK adaptive.rs :2774–2815). A record with a latched fault could therefore be projected as if exact. The milestone receipt is unaffected, because every value there is exact; this is a defect on a faulted path.

**The disposition, independent of how D-4 is ruled:**
- U1 reads every work amount through its checked view, and each is exact or abandons with a typed `receipt_failure`, with no panic.
- A stage slot is emitted only under an exact `StageWork` status.
- The G-l `rejected` value is projected only when it is ≤ 2^53−1.
- Mutants pin the legacy-field substitutions and the stage-status check.

The detail-token vocabulary is D-4b, ruled at G2's return. I61 was messaged during the grant. RV82's brief (`BRIEFS/RV82_U1_SERIALIZER_REVIEW.md`, item 6) checks adoption in the returned code.

## U4 G2 verified; D-4, D-4b and S-1 ruled (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I65's G2 return** is `R/I65/u4_g2_01/`. SHA256SUMS covers 18 files and verifies OK, and there are no machine paths. It is records only: no Cargo, solver or native job, and no Git write.

**The results:**
- T02, T06, T07 and T22 close at the D1 caps;
- T03 and T08 close in part, as planned;
- DOMAIN.md gives D1 as a field-level predicate (D1.0–D1.9);
- BUILD.md designs the D-6 check;
- STACK_PLAN.md plans T20 under S1;
- API.md proposes the U3/U4 interface.

**ROOT spot-checked the citations D-4 relies on:**
- the C1:68 tokens, matching the schema's `receipt_failure.check` enum (:6505–6514);
- PP's ledger limits and guard (lib.rs:837–839 and :880–896);
- the exact-boundary `Work::charge` with `checked_add`;
- the Rust reader's `work_accounting` refusal (retained_precision.rs:904–917);
- `WorkTotal::exact` and `legacy_saturated` (FK work.rs).

All hold. The T08 pre-filter is stated as a lead only ("a site G3 does not cover is a missing term, never zero"), which is the right standard.

**D-4 is ruled as drafted** (D4_RECONCILIATION.md §5), for D1. C1 §2's upstream no-wrap premise is met by four things together:
- the accepted checked/sticky work custody (I34 API-02, RR:5260; source `fdae294643b`, RR:5468);
- the checked count and index sites with D1's caps (RESIDUALS T22);
- the guarded legacy ledger;
- U1's exact-only projection (§3, items 1–6).

This applies C1 §2's own named alternative, whose conditions (its own design, maintained write-set and review) the accepted I34/I37/RV51 records meet. It changes no schema, reader or public meaning. A work fault abandons the successor to the preserved ordinary base with the pre-reserved unavailable notice. RV82 checks items 1–6 in U1, and G4 records conformance. Wider F2a (combinations, several cases) needs its own reading.

**D-4b: stay inside the accepted vocabulary.** Any typed check or unavailable detail uses C1:68's tokens, which are the schema enum: overflow → `work_counter_range`; inconsistent (I or OI) → `work_counter_inconsistent`; a saturated legacy `rejected` → `saturation_not_excluded`. I34's `work_counter_overflow` and `work_counter_unknown` are not used in D1.
- A missing checked view must be unreachable by construction, because every amount is read through one (RR "Checked work custody in U1"). So "unknown" needs no token.
- No schema or reader change.

**S-1 is accepted.** R is reported as its own priced term, and the admission law checks `E_mov,max + R ≤ M`.
- This refines D-7's wording: M bounds the moving and requested heap plus the reserved stack R. It still makes no claim about RSS, measured stack, allocator overhead, concurrency or supported machines.
- R = 64 MiB and k = 16 (witness at 4 MiB) are provisional, confirmed or revised by G3's call-graph inventory.
- Each qualified build identity gets its own witness run (S1's standard: measured evidence, not proof).

**API.md** is accepted as the working interface for U3 (design-to-budget) and G5, subject to RV83. `CapturePermit` stays `pub(super)`, and maintained code has no test permit (decision 7).

**Next:**
- **RV83** gives G2 an independent re-derivation review (`BRIEFS/RV83_U4_G2_REVIEW.md`).
- **I65 continues to G3** (producer composition at the caps; records only; 8–12 h), in parallel with RV83, as the plan's standing assignment allows. G3 also owes:
  - the T08 per-site multiplicity and D1 reachability for all 707 sites;
  - the stack call-graph inventory, with the thread-local inventory for FK, LS, PL, SR, canonical_json and result_export;
  - the stride roster's use.
  
  If RV83 finds a G2 defect that G3 relied on, I65 repairs it in G3's packet with a pointer back.
- **I61 is told D-4b** for U1.

The next unused IDs are I66 and RV84; RV82 is reserved for U1.

## U1 grant 1 with U2 verified and committed; findings F1–F6; grant 2 and RV82 dispatched (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I61's return** is `R/I61/u1_serializer_01/`. SHA256SUMS has 27 entries and verifies OK, with no machine paths. ROOT committed the source on `codex/piping-f2a-serializer-20261004` as `59a5de2032` (base `43a6368c21`) and pushed it. All nine changed-file hashes in RETURN.md match the committed bytes.

**ROOT's own verification:**
- **The full core diff, read by ROOT.**
  - `lib.rs`: two `mod` lines, plus nine capture calls, each inside `if let Some(observer) = product.as_deref_mut()`. The only other changes are a local `legacy_attempted` flag, which is set and never branched on, and binding `amend_integrity_report`'s existing return value to `demoted`. No diagnostic, debit, message or control flow changes.
  - `retained_product_tests.rs`: `.certificate` → `.certificate()`, plus a comment. No assertion is removed or weakened.
  - `s11g_tests.rs`: one added test.
  - FK: one added method.
  - `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`: the `result_export` dev-dependency only, with no new external crate.
- **Unreachable in production:** `serialize_selected` is `pub(super)` with no non-test caller. The serializer has no `unwrap`, `expect` or `panic!`, and reads no legacy work field.
- **ROOT's test run** (default toolchain): PP `--lib` gave 472 passed, 1 failed, 1 ignored. The only failure is the known Mac platform test `t13_committed_fallback_uz_is_byte_identical`. All 16 U1/U2 tests pass, including `u1_milestone_successor_both_modes` (pinned successor bytes) and `u1_ordinary_bytes_unchanged_under_capture`.
- **I61's wider suites:** PP lib plus 21 integration targets, and runner/headless, each give the same outcome set as base apart from the added tests. result_export 149/149; FK `--lib` 480. The three readers pass G0–G8 in both modes with parity 98/98 and 99/99. 39/39 mutants are killed, none by a compile error.
- **Adoption of later decisions:**
  - "Checked work custody in U1": every amount goes through a checked view; stage slots need an exact status; a source-guard test forbids the legacy fields.
  - D-4b: `ReceiptCheck::wire()` maps only onto C1:68's tokens.
  
  Both are confirmed in the code, not only in the return.

**The byte differences against experiment 03** are the three members per mode that I61 lists (G-a's selected id and message, and F1), plus the two dependent hashes.

**Findings:**
- **F1, accepted as an application of C2:160.** `formation.d5_diagnostic_ref` names the integrity diagnostic when K-D5's `formation_check` line is part of it. C2:160 asks for "existing diagnostic evidence"; null would understate evidence that exists. RV82 checks that the capture predicate (`formation_check.is_some()` at the report) holds exactly when that line is written into that diagnostic.
- **F2, accepted as T1 (a) composed with D39.** T1 (a) omits the legacy disclosure on a retained-selected case, and D39 gives the disposition by branch. A selected case whose legacy route declined without an attempt is `{declined_without_attempt, null, work_ref → its actual 0/0/0 WorkReport}`. The owner's T1 decision concerns the omitted disclosure; this applies it, so it is not a new owner question. The milestone does not exercise this branch.
- **F3, fail-closed, held.** A case demoted after the report by R-b′ is refused typed and never emitted with a disguised outcome. A wire representation for it is a contract question for wider F2a. It does not gate the milestone, which does not reach it. U3 maps the refusal to the unavailable fallback.
- **F4, routed to I65:** the T11 delta pass now that U1(a) is frozen at `59a5de2032`. `OrdinarySeed` and the serializer's JSON working set enter M.
- **F5, tracked (D36):** the exact D6a list and the method token are pinned by the committed bytes, not by the readers. This is a candidate for the next reader round.
- **F6, noted:** the meter fault is killed by the source guard, because the meter cannot be faulted from PP.

**Fence notes, accepted:**
- the two `mod` declarations are the wiring the new files need;
- the `s11g_tests.rs` addition is test-only and additive (it kills M19);
- `PreparedCandidateRefusal.certificate` stays `pub` until grant 2 serializes a refusal. Completing U2 on the failure path is in grant 2.

**Dispatch:**
- **RV82** reviews `59a5de2032` under `BRIEFS/RV82_U1_SERIALIZER_REVIEW.md`, plus F1's predicate check.
- **I61: U1 grant 2,** in the same worktree on top of `59a5de2032`, while RV82 reviews. It covers:
  - G-i's closed translations;
  - D38's representation (`run: null`, `run_ref: null`, a `capture` error) for an early prepared-solve failure;
  - the refusal and failure-work owner binding, with `PreparedCandidateRefusal.certificate` made private;
  - the remaining mutants.
  
  RV82's findings on grant 1 are repaired in the same stream, and each is reported separately.
- **A D38 receipt** is expected to fail the current readers only at the stricter "native entered ⇒ Run" rule. I61 records the exact check. The next reader round relaxes the readers to D38 and pins that receipt. No other reader failure is acceptable.

## RV83 on U4 G2: FAIL; dispositions and the G2 repairs routed into G3 (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV83's report** is `R/REVIEW_RV83/u4_g2_01/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `14856555…bf6`; SHA256SUMS OK; no machine paths). Verdict: FAIL, with 3 BLOCKING, 6 SHOULD-FIX and 13 NOTE findings. None reopens D-1, D-3, D-4b, D-6 = (a) or S-1.

**ROOT confirmed the blocking findings in source:**
- **B-1:** in PP/lib.rs:4965–4976, the exact-selected branch calls `FinalizedSourceBlockCase::exact`. `requested()` is `serde_json::from_value(self.raw.clone())` (source_receipt.rs:136–139), and it is called again at :875 and :965.
- **B-3:** BUILD.md:34–55 emits newline-separated text through one `cargo:rustc-env` directive. Cargo reads build-script output line by line, so only the first line survives.
- **S-4:** `normalize_model_units` runs on every request that passes validation (PP/lib.rs:2326–2331), not only on requests with sections.

**What re-derived** (NOTE): T02, T06, the derived counts and monotonicity, the T03 roster, BTree 640/736 and the hashbrown law, the f64 spellings, the milestone counts, the refusal map, every T22 site's existence at its line, D-4's quotations and citations, R/k as a provisional proposal, and API.md.

**Dispositions.** I65 repairs each item inside G3's packet, as a G2 amendment with a pointer back.
- **B-1, accepted.** Selected source-blocks finalization becomes a new term, **T25**, in G3. Its owners at the caps:
  - per case: `check_input` and `check_input_with_physical` (the re-parse, normalization, model build, dense stiffness, loads and force ledger);
  - per invocation: two more `requested()` calls and `serialized(envelope)`.
  
  T07's "Remaining: none" is withdrawn, and T07 points to T25. A field predicate cannot exclude these inputs, so D1 is unchanged. STACK_PLAN's witness W3 already exercises this path.
- **B-2, accepted.** The G3 direction "all 707 sites" is replaced: **every text-producing site on the D1 call graph,** across every linked crate. That covers:
  - `format!`, `write!`, `diag`;
  - `to_string`;
  - Display and Debug impls, including str/String Debug.
  
  The 707 inventory is a starting subset. A bound may be per site or per function family, provided every reachable site is covered by exactly one stated bound. Each exclusion needs a call-path argument. A site not covered is a missing term.
- **B-3 and S-5, accepted. The D-6 design is amended before G5:**
  - the identity is one line, with an explicit escaping rule; one `rustc-env` per key, compared jointly, is also acceptable;
  - the profile reads it with `option_env!`, and absence means `Stale`;
  - a G5 test proves that the compiled value carries every key in order;
  - G6 generates the registered texts with the same encoder.
  
  This implements the owner's option (a) correctly; it is not a new owner question.
- **S-1, accepted.** T07 is repaired: the two `Snapshot.identity` copies, `to_string` capacity rather than length, descriptors counted before the count check, capacity slack, and the 3-versus-7 descriptor count reconciled.
- **S-2, accepted.** T22 is repaired: I34's `r*r` (`ceil_sqrt` and the unchecked `2*ceil_sqrt`), the source.rs:358 label, the remaining I34 DESIGN.md:255–265 classes, and a reproducible `CountRange` count. **The D-4 ruling's T22 citation is re-pointed** to the repaired table in G3's packet. D-4's outcome is unchanged, and RV83 found the reading applies C1 §2's own alternative.
- **S-3, accepted.** D1.9 gains typed capacity caps (Strings, Vecs, property trees, typed Values), read from actual capacities by the T03 census. I65 proposes the values.
- **S-4, ruled: both.**
  - **D1 is narrowed:** `pipe_segments[i].section_ref` is None and `model.sections` is empty. The milestone has none. If I65 finds that the L = 0 base or a U8 witness needs sections, it reports that rather than pricing them now.
  - **G3 adds a T05 row** for the phase that runs on every request: `normalize_model_units` and the no-section `resolve_shared_sections`, with their old/new pairs.
- **S-6, accepted.** Add str/String Debug (6·len+2) and `{:032x}`, and complete the composite-Debug split, inside the B-2 work.
- **NOTE items:** I65's discretion. The T06 citation should name `wide/multi.rs`.

**The estimate.** B-1 and B-2 add real scope to G3. I65 re-estimates at its next boundary. If G3 exceeds its 12-hour upper by more than half, it returns the completed part and a precise remainder rather than continuing silently.

**Confirmation.** RV83 confirms the G2 repairs when G3 returns. A fresh reviewer, RV84, reviews G3 itself. The next unused IDs are I66 and RV85.

## RV82 on U1 grant 1: PASS; routing (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV82's report** is `R/REVIEW_RV82/u1_serializer_01/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `cffa9313…c1f`; SHA256SUMS 36/36 OK; no machine paths). Verdict: **PASS**, with 0 BLOCKING, 2 SHOULD-FIX and 9 NOTE findings, on `59a5de2032`.

**What RV82 established independently:**
- **Its own derivation of the milestone receipt agrees in 86 of 86 checks,** in both modes. It covers T1 (a), D39, decision 2, A1, G-a, G-b, G-d, G-e, G-j, the fixture hashes and every receipt hash.
- **The difference from experiment 03 is reproduced exactly** by applying only G-a and F1.
- **The three readers pass with RV82's own invocation,** with parity 98/98 and 99/99.
- **Ordinary bytes are identical** with and without capture for 41 fixture requests × 2 modes. The PP, runner/headless and result_export outcome sets equal base apart from the added tests.
- **U2 is sound for one case,** and checked work custody holds.
- **F1's predicate holds exactly,** in source and over 90 captured seeds. **F2 matches T1 (a) and D39.**
- **Mutants:** I61's 39/39 are killed again; RV82's own: 10 of 18 killed. The survivors are listed in S1, N1 and N2.

**ROOT confirmed S2 in the code at `59a5de2032`.** `serialize_selected` checks `pc.invocation_mode` against the invocation's mode, and takes the case id from the invocation's raw request. Nothing else binds the invocation argument to the capture.

**Routing:**
- **S1, to U1 grant 2:** pin F1 in both directions. Add `d5_diagnostic_ref == None` in `u1_load_row_case_capture`, which kills R06.
- **S2, to U1 grant 2, before U3 wires the serializer:** `ProductCapture::invocation` records the invocation's identity (its digest), and the serializer refuses `association` on any mismatch. Add a test with a same-mode invocation whose case label differs.
- **N1, to grant 2:** add committed negative tests for the six defensive checks (R08–R10, R13, R14 and R22), so that each survivor is killed.
- **N6, to grant 2:** correct the doc comment ("last member").
- **N7, to grant 2:** make the encoder record the first failure strictly, or document the precedence.
- **N3, to U3:** B′ becomes a committed test with the permit path. Correct the test comment in grant 2.
- **N4:** already in grant 2 (refusal `certificate` private).
- **N5, to I65 G4:** record that producer-side conservation leaves build flags and execution order to the readers.
- **N8, to wider F2a:** `owner_matches` and the stamp's `run` for several cases.
- **N9, noted:** G-d's one-owner-per-DOF is stricter than C2 and fails closed in D1. Revisit in wider F2a.
- **N2:** an equivalent mutant; no action.

**U1 grant 1 is accepted on review.** It merges into NUM with grant 2 once grant 2 has been verified and reviewed, so no intermediate merge is made. RV82 confirms S1, S2 and N1 in grant 2's review.

## U1 grant 2: I61's stop resolved (a ROOT error corrected); committed as `b54caba7ab`; RV82 re-dispatched (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I61 stopped as instructed.** Every one-case unavailable receipt, including both D38 receipts, fails first at G3 `COVERAGE_MISMATCH` ("no selected case") in all three readers, not at the later "native entered ⇒ Run" check that ROOT's grant expected.

**The error was ROOT's.** ROOT's own earlier ruling "T3, decided" (in "All readers on 07c; the real-receipt experiment's findings", RR:8436–8437) states that "a one-case invocation whose case is unavailable has no successor publication". The readers enforce exactly that.
- **Corrected:** grant 2's expectation, and decision 4's "pinned in the next reader round".
- **Not corrected, because it was right:** D38's representation itself.

**The disposition:**
- **The readers are faithful;** no reader changes.
- **The D38 reader relaxation and its pin move to wider F2a.** Only a multi-case successor can carry an unavailable case beside a selected one. They are tracked under D36.
- **The milestone domain is unaffected.** A one-case unavailable invocation takes U3's ordinary fallback with `RETAINED_PRECISION_UNAVAILABLE` and preserved ordinary bytes.
- **`serialize_unavailable` stays private and is not a publication.** It is kept for wider F2a, and review covers it.
- **S-2 (D38 with a prepared source) and S-3 (a source-constructor `source_decline`) stay fail-closed, accepted.** Their contract readings (C2 §4 identity bytes before registration; the constructor counts) are wider F2a and do not gate the milestone.
- **`UnresolvedReason::WorkAccounting`'s `prior`:** this is C2 §2's own wire form, which carries the fault only; the private prior stays private. In D1 a work fault abandons the successor anyway, under checked custody and D-4, so it never reaches the wire.

**ROOT's verification:**
- SHA256SUMS for `R/I61/u1_serializer_02/`: 21/21 OK, no machine paths.
- All six changed-file hashes match the committed bytes.
- `lib.rs` is unchanged.

**ROOT read the diffs:**
- **FK** adds `anchor: Option<Arc<ProofAnchor>>` to `ProductCertificateSpent`, set where the anchor is created, plus `owner_matches` on the work and on `ProductProofFailure`. No `strong_count` or `try_unwrap` use exists in product_certificate.
- **PP:**
  - `invocation_digest` is recorded at `invocation()`;
  - `PreparedCandidateRefusal.certificate` is private, with accessors;
  - the C3 seam refuses foreign proof work.
- **Tests:** the only removed lines are a doc comment (N3), and the two-case expectation, which changes from `Scope` to `Association{invocation}`. That is stricter, because S2 now refuses the foreign invocation first.
- **No panic or legacy work read** on any production path.

**ROOT's run** (default toolchain): PP `--lib` gave 486 passed, 1 failed, 1 ignored. t13 is the only failure, and all 30 serializer tests pass. **I61's run:** PP 648/1/1 with only added tests, runner/headless identical, FK `--lib` 480, and 46 of 48 mutants killed. The two survivors cannot be constructed from PP.

**For RV82 to assess:** a proof whose start fails before its anchor exists now projects as `WorkAssociation`, not as its own failure. It is fail-closed, but the classification may be wrong. In D1 this does not reach a publication.

**Next:**
- **RV82** reviews grant 2 and confirms its S1, S2 and N1 on `b54caba7ab`.
- **U1 merges into NUM** after RV82 passes.
- **U3** is prepared: the brief and I61's design checkpoint on D-a to D-d.

## RV82 on U1 grant 2: PASS; U1 and U2 merged into NUM (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV82's report** is `R/REVIEW_RV82/u1_serializer_02/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `edabda27…e57`; SHA256SUMS 32/32 OK; no machine paths). Verdict: **PASS**, with 0 BLOCKING, 0 SHOULD-FIX and 9 NOTE findings, on `b54caba7ab`.

**Confirmed by RV82:**
- **S2 is complete.** Six one-change foreign invocations are refused, and an identical or canonically equal invocation is emitted.
- **S1 is fixed,** and N3, N6 and N7 are done.
- **N1:** five of six checks are killed at their sites.
- **G-i:** RV82's hand derivation agrees on 62 of 62 entries across 20 tables. All 260 encodable values are schema-valid.
- **U2's failure path is sound.**
- **The pre-anchor proof-start case is rightly `WorkAssociation`.** The only reachable pre-anchor failure is the owner-stamp refusal, whose own cause is association, so no genuine D1 failure is misreported.
- **`serialize_unavailable`** cannot reach production; all three readers refuse its output at G3, as RR:8436 requires.
- **No other behaviour changed:** PP 648/1/1; runner/headless and result_export identical; the milestone successor bytes identical; reader parity 98/98 and 99/99.

**Rulings on the notes:**
- **N1′:** pin R08 at its call site in `run_conservation`. This is a small item for I61, in the U3 stream.
- **N2 and N3′:** go to wider F2a. PP cannot produce a non-selected native run or anchorless proof work; an FK unit test is optional there.
- **N7: a citation correction to ROOT's grant-2 ruling.** The `prior` omission rests on RR:7784 and C3:261–263, not on "C2 §2's own wire form"; C2 §2 has no `work_accounting` row. The outcome is unchanged.
- **N8:** the two-case Scope branch is unreachable in grant 2. It is kept as a defensive check, and wider F2a revisits it.
- **N9: added to U3.** Keep a single parse per invocation, so that the typed request and the captured invocation come from one `CapturedInvocation::parse`.
- **N4, N5 and N6:** equivalent or unconstructible; no action.

**The merge.** ROOT merged `codex/piping-f2a-serializer-20261004` (`b54caba7ab`) into NUM with `--no-ff`. NUM's core had not changed since `43a6368c21`, so the merge is clean, and NUM's core now equals `b54caba7ab` byte for byte.
- **What it covers:** U1 (the private serializer, production-unreachable) and U2 (the structural owner binding).
- **What it does not do:** enable eligibility, a permit or any public activation.

**Open items:**
- **U3** is running (I61, `WT/f2a-facade`, from `b54caba7ab`), and **U4 G3** is running (I65).
- **The next reader round** gathers the D36-tracked items: RV79-N1, RV80-N2, RV78's N1 and N2, and F5. D38's pin moves to wider F2a (RR "U1 grant 2: I61's stop resolved").

## U4 G3 verified; D1.10 and D1.11 adopted; the margin rule (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I65's G3 return** is `R/I65/u4_g3_01/`. SHA256SUMS: 56/56 OK, with no machine paths. Records only.

It closes:
- T05, including the O-N row;
- T11–T15 and T21;
- the new T25 (RV83 B-1);
- T08 text over the whole D1 call graph (B-2 and S-6), covering 1,881 functions and 2,563 sites;
- T07 and T22 as repaired (S-1, S-2);
- the T20 recursion inventory: 18 self-recursive functions, no mutual recursion, R = 64 MiB and k = 16 confirmed;
- the G2 amendments for B-3/S-5 (a one-line escaped identity read with `option_env!`), S-3 and S-4;
- COMPOSITION §4's `LateFacts` and `CompleteFacts` for API.md.

**I65 found and fixed a defect in its own call graph during the grant.** Multi-segment path calls were dropped. RV84 samples the graph.

**The fit at the caps** (M = 4,026,531,840 B; ASSUMED strides; E_mov + R):
- **Branch X** (exact-block selected; finalization T25 runs under G-A's span):
  - 5.54–5.56 GB with today's D1, which does not fit;
  - 3.50–3.52 GB with D1.11, which fits, at 0.87 M.
- **Branch W** (W1 runs), the G3 part only: 1.93–1.95 GB, or 0.48 M. That leaves about 2.08 GB for G4's T16–T19.
- **`admit` must cover `max(E_X, E_W + G4)`,** because it decides before the branch is known.

**Adopted into D1.** ROOT rules on D1, and the milestone complies with both clauses. The census checks each without allocating.
- **D1.10:** no primitive load's `provenance` begins, after whitespace, with `{`. This keeps every D1 input out of the self-weight validation module. Its per-load parse attempt stays priced in O-N.
- **D1.11:** no raw string value or key contains a byte below 0x20 or the byte 0x7F. That caps JSON escape expansion at 2.

The refusal map gains both clauses under `source_family` and `resource_admission` respectively. I65 confirms the kinds in G4.

**D-4's T22 citation** is re-pointed to `R/I65/u4_g3_01/RESIDUALS_G3.md` §T22. D-4's outcome is unchanged.

**The margin rule.** It applies at G4 with illustrative strides, and G5 re-evaluates in-build. The composed maximum, `max(E_X, E_W + G4) + R`, must be at most **0.9 M**. The margin absorbs stride differences in the build.
- If G4's composition exceeds 0.9 M, I65 returns a **sensitivity table**: the maximum as a function of each cap (n, m, g, r, s, l, the text caps, the raw totals) and of ε.
- ROOT then chooses:
  - **tighter caps** (preferred, as the smallest intervention); or
  - **the lifetime-aware text model,** as a separate grant; or
  - **a bound evaluated per invocation** at the actual census facts, which the monotonicity lemmas allow, in place of a cap-priced constant.
- The text refinement is **not** scheduled now. Branch X passes at 0.87 M, and G4's number decides whether any refinement is needed.

**Next:**
- **RV83** confirms its G2 findings against `G2_AMENDMENTS.md`, `RESIDUALS_G3.md` (T07, T22, T25) and `TEXT.md`.
- **RV84** (new) reviews G3 under `BRIEFS/RV84_U4_G3_REVIEW.md`.
- **I65 proceeds to G4** (design-to-budget; records only):
  - T16–T19 against U1 as merged in NUM, at `4a13e369b9` and later;
  - the U1 text part of T08;
  - the T24 composition per caller and mode, with the margin rule and, if needed, the sensitivity table;
  - RV82-N5 (producer conservation leaves build flags and execution order to the readers);
  - the D-6 lock re-pin after U3's runtime dependency;
  - the budgets U3 must meet.
- **Reminder to I65:** scratch files go under `WT/scratch/`, never the system temp directory.

The next unused IDs are I66 and RV85.

## U3 grant 1 verified; R-1, R-2 and R-3 ruled (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I61's U3 grant 1** is `R/I61/u3_facade_01/` (SHA256SUMS OK; no machine paths). ROOT committed it, with the R-3 lock deltas, as `bee3dc07ca` on `codex/piping-f2a-facade-20261004` (from `b54caba7ab`), and pushed it. Every changed-file hash matches I61's record.

**ROOT's verification:**
- **The production dispatch, read in full.**
  - `admit` is the former `assess` body returning `Result`, and `assess` now wraps it.
  - `RegisteredProfile` is still uninhabited, so `permitted_dispatch` is statically unreachable.
  - The refused path is `ordinary_dispatch`, with the same census, budget, captured run and finalization check as before.
- **ROOT's test run** (default toolchain): PP `--lib` gave 492 passed, 1 failed, 1 ignored. t13 is the only failure, and the five facade tests pass.
- **I61's evidence:**
  - a 324-output sweep (36 fixtures × 5 routes × 2 modes, including the admission report), byte-identical to base;
  - PP outcomes unchanged plus 6 added tests; runner/headless identical;
  - 33 of 33 mutants killed;
  - a disposable-stub run of the actual Direct entry that publishes U1's pinned successor bytes in both modes, with the stub absent from maintained code.

**R-1, the carrier: Proposal A is adopted.** It is additive:
- `RetainedPreviewOutput::successor()`;
- `into_publication() -> RetainedPublication { Ordinary | Successor }`;
- `envelope()` and `into_parts()` unchanged.

It returns a successor only under a permit, so until U4 G6 it always yields the ordinary publication. It lands in U3 grant 1b. U6 reviews it as the carrier interface. Public activation stays with U7.

**R-2, the notice: N1 is adopted, as the accepted design texts require.** The texts are ROUTING:96/98, C1:64/68, D1:573 and COMP:66.
- **When no W1 work ran,** the publication keeps exactly the ordinary bytes. That covers G-A, G-B and G-C refusals, a stack spawn failure, the domain guard and coexistence.
- **After W1 work ran** (a preparation, native, candidate, serializer or precommit fallback), exactly one info `RETAINED_PRECISION_UNAVAILABLE` diagnostic is appended after the ordinary prefix:
  - `affected_refs` is `[case]`;
  - the text is fixed product text;
  - there is no receipt reference;
  - on a receipt-encoding fallback, the text carries C1:68's reason and detail token from `ReceiptFailure::check.wire()`, never Debug text.
- **The space is reserved before W1 starts.** G4 prices it.
- **A condition still to be established.** ROOT checked that every base schema types a diagnostic's `code` as an open string. Grant 1b must establish, by test, that the base `preview-physics-1` readers and carriers accept such a publication: result_export's base readers, the desktop result admission and runner/headless. **If any rejects it, that is a stop.** The conflict then returns to ROOT, and through ROOT to the owner, because the fix would be a base-reader change.
- **Who sees it:** this changes published bytes only for permitted invocations. None exists until U4 G6, and the desktop app calls only the ordinary wrapper.

**R-3, the downstream locks: accepted, and applied by ROOT** in `bee3dc07ca`. Each of the six `Cargo.lock` files gains only the in-repo `open_pipe_stress_result_export` edge, and the package block where it was missing. No registry package or version changes.
- `cargo metadata --locked --offline` passes for PP and five of the six manifests.
- The Tauri app's check needs an uncached registry crate offline; its delta is the same one-line edge as runner/headless.
- CI's `--locked` run verifies all six online.
- The D-6 lock re-pin follows, in I65 G4.

**Findings routed:**
- **F-5, to I65 G5:** under D-2, `admit` must refuse Headless.
- **F-2, F-3, F-4, F-6 and F-8:** noted.

**Flagged by ROOT for RV85 and grant 2:**
- **`CapturePermit` now derives `Copy`.** Should a permit be linear (consumed once) rather than copyable?
- **The test fault hooks are `thread_local!`.** Once the permitted path runs on the reserved-stack thread, a hook set on the caller's thread would not fire. Grant 2's committed fault tests must not pass vacuously.

**Next:**
- **RV85** reviews `bee3dc07ca` under `BRIEFS/RV85_U3_FACADE_REVIEW.md`.
- **I61** does U3 grant 1b (R-1, R-2 and the base-reader acceptance test), then U5: the reference comparison on the pinned successor bytes against I50's named oracle.
- **U3 grant 2** (the real `admit`, and committed permit-path tests) waits for U4 G5.

The next unused IDs are I66 and RV86.

## RV83 confirmation of the G2 repairs: NOT CONFIRMED (B-2 only); R-1–R-3 routed to G4 (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV83's confirmation** is `R/REVIEW_RV83/u4_g2_02/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `f13d61a6…`; SHA256SUMS OK; no machine paths). Its earlier packet `u4_g2_01` still verifies 10/10 and is unchanged in Git, after the probe slip RV83 disclosed.

**Its findings:**
- B-1, B-3, S-1, S-2, S-3, S-5 and S-6 are **fixed**.
- S-4 is **superseded** by ROOT's "both" ruling, and implemented as ruled.
- **B-2 is not fixed.** Two residuals remain.
- **D1.10's argument holds.**

**New findings, with ROOT's rulings:**
- **R-1 (SHOULD-FIX): the T08 call graph is not an over-approximation.** It drops method calls on generic-typed receivers (24 calls hiding 64 functions) and chained calls such as `f().g(` and `x?.g(` (21 names hiding 44 functions); the `METHOD` regex is defined but unused. The only D1 text hidden is formation_check.rs's 5 sites, which T05's `Text(formation_detail)` already prices. **But STACK_INVENTORY's "no mutual recursion" was computed on the same graph.**
  - **Ruled:** I65 repairs the call graph in G4: generic receivers, chained calls, and any similar pattern its own audit finds. It reruns TEXT and STACK_INVENTORY on the repaired graph, and replaces the claim "never under-counts" with a stated method and its limits.
  - RV84, which is sampling the graph now, is told.
- **R-2 (SHOULD-FIX): `validate_profile`'s exclusion is false.** ROOT confirmed this at pressure_runtime.rs:207–225. In a non-exact model, a nonzero primitive load with `category == "pressure"` emits `PRESSURE_MODEL_REAUTHOR_REQUIRED`, and D1.7 does not constrain `category`. The invocation then blocks, so W1 never runs.
  - **Ruled: price it** and drop the exclusion: about 2 KB per load, about 0.4 MB at the caps. A new D1 clause would add census code and a refusal-map entry to avoid an immaterial term.
- **R-3 (SHOULD-FIX):** the O-N row lacks the provenance-parse term, which the D1.10 ruling relied on. The transient can be a parsed non-object JSON Value of up to about 30 KB, not a 40-byte `Error`.
  - **Ruled:** add it to O-N in G4 at its true bound.
- **NOTEs, to G5:**
  - `rerun-if-changed=src/build_identity.rs`;
  - an empty environment variable is a value, not a read failure (`target.env` is empty on Apple);
  - add `collect::<String>` (lib.rs:1757) to the lexicon.

**Closure.** R-1, R-2 and R-3 close as G4 carry-overs. **B-2 counts as confirmed** when RV83, or RV84 if RV83 is unavailable, confirms those repairs at G4's return. No composed figure changes materially in the meantime: R-1's hidden text is already priced, and R-2 adds about 0.4 MB.

## RV84 on U4 G3: PASS; routing to G4 and U3, and the admission law restated (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV84's report** is `R/REVIEW_RV84/u4_g3_01/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `706fe500…`; SHA256SUMS 36/36 OK; no machine paths). Verdict: **PASS**, with 0 BLOCKING, 7 SHOULD-FIX and 13 NOTE findings. No ruling moves.

**What reproduces independently:**
- the headline figures, within 0.01%;
- T07, T22 and T11 (`OrdinarySeed` plus `invocation_digest`);
- the six I54 milestone sub-expressions and the monotonicity lemmas;
- the thread-local inventory;
- D1.10, and D1.11's cap of 2 on escaping;
- 29 of 30 sampled functions against the site inventory.

**The call graph.** RV84 cites RV83's R-1 and confirms it with an independent fan-out: 1,982 functions reached, not 1,881. It adds one more dropped pattern (S-1). Its augmented graph shows 17 new cycles; the one traced is a name collision. So "no mutual recursion" is **open, not refuted** (N-3), and R and k are unaffected on present evidence.

**Routed to I65's G4.** Each is a G3 repair reported separately:
- **S-1:** the `CALL` lookbehind drops `"k":f(x)`. That hides T25's commitment text: 84.8 MB at the packet's byte classes, 9.1 MB at real spellings.
- **S-2:** broad zero rules (`components`, `wind` matching "windows", `intensity`) zero real D1 loops; about 35.9 MB is missed.
- **S-3:** the hash route omits the per-string `serde_json::to_string` temporary: 10.2 MB at ε = 2. Fix it before G4 reuses the route for T16 and T17.
- **S-4:** T25's commitment coefficients are missing the identity string, the N² aggregate-bits matrix and the per-atom factor objects: 0.10–0.22 GB. They do not set the peak.
- **N-2:** `?` conversions into `CaptureError` allocate a few bytes. Correct TEXT.md's claim.
- **N-3:** re-establish "no mutual recursion" on the repaired graph, together with RV83's R-1.

**S-5: the admission law is restated.** This corrects ROOT's G3 ruling, which wrote `max(E_X, E_W + G4)`. `admit` covers **the maximum, over both branches, of every phase through caller completion**:
- **branch X:** the ordinary span with T25, plus its own completion: the fallback reserve (T18) and Direct completion (T19);
- **branch W:** the ordinary span, plus G-B, G-C, the W1 phases, publication, validation, transfer and completion.

The margin rule (≤ 0.9 M at illustrative strides) applies to this maximum.

**The margin.** On RV84's figures, S-1–S-3 at the packet's byte classes put branch X (dense, ε = 2) at 0.907 M, over the rule. With RV84's tighter T25 model it is 0.881 M.
- G4 applies the rule to the repaired text and the corrected T25 together.
- **If it trips,** the sensitivity table must include RV84's two levers, in addition to the caps:
  - **N-6:** T25 priced only where exact selection is possible. 41,760 descriptor units exceed the 16,384 limit, so selection is impossible at the full caps;
  - **S-7:** removing the double-counted ordinary-route text.

**S-6: the gate facts.**
- The G-B hook (`prepared_case_source`, PP/lib.rs:5009) does not receive rows, diagnostics or errors.
- `source_cases` no longer exists at G-C.
- The late capture is never measured after it is made.
- `diag_total` is mislabelled.

**Ruled:** I65 amends API.md in G4 with the exact hook signatures and the facts each gate reads. The PP/lib.rs hook change is I61's, as integration owner under D-5: it lands in U3 grant 2 or at the G5 integration point, to I65's specification.

**S-7, a U3 budget:** "exactly one ordinary run per invocation." I51's single observed run and U3's dispatch already intend this. G4 records it as a budget, and U3 grant 2 pins it with a test on the permitted path; `ordinary_dispatch_entered` exists for this.

**NOTEs:** N-7 (the `checked_mul` scope wording), N-11 (the undocumented 2 MiB moving candidate) and N-13 (the top-ten counts are over-counts) go to G4 as wording corrections.

## RV85 on U3 grant 1: PASS, merged; U3 grant 1b and U5 verified; reviews dispatched (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV85's report** is `R/REVIEW_RV85/u3_facade_01/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `8caa9ef7…`; SHA256SUMS 33/33 OK; no machine paths). Verdict: **PASS**, with 0 BLOCKING, 3 SHOULD-FIX and 7 NOTE findings, on `bee3dc07ca`.

**RV85 established independently:**
- **No published byte changes while no permit exists.** Its own sweep covered 55 inputs × 5 routes × 2 modes (550 rows, including the admission reports), byte-identical to base.
- **Suites:** the failure sets equal base. PP gave 654/1/1 (base plus 6 tests); runner/headless and result_export are unchanged.
- **The R-3 lock deltas** are exactly as ruled.
- **Mutants:** I61's 25 are killed, R08b is killed, and RV85's own 12 kill 9.
- **Its own disposable stub** publishes U1's pinned successor bytes through the actual Direct entry, with G-B, G-C and stack fallbacks as designed.

**The merge.** ROOT merged `bee3dc07ca` into NUM as `b1f80234dc` with `--no-ff`. NUM's maintained source equals `bee3dc07ca` byte for byte.

**RV85's findings:**
- **S1 (the copyable permit) and S2 (thread-local hooks):** already addressed in grant 1b (below). RV85 confirms them.
- **S3:** permitted invocations lose their G-A report, so `admission()` returns None, contrary to its public doc and to DOMAIN §3.
  - **Ruled:** on success, `admit` returns the permit **together with** the admission report, and `admission()` is `Some` for permitted calls.
  - I65 records the signature in API.md (G4), and I61 implements it in grant 2.
- **N1:** G-C must not run after a G-B refusal or an exact-block selection; record the correct cause. This goes to grant 2.
- **N2:** a committed test that kills V07 (the G-B refusal check) on the permitted path. Grant 2.
- **N5:** price staging (the ordinary envelope, the staged clone and the `to_value` tree coexisting). G4.
- **N6:** replace the staging overlay's `unwrap` and `expect` on the production path with a typed fallback. Grant 2.
- **N7:** strengthen the single-parse guard (`from_str(`, `deserialize(`, and the `permitted_dispatch(` call-site count). Grant 2.
- **N3 and N4:** no action.

**U3 grant 1b** is `R/I61/u3_facade_02/` (26 files OK; no machine paths). ROOT committed it as `4b31bbf23a` on the facade branch and pushed it.
- **R-1:** public `RetainedPublication { Ordinary, Successor }`, `successor()` and `into_publication()`, all yielding `Ordinary` while no permit exists.
- **R-2's condition is established:**
  - result_export's base `for_source`, the desktop admission (`sourceContract`, `validatePreviewPhysicsEvidence`, `numericalResultStanding`), runner/headless (status, diagnostics, export) and the Python base reader each accept a base publication carrying the notice, with standing unchanged;
  - each refuses a malformed notice.
  
  **N1 is implemented** as ruled, with its space reserved before W1 (`ReservedNotice`).
- **The permit is linear;** the fault hooks are carried onto the reserved-stack thread.
- **ROOT's run:** PP `--lib` gave 497 passed, 1 failed (t13), 1 ignored, with all 10 facade tests passing. **I61's controls:** the 324-output sweep is unchanged, runner/headless is identical, and 38 of 39 mutants are killed. The survivor is the unreachable `PermitUnbound` arm.
- **F-1, accepted:** only C1:68's named details make a receipt-encoding notice (the three work-counter tokens and `publication_hash_range`). An `association` or `encoding` serializer refusal gets the plain text.
- **F-3:** the notice slot (about 196 B) is priced in G4. **F-4:** noted.

**U5, the reference comparison, PASS on I61's evidence** (`R/I61/u5_reference_01/`; SHA256SUMS OK).
- In both modes, all 97 class claims of the pinned milestone successor (25 relative, 69 absolute, 3 input-derived) agree with I50's named oracle, against both readouts.
- The maxima, overlay and support rows pass the oracle's own observable checks. No mapping needed a reading, and the negative controls are refused.
- **Informational:** the stop-rule-sharp bound misses on 7 J-dependent rows against the represented readout, attributed to 2-ulp section-term differences.
- **A local-only recovery dependency:** U5 reads I50's captured log from `WT/scratch/i50_first_publishing/runtime02/`, which is hash-bound to I50's BULK_MANIFEST.
- **Review:** RV86 independently reviews U5 (`BRIEFS/RV86_U5_REFERENCE_REVIEW.md`), including whether "matches its independent reference" holds and with what stated limit.

**Next:**
- **RV85** reviews grant 1b and confirms S1 and S2.
- **RV86** reviews U5.
- **U3 grant 2 waits for U4 G5.** It carries S3's implementation, N1, N2, N6, N7, RV84's S-6 hook change and S-7's one-run test, and reruns U5's script unchanged on the committed facade output.

The next unused IDs are I67 and RV87.

## RV86 on U5: PASS, with stated limits; the milestone's reference claim scoped (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV86's report** is `R/REVIEW_RV86/u5_reference_01/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `f0f39cfe…`; SHA256SUMS OK; no machine paths). Verdict: **PASS**, with 0 BLOCKING, 2 SHOULD-FIX and 5 NOTE findings.

**What RV86 established:**
- **Agreement:** in both modes, all 97 published class claims agree with the reference:
  - 25 `relative_verified` rows within 1e-9;
  - 69 `absolute_verified` rows within their receipt bounds;
  - 3 `input_derived` rows exact.
- **Against what:** both of I50's oracle readouts, and an independent closed-form reference RV86 wrote without the oracle's code. The worst relative error is 8.1e-17.
- **Reproduction:** the unchanged script reproduces I61's report and log byte for byte.
- **Counts and mapping:** RV86's own recount from the successor bytes matches the receipt's lists, scales, bounds and classes bit for bit. The oracle slices are exact, and the hash pins bind the right files.
- **The 7 represented-readout misses** on the stop-rule-sharp bound are a faithful consequence of the representation, not a defect. That bound is not a published claim.

**The milestone claim "matches its independent reference" is ruled to mean, for U7:**
- every **published class claim** of the facade-published successor agrees with I50's named oracle and with an independent closed-form reference, in both modes;
- the classes and bounds are those the accepted reader's G5c confirms.

**Stated limits:**
- it does **not** claim the sharper stop-rule bound against I50's represented section;
- it does **not** claim that the extrema intervals enclose the truth, which their declared scope excludes (N-4; the cheap within-bound check passes);
- it rests today on PP's committed-test and stub-dispatch bytes. **U3 grant 2 re-confirms it** by rerunning the unchanged script on the committed facade output.

**Routed:**
- **S-1, to I61 as a RETURN addendum before U7.** It corrects a wording error only; no rerun.
  - The 7 misses depend on J through the receipt's k_t, not on A and Z. I50's represented J is about 4.3 ulps above the exact annulus J.
  - The affected set also includes N1 rx, whose J share is 1e-4.
- **N-2, in the same addendum:** the oracle does have value checks for the mode and parity rows, and RV86 applied them; they pass.
- **S-2, the local-only dependency: removed.**
  - RV86's 7,240-byte extract of I50's log is committed with its derivation script. It is all U5 reads, and it reproduces the report and log byte for byte.
  - At grant 2's rerun, I61 switches the script to the committed extract (the two-line pin change), keeping the hash assertion against I50's BULK_MANIFEST entry for the full log.
- **N-1, N-3 and N-5:** noted. The reader's G1 and G5c, not the comparison alone, refuse inflated bounds.

## U6 plan accepted: D-U6-1 to D-U6-9; U3 grant 1c committed; U6a dispatched (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I66's U6 scoping plan** is `R/I66/u6_scoping_01/PLAN.md` (sha256 `8742d105…`; SHA256SUMS 7/7 OK; no machine paths). Records only.
- **The estimate:** U6 is about 2.5 times I61's: 19–26 h of carrier authoring, 6–9 h for the reader round and 12.5–16.5 h of review, about 15–20 h elapsed with units in parallel. It stays off the critical path, which runs through U4 G4–G6 and U3 grant 2.
- **The milestone wording, checked by ROOT.** HANDOFF_2026-10-03_TO_NEXT_ROOT:48–51 reads: "through the actual captured facade in both solver modes, under M03-INTEGRITY-MP-v2, matching its independent reference and preserving refusal/coexistence controls."
- **F-1 is consistent with it, and is recorded as a scope fact for the owner:** in the milestone domain, no product caller can deliver a successor.
  - The Direct facade is a library entry with no product caller.
  - The desktop app calls only the ordinary wrapper.
  - Headless is refused under D-2.
  
  So the first publication reaches library consumers (Rust and Python). A desktop or native witness needs native activation, which is later work.

**All nine decisions are accepted as proposed.** Each puts an accepted design into effect (D1, D2, C1 or RR) without a new numerical meaning or criterion; none is owner-reserved.
- **D-U6-1:** the Python reader's public entry runs every gate, and `_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE` gates eligibility only, as in Rust and TS. It is reviewed as a reader change.
- **D-U6-2, option (A):** `absolute_verified` and `not_covered` rows are `disclosed` in the derivative, with the reason codes `retained_precision_absolute_verified` and `retained_precision_not_covered`, admitted only in the successor branch. This follows D2 §4.9.9 and C1:162.
- **D-U6-3:** the full TypeScript carrier set in U6, tested with mocked IPC. The native witness is a stated qualification limit (F-1).
- **D-U6-4:** the 25 names and 9 paths in `R/I66/u6_scoping_01/` (COLLISIONS) are reserved for U6, and rechecked at each grant.
- **D-U6-5:** fixtures are byte-identical copies of PP's pinned successor files, checked by sha256. U3 grant 2 adds the one PP assertion that compares them with the live serializer output.
- **D-U6-6:** the successor joins the Current-admission sets. Standing, not freshness, gates every reliance, and it stays `needs_recompute` until U7.
- **D-U6-7:** the reader round (U6e) takes F5, RV79-N1, RV80-N2 and D-U6-1.
  - F5 amends checkpoint A's D6a: the readers enforce A2's exact per-case list.
  - RV78-N2 goes into U6c.
  - RV78-N1 is deferred to wider F2a, because of its re-pin cascade. It is D36-tracked and non-gating.
  - F-7, on the reader side, goes to wider F2a.
- **D-U6-8:** the stress-neutral schema and `loadReferenceOutputAvailability.ts` are reserved for U6. ROOT posts a notice on T6's work-graph row (T6 is PLANNED, not active).
- **D-U6-9:** the legacy 0.1.0 AnalysisRun wrapper refuses sources carrying `retained_precision`.

**Order (workflow §1):**
- **U6a first:** the end-to-end slice, with D-U6-1 and the fixtures. It is granted to I66 now under `BRIEFS/I66_U6A_SLICE.md`, in `WT/f2a-carriers`, branch `codex/piping-f2a-carriers-20261004`.
- **U6b–U6e fan out after the slice is verified,** under I66's ownership. Authors are assigned at that point.
- **U6f, the complete-diff review,** comes before U7.

**U3 grant 1c** is `R/I61/u3_facade_03/` (18 files OK; no machine paths). ROOT committed it as `886bef131a` and pushed it.
- **S3:** `admit` returns `(permit, report)`, and permitted outputs keep their admission report.
- **N1:** G-C follows exact-block arbitration and G-B only.
- **N6:** the staging overlay falls back typed (`W1Fallback::Staging`), with the notice.
- **N7:** the single-parse guard is strengthened.
- **ROOT's run:** PP `--lib` gave 498 passed, 1 failed (t13), 1 ignored. **I61's:** the 324-output sweep is unchanged, runner/headless is identical, and 23 of 23 mutants are killed.
- `PreparedCase::into_ordinary`'s `expect` stays; it cannot fire, and a typed version would need a split. It is optional in grant 2.
- **I65 records `admit`'s new signature in API.md §2.**
- **The U5 addendum** (`R/I61/u5_reference_01/ADDENDUM_01.md`) corrects S-1 and N-2 as ruled.
- **RV85** reviews 1c together with 1b.

The next unused IDs are I67 and RV87.

*Text repair (ROOT, 2026-10-04): this entry was first committed in `6e796235c8` with seven code names dropped by a shell-quoting error. They are restored above, and nothing else is changed.*

## RV85 on U3 grants 1b and 1c: PASS; merged into NUM (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV85's report** is `R/REVIEW_RV85/u3_facade_02/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `59d1c7ad…`; SHA256SUMS 56/56 OK; no machine paths). Verdict: **PASS** on both `4b31bbf23a` (1b) and `886bef131a` (1c), with 0 BLOCKING, 1 SHOULD-FIX and 7 NOTE findings.

**Confirmed by RV85, as their originator:**
- **S1:** the permit is linear.
- **S2:** caller-armed faults fire on the reserved-stack thread. Removing the carry brings the hazard back, and the stub catches it.
- **S3:** `admission()` is `Some` on every permitted path.
- **N1:** G-C is never reached after a G-B refusal or an exact selection.
- **N6:** a staging fault falls back typed, with the notice.
- **N7:** the stronger single-parse guard holds.

**Also established:**
- **R-1 is additive,** and no existing public signature changed. Without a permit, all 196 retained calls give `Ordinary` with the plain bytes. Under RV85's own stub, success gives `Successor` with U1's pinned bytes.
- **R-2's notice** appears only where W1 work ran (the five fallbacks plus Staging). RV85's independent expectation matched all 196 stub calls, F-1 is faithful to C1:68, and the base readers accept the real notice bytes with standing unchanged.
- **No published byte changes without a permit:**
  - the 550-row sweep is byte-identical across base, grant 1, 1b and 1c;
  - the PP outcomes equal grant 1's plus the added tests;
  - runner/headless and result_export are unchanged.

**The merge.** ROOT merged the facade branch at `886bef131a` into NUM as `a634ac8b53` with `--no-ff`. NUM's maintained source equals `886bef131a` byte for byte.

**Routing:**
- **T1 (SHOULD-FIX) → I61, as a small grant 1d now:** a test that fails if the notice's `publish` allocates, killing RV85's W01 and W02. The 196-byte reservation is correct but untested.
- **U2 → grant 1d:** unfired armed faults are handed back to the caller after the hop, not dropped silently.
- **U4 → the grant-2 brief:** after N1, the G-B check that matters is `permitted_run`'s (RV85's SV18 kills its removal), and V07 is equivalent. Grant 2's committed permit-path test targets it.
- **U1 → I65 G5, optional:** bind the permit to its invocation, and check linearity structurally, not by text.
- **U3, U5, U6 and U7:** no action. The R-2 condition still holds.

## U3 grant 1d (test-only) committed; held for grant 2's review (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I61's grant 1d** is `R/I61/u3_facade_04/` (18 files OK; no machine paths). ROOT committed it on the facade branch, on top of `886bef131a`, and pushed it.
- **T1:** the notice's `publish` is pinned to allocate nothing, by checking that capacity is unchanged; RV85's W01 and W02 are killed. `RECEIPT_ENCODING_DETAIL_MAX` is pinned to the longest token over all eleven `ReceiptCheck` values.
- **U2:** unfired armed faults are handed back to the caller across the hop, including on a spawn failure.

**ROOT read the diff.** Every `lib.rs` change is `#[cfg(test)]` or test-module code, so production code is unchanged. A production build is clean. PP `--lib` gave 499 passed, 1 failed (t13), 1 ignored. I61 killed 6 of 6 mutants.

**It is held on the facade branch,** not merged. RV85 confirms T1 and U2 as their originator in grant 2's review, and 1d merges with grant 2. Nothing in NUM depends on it.

**I61 is idle until U4 G5,** or until a U6 fan-out unit is assigned.

## U4 G4: the margin rule trips; l ≤ 128 adopted; D-6 lock record extended (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I65's G4 return** is `R/I65/u4_g4_01/` (77 files, SHA256SUMS OK; no machine paths; 15 MB, mostly reproducible JSON outputs, committed as G3's were). Records only. It covers:
- T16 publication: 1.39 GB at the caps;
- T17 precommit reader: 1.28 GB, plus 5.4 MB of statics;
- T18: the staged copy at 106 MB, the N1 reserve at 0.76 MB, and a move-only transfer;
- T19: 10 KB;
- the text work and the T24 composition per caller and mode, under the restated admission law (phases X1–W5);
- all routed repairs: RV83 R-1–R-3 and RV84 S-1–S-7, N-2, N-3, N-7, N-11 and N-13.

**The call graph is repaired.** It reaches RV83's evidence (64 of 64; 33 of 36, with the remaining 3 explained). "Never under-counts" is replaced by a stated method with its limits. **No mutual recursion** on the repaired graph: RV84's 17 candidate cycles were name collisions.

**The margin rule trips** (ε = 2, illustrative strides, D1 caps):
- the maximum is **0.9115 M (sparse) and 0.9164 M (dense)**, at W3 (branch W publication), with W4 (the precommit reader) within 10 MB of it;
- branch X is at 0.855–0.860 M;
- at the milestone's own facts the maximum is 0.084 M.

**Ruled: tighter caps, `l ≤ 128`** (primitive loads in the one case, down from 192). I65's sensitivity table (COMPOSITION_G4.md §4) gives 0.8510 M sparse and 0.8559 M dense, with D falling from 17,574 to 14,694.
- **Why this lever.** ROOT's margin ruling prefers caps as the smallest intervention: a cap edit plus a mechanical re-run. Of the two caps that give a comfortable margin, `l` costs the least coverage. The milestone has l = 3, and holding m, n and g at 32 keeps the members and nodes that the U8 Ceiling witness's numerics need (D-9).
- **Declined for now:**
  - **I65's phase-aware ordinary span (§5):** a records refinement whose per-family "dead after G-C" argument would need its own review. It is not needed to pass the rule, and stays available at G5 if in-build strides trip it.
  - **The lifetime-aware text model:** worth scheduling later, for headroom beyond D1.
  - **The per-invocation evaluator.**
- **D1's cap table** (DOMAIN.md §2) now reads `l ≤ 128`. G5's census constant follows.

**D-6, the reviewed-lock record, is extended as I65 proposed.** It also binds the hashes of the precommit reader's 13 `include_str!` static inputs, and G5 adds compile-time layout witnesses for the reader types T17 prices. A change to any of them then requires re-qualification. The PP lock sha256 at this basis is `4f494db6…475b` (37 packages, 22 from the registry); U3 did not change it.

**Also recorded:**
- D1.10 and D1.11 refuse as `source_family` and `resource_admission`, both already in the schema enum.
- RV82-N5: build flags and execution order are checked at precommit by the reader, which falls back with N1.
- U3 budgets B-1 to B-10 are met at grants 1, 1b and 1c.
- The G5 carry list is in NOTES_G4.md §5.
- The S-6 hook edits are I61's under D-5.

**Next:**
- **I65** re-runs the chain at `l ≤ 128` as a G4 addendum (`ADDENDUM_L128.md`, its outputs, and a SHA256SUMS update) and amends DOMAIN's cap row.
- **RV83** confirms R-1–R-3, which closes B-2.
- **RV84** confirms S-1–S-7 and N-3.
- **RV87 (fresh)** reviews G4 as a whole once the addendum lands.

The next unused IDs are I67 and RV87.

## U4 G4 addendum at l ≤ 128: the margin rule holds (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I65's `ADDENDUM_L128.md`** is in `R/I65/u4_g4_01/`. SHA256SUMS now covers 92 files and verifies OK, with no machine paths. No existing file changed; only 15 lines were appended.
- **At l = 128,** with everything else at the D1 caps and ε = 2, the admission maximum is **0.8510 M (sparse) and 0.8559 M (dense)**, at W3. That is 197 MB and 178 MB under the 0.9 M rule. The figure equals the sensitivity grid's l = 128 row.
- **Per phase:** W4 is 0.849 / 0.854 M, and X1 is 0.795 / 0.800 M. D is 14,694 and D_env is 9,360.
- **The G2 amendment:** DOMAIN.md §2's `l` row now reads ≤ 128. The primitive_loads capacity cap is ≤ 128, and the derived source_count is 4,768.
- **The N1 reserve** is priced conservatively, as push-growth headroom (about 1.07 MB). Grant 1b reserves exactly one slot, so G5 may tighten it to about 152 B.
- **Errata for RV87** (ADDENDUM §5): four prose counts in the sealed G4 records predate the last two rule edits. No total is affected, and the corrected values are in §5.

**RV87 is dispatched** under `BRIEFS/RV87_U4_G4_REVIEW.md`.

## RV83 on the G4 repairs: R-2 and R-3 fixed; R-1 and B-2 closed, with R-4 carried (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV83's report** is `R/REVIEW_RV83/u4_g2_03/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `f7ad7afe…`; SHA256SUMS OK; no machine paths). Its earlier packets re-verify.

**Fixed:**
- **R-2:** `validate_profile` is priced at 25.6 MB of text volume, a loose but sound upper bound.
- **R-3:** the O-N provenance parse is priced at 48,000 B, and RV83 checked that it bounds any ≤ 128-byte non-object parse.
- **R-1's two reported classes:**
  - generic receivers: 24 calls hiding 64 functions before, 0 now;
  - dropped reachable edges: 15 before, 0 now.
  
  formation_check.rs is now reached and priced.

**B-2's criterion is met:** every text site on the D1 call graph is covered by a stated bound or a correct exclusion.

**R-4 (SHOULD-FIX, new):** the extractor's stated limits are still inaccurate.
- 24 calls to the enclosing impl's own methods produce no edge: locals or parameters typed `Self`, and a self-call inside index brackets.
- The audit mislabels them "std/external".
- **The effect is nil:** the true targets hold no text, no cycle closes, and only two non-recursive functions (structural_adapter.rs:1204 and :1217) stay unreached.

**Ruled:** R-4 is a carry-over to I65, as a records item delivered with G5's return.
- Resolve `Self`-typed receivers to the enclosing impl, and stop the receiver pattern at `[`.
- Correct limit 5 and the audit labels.
- Re-run TEXT and the recursion inventory, and confirm both are unchanged apart from the two functions.

It moves no figure and does not gate G5's code. **R-1 and B-2 are closed as confirmed.** RV83 checks R-4 at G5's return.

## RV84 confirms its G3 findings in G4 (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV84's confirmation** is `R/REVIEW_RV84/u4_g3_02/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `46f3c334…`; SHA256SUMS 13/13 OK; no machine paths). Verdict: **CONFIRMED**, with 0 BLOCKING, 0 SHOULD-FIX and 5 NOTE findings.
- **S-1 to S-7 and N-3 are fixed,** each checked with RV84's own probes against source at G4's basis.
- **N-3:** all 17 of RV84's candidate cycles were checked, not a sample. Each resolves to std or to a distinct method. All 22 self-loops are genuine (19 reachable) and bounded.
- **S-5:** the maximum covers X1, X2 and W1–W5, traced through caller completion. Failure exits are prefixes.

**NOTEs, routed:**
- **To G5 (I65):**
  - C-N1: two longest-string figures in the hash route, about 0.3 MB;
  - C-N2: the per-term `dof` numbers, about 1.6 MB, absorbed;
  - C-N3(a): T19's thread-spawn heap belongs in X1 and W1–W4;
  - C-N3(c): the unused `RECEIPT_X`;
  - C-N4: the `retained_error_text_bytes` owners;
  - C-N5: the wording.
- **C-N3(b),** whether the reader's process-lifetime statics (5.4 MB) count against M in every phase after the first permitted invocation: **ruled conservatively.** They are counted in every phase from G5 onward, and the G6 record states it. That is about 0.13% of M.

**The G3 review cycle is closed.** RV87's review of G4's new terms is still running.

## U6a verified and committed; fan-out (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I66's U6a** is `R/I66/u6a_slice_01/` (RETURN sha256 `543b761e…`; SHA256SUMS 30/30 OK; no machine paths). ROOT committed it as `844448112f` on `codex/piping-f2a-carriers-20261004` and pushed it.

**ROOT's verification:**
- **The removed lines, read by ROOT:**
  - the Python public entry's G0 completeness `_need` is removed, as D-U6-1 rules. Eligibility is still `_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE and …` (retained_precision.py:1702), with the flag false, matching Rust's `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE` (RS:4260, :4300);
  - the derivative's disposition block now also discloses rows that carry a class disclosure. Nothing is narrowed.
- **The fixtures** are byte-identical to PP's pinned successors (`ac6986b0…`, `6cd1d249…`).
- **ROOT's runs** (default toolchain): result_export gave **159/159** (the 149 existing plus 10 new), and the Python reader contract tests gave **362/362**.
- **I66's evidence:**
  - a 63-envelope existing-identity sweep, unchanged against base, with one base-variant exception (F1);
  - runner/headless identical;
  - PP's pin tests 35/35 against the new result_export;
  - the slice byte-equal and revalidating in all three readers;
  - 62/62 mutants killed.

**Findings:**
- **F1:** the source-blocks validator's first error code varies between runs on the two `rejected_stress_range` fixtures, at base too. It refuses either way. This is a determinism defect outside T3's fence; it is flagged as a separate task for its owner, and does not gate U6.
- **F2:** `results.v0.3` refuses the derivatives until U6c adds the two `RowDisclosure` codes. **U6c lands before anything schema-validates a successor export.**
- **F3:** `not_covered` is tested only through the class seams, because no available statement has such a row. It is a stated limit, revisited when a witness supplies one.
- **F4:** `SOURCE_PREVIEW_PHYSICS_RETAINED_TABLE_HASH` and `SOURCE_PREVIEW_PHYSICS_RETAINED_TABLE_IDENTITY` are **reserved** for U6.
- **F5 (fail-closed):** a refused statement makes binding refuse every row with `RULE_QUANTITY_NOT_COVERED`. This is accepted, subject to RV88.
- **F6:** the class-disclosure message is new product text, for RV88 to review.
- **F7:** 2–4 revalidations per carrier call. A U6f cost note; carriers are outside W1's admission.

**The fan-out** (`BRIEFS/U6_FANOUT_COMMON.md`):
- **I66 (owner):** U6c, the schemas (F2 first), then U6b, Python carriers including D-U6-9. Work in `WT/f2a-carriers`, on top of `844448112f`.
- **I67 (new):** U6d, TypeScript, under `BRIEFS/I67_U6D_TYPESCRIPT.md`, in `WT/f2a-carriers-ts`. This is the longest chain.
- **I61:** U6e, the reader round (F5, RV79-N1, RV80-N2; snapshot 07g), under `BRIEFS/I61_U6E_READER_ROUND.md`, in `WT/f2a-readers-round`, until U4 G5 returns.
- **RV88 (new):** the standing U6 reviewer, under `BRIEFS/RV88_U6_STANDING_REVIEW.md`, starting with U6a.

Branches merge into the carriers branch after review. U6f, a fresh complete-diff review, precedes U7. The next unused IDs are I68 and RV89.

## RV87 on U4 G4: PASS; the margin holds; routing to G5 (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV87's report** is `R/REVIEW_RV87/u4_g4_01/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `8af30f77…`; SHA256SUMS 9/9 OK; no machine paths). Verdict: **PASS**, with 0 BLOCKING, 5 SHOULD-FIX and 8 NOTE findings.

**What RV87 established independently:**
- **Its stdlib model reproduces the packet byte for byte** under the packet's counting rules: every phase X1, X2 and W1–W5, in both modes, at l = 128 and l = 192.
- **With its corrections, the maximum at `l ≤ 128` is W3:**
  - 0.8544 M sparse and 0.8593 M dense;
  - 0.8568 / 0.8617 M with S-2's text added;
  - that is **about 164–184 MB under 0.9 M,** and 567–586 MB under M.
- **Sensitivity:** strides carry about 9% of the maximum, and a ±10% stride error moves it by about ±31 MB. With +10% strides and S-2, the dense maximum is 0.8695 M, still 123 MB under the rule.
- **At l = 192 the corrected figure is 0.9200 M,** so the trip, and the `l ≤ 128` ruling, stand.
- **Also confirmed:**
  - T16's hash route and growth;
  - T17's peak;
  - the 13 reader statics, whose hashes match ORIGINS, and which are the only `include_str!` inputs `validate` reaches;
  - the fallback, transfer and completion terms, and B-1;
  - 27 text sites, and the four errata;
  - the lock re-pin;
  - that API_G4's hook additions compile as specified.

**Routed to I65, inside G5,** for the constants, the expressions and the records:
- **S-1:** T16 misses a third copy of `run_v` and `selection_v`, which stay alive through `finish()` (PP/retained_wire.rs:1540, :1549, :1551–1555): 13.25 MB at the publication peak.
- **S-2:** six result-id copies are priced in the 128-B identifier class, but result ids can reach 1,024 B: PP/lib.rs:2728, :2730, :2738 and :5292 (twice), and preview_physics.rs:194. Up to 9.75 MB per branch. I65 owns the T08 text classes; RV83 and RV84 confirm it at G5's review.
- **S-3:** API_G4 §1's `admit` signature is corrected to `(CapturePermit, RetainedAdmissionReport)` (already in G5's brief).
- **S-4:** `LateFacts` passes slices, but the `restrained_capacity` and `springs_capacity` facts need capacities. Either pass the owning `Vec`s by reference at the D-5-excepted site, or bound them from census facts. Separately, G-C's `capture.P1_old_source` is a row label; name the field.
- **S-5:** the G5 carry list gains three items:
  - RV85's U1, optionally binding the permit to its invocation and checking linearity structurally;
  - the `l = 128` census constant;
  - RV83's B-3/S-5 test that the compiled identity carries every key in order.
- **NOTEs N-1 to N-8:** I65's discretion within G5. N-3 suggests G-C check the longest-string atoms; N-4 notes a 0.22 GB over-count lever, available but not needed.

**The G4 review cycle is closed.** G5 is running.

## U4 G5 part 1 verified and committed; I65's four decisions; part 2 granted (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I65's part 1** is `R/I65/u4_g5_01/` (SHA256SUMS 39/39 OK; no machine paths). ROOT committed it as `1e323058f3` on `codex/piping-f2a-memory-20261004` (from `8abb5274a9`) and pushed it.

**ROOT's verification:**
- **The production diff, read by ROOT:**
  - the two authorized struct-construction edits are the only changes to `lib.rs` and `retained_product.rs` (`CompleteFacts{…, capture: &observer}`, `LateFacts{…, capture: &*self}`);
  - `build.rs` never fails the build: any read failure gives `v1;unavailable`, and it adds no build-dependency;
  - `REGISTERED_PROFILES` is the empty slice `&[]`, and `admission()` constructs a permit only from a registered index with no refusal. The bound is `Unpriced` until part 2. **So no permit can be constructed, in two independent ways** (decision 7).
- **ROOT's run** (default toolchain): PP `--lib` gave 522 passed, 1 failed (t13), 1 ignored, with 23 new tests.
- **The production build** emits a one-line identity (`v1;rustc.release=1.97.1;…;target=aarch64-apple-darwin;…`) and the reviewed-input hashes. The PP lock hash is `4f494db6…`, matching G4's record.
- **I65's evidence:**
  - the 324-line fixture sweep is byte-identical to base, including every public admission-report field;
  - PP is base plus 23 tests, and runner/headless is identical;
  - 83 of 84 mutants are killed. The survivor (`build_status` ignoring bindings) is unobservable while nothing is registered.

**I65's decisions, ruled:**
1. **The reviewed-lock record, accepted as built:** build-time hashing with the self-contained SHA-256. It is tested against `sha2`, it adds no Cargo manifest dependency, and it only gates fail-closed: a wrong hash gives `Stale`. RV89 verifies it independently against `sha2`, on the NIST vectors and the padding edges.
2. **RV87 S-4, the restrained and springs capacities: accepted as built.** G-B reads lengths through the slices, and O prices the capacities by construction law from those lengths. No hook change for I61.
3. **The late capture as its own fact: not added.** G-C's adapter capacity tally measures it after it is made. That meets S-6(c)'s intent without a new observer field outside the fence.
4. **R-4's remaining limit: accepted as stated.** A name rebound with a different type within one function body can lose calls. At this basis those calls carry no text and close no cycle. The general fix over-approximates to 3.26 GB with an incomplete text run, so it is not adopted for D1. RV83 confirms the R-4 record.

**Also recorded:**
- **The API correction (RV87 S-3):** `admit` returns `Result<(CapturePermit, RetainedAdmissionReport), RetainedAdmissionReport>`.
- **The N1 reserve** is tightened to grant 1b's exact reservation, about 0.9 KB.

**Part 2 is granted.** It covers:
- the cap-priced constants as in-build expressions, with the FK resource module;
- RV84's C-N1(b), C-N2 and C-N3, and RV87's S-1, S-2, N-1 and N-2;
- the witness tests W1–W7 at R/16, and the allocation challenge;
- carry items 3, 8 and 11;
- RV85 U1, optional.

**Review:** RV89 (fresh) reviews part 1 now under `BRIEFS/RV89_U4_G5_REVIEW.md`, and part 2 when it lands. RV83 confirms R-4 and RV87's S-2 at part 2.

The next unused IDs are I68 and RV90.

## U6e (the reader round) verified and committed; RV90 dispatched (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I61's U6e** is `R/I61/u6e_reader_round_01/` (SHA256SUMS 19/19 OK; no machine paths). ROOT committed it as `5e1e2625ac` on `codex/piping-f2a-readers-round-20261004` (from `844448112f`) and pushed it.

**ROOT's verification:**
- **The removed lines, read by ROOT:**
  - D6a's "need not name the case" comments are removed. D6a's unique-and-resolve check is **kept**, and F5's exact-list check is **added** in all three readers.
  - TypeScript's D37 check moved, unchanged, into the helper `errorStageRecordAgrees`, which `productAttempts` calls.
  - The two flipped tests (Rust, TS) asserted 07f's relaxed rule; they now assert F5's refusal, which is the ruled change.
  - The count pins go from 268 to 274.
- **ROOT's runs** (default toolchain): result_export gave **163/163** (+4), and the Python contract tests **372/372** (+10). The corpus sha256 is `aa8e930e…`, as recorded.

**I61's evidence:**
- TS vitest 444 (+8) and `tsc` 0;
- 0 outcome changes from 07f, other than the 6 new F5 mutations;
- the milestone receipts still give 25/69/3/1 and 25/69/3/2, with standing `needs_recompute`;
- 22 of 22 mutants killed.

**What it contains:**
- **F5:** the readers enforce A2's exact per-case list, which kills U1's M09 and M10 at the readers (M20 at G6). The 15 corpus bases were repaired: only `diagnostic_refs` and the receipt hash changed, and each repair is listed.
- **RV79-N1:** a D37 table derived from native source alone, pinned as the corpus's `d37`, from which every reader's D37 test now takes its expectations. This is a U7 condition. RV79's M35 and M37 are killed.
- **RV80-N2:** `integral_receipt`'s receipt-only scope is pinned in Rust and Python.

**Review:** a fresh **RV90** reviews U6e under `BRIEFS/RV90_U6E_READER_ROUND_REVIEW.md`, including an independent derivation of the D37 table.

**I61 is idle until U4 G5 part 2 returns.** Then it takes U3 grant 2.

The next unused IDs are I68 and RV91.

## U6c returned with a stop: three pin tests broken since the reader fan-in (a ROOT miss); ruled (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I66's U6c** (the successor carrier schemas) is `R/I66/u6c_schemas_01/` (RETURN sha256 `e8741c47…`; SHA256SUMS 21/21 OK; no machine paths). It is uncommitted in `WT/f2a-carriers`.
- **D-U6-2's two `RowDisclosure` codes** are admitted only in the successor branch of `results.v0.3`.
- **The AnalysisRun and stress-neutral successor branches** are added, and each existing branch refuses `retained_precision`.
- **RV78-N2's probes Y0–Y11** become 25 new schema tests.
- **Controls:** 49 committed documents give the same verdict under base and candidate schemas; U6a's derivatives validate; 26 of 26 mutants are killed.

**The stop, and ROOT's error.** Three existing pin tests fail on NUM, and have failed since the reader fan-in at `c15e64b756`, which appended the eighth (successor) `results.v0.3` branch. ROOT confirmed this on NUM HEAD:
- `tests/test_load_reference_schema.py::test_carrier_branches_are_appended_after_the_existing_methods`;
- `tests/test_load_reference_source_schema.py::test_joined_branches_are_appended_with_pinned_identities`;
- `tests/test_source_block_schema_contract.py::test_actual_composite_maximum_metadata_has_a_method_scoped_canonical_route`.

**ROOT's acceptance runs for the fan-in, and since, covered only the retained-precision contract tests, so the regression went unseen.**
- **Corrected from now on:** for any schema, reader or carrier change, ROOT's acceptance runs include I66's 24-file schema sweep (`R/I66/u6c_schemas_01/_run_records/sweep_test_files.txt`), together with the full result_export and analysis_runs suites.
- The fan-in record is not rewritten. This entry is its correction.

**Ruled:**
- **The pins follow the accepted design.** D2 §4.9.6 and C1:162 have T3's successor branch appended after T1's. The tests pinned the pre-F2a count (7) and "T1's entries are last".
- **I66's 78-line patch** (`_run_records/proposed_pin_tests.diff`) removes no assertion and weakens none. Each "last entry" pin becomes a stricter "last two entries" pin (T1's, then the successor), and the count becomes 8.
- **U6c's fence is extended to those three test files, for exactly that patch.** I66 applies it and runs the 24-file sweep. RV88 reviews it as a pin update together with U6c.
- **T1 and T0R are COMPLETE** (merged to main as PR963 and PR952), so no active loop is affected.

**Other findings:**
- **F-U6c-1:** adopted, as above.
- **F-U6c-2,** which predates T3's F2a work (since T0R): the dispatcher `schemas/results.schema.yaml`'s v0.3 branch knows only precision-1, so it refuses every newer v0.3 identity, including preview-physics-1, physics-1 and the successor. Every v0.3 test validates against `results.v0.3.schema.yaml` directly. **Routed to T6** (PLANNED), via its work-graph row.
- **F-U6c-3:** whether T6 ever emits successor packages is T6's question. The stress-neutral successor branch admits the transport shape only, and the Python packager still refuses it.

## U6d (TypeScript carriers) verified and committed; S-1 ruled (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I67's U6d** is `R/I67/u6d_typescript_01/` (RETURN sha256 `54121176…`; SHA256SUMS 42/42 OK; no machine paths). ROOT committed it, with the S-1 test patch, as `9555b6ffc2` on `codex/piping-f2a-carriers-ts-20261004` (from `844448112f`) and pushed it. The local `node_modules` link and the copied WASM assets are not committed.

**S-1, ruled:** the existing pin test `knownSemanticLimitations.test.ts:46–50` asserts the exact fresh-identity set, and D-U6-6 adds the successor to it. The fence is extended to I67's 3-line patch, which adds the ruled id and keeps exact equality, as U6a did for Rust's pin. ROOT applied it at commit.

**ROOT's verification:**
- **The removed lines, read by ROOT:** they are rewrites that extend each function to the successor route.
  - `NUMERICAL_CASE_EVIDENCE_INCOMPLETE`'s condition moved, unchanged in logic, into the exported `ordinaryCaseEligible` (its De Morgan form).
  - `SOURCE_NUMERICAL_CONTRACT_UNSUPPORTED` stays; the downgrade guard adds a more specific code. Nothing is narrowed.
- **ROOT's runs:** desktop Vitest **3,417/3,417** (138 files), and `tsc --noEmit` clean.
- **I67's evidence:**
  - base 3,258 tests, all unchanged apart from the S-1 pin;
  - 159 new tests;
  - 63 existing-identity envelopes identical to base across 17 carrier outcomes;
  - the 14 parity cases agree with Rust U6a;
  - 103 of 103 mutants killed, the last six by added tests. One equivalent guard (K24) in new code was removed.

**Findings:**
- **F1:** an unregistered invalid successor reads `needs_recompute` in TS, but `unsupported` in Rust and Python. Neither is ever eligible. **A declared parity difference, for RV88 and U6f to judge.**
- **F2 and F6:** RV88 reviews the display-only binding precheck and the new product text.
- **F3:** PP's pinned request model is not a complete desktop model. A native witness will need a desktop-shaped request. This goes to the native-activation scope.
- **F4:** a header-only stress-neutral packet cannot carry the receipt, and fails closed. Noted for T6.
- **F5:** ComparisonPanel shows the successor's dimension as unknown. Display only; noted for T6.
- **F7:** the new names are recorded under D-U6-4 (COLLISIONS.json). All are absent from committed trees, apart from the deliberate reuse of U6a's `PREVIEW_PHYSICS_RETAINED_PROFILE`.
- **F8, F9 and F10:** noted.

**RV88** reviews U6d after U6a (the standing U6 reviewer).

## RV89 on U4 G5 part 1: PASS; routing into part 2 (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV89's report** is `R/REVIEW_RV89/u4_g5_01/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `9af26f9f…`; SHA256SUMS 106/106 OK; no machine paths). Verdict: **PASS** on `1e323058f3`, with 0 BLOCKING, 1 SHOULD-FIX and 6 NOTE findings.

**What RV89 established independently:**
- **No permit can exist:**
  - `REGISTERED_PROFILES` is `&[]`;
  - `admission()` is the only constructor;
  - there is no test permit and no `unsafe`;
  - the bound is `Unpriced`, and the gate bounds are 0. G-B and G-C refuse the milestone in both modes.
- **Nothing published changes:** a 4,022-line sweep (71 inputs × 2 modes × 5 routes, with every public admission-report field) is byte-identical to base. PP, runner/headless and result_export outcomes equal base apart from the 23 new tests.
- **D1.0–D1.11 match DOMAIN.md as amended.** Through G-A, the cap+1 value refuses for 20 facts, and the D1.10 and D1.11 edges behave as derived.
- **Allocation-free:** G-A, the census extensions and both gate checks perform 0 allocations, with a positive control.
- **D-6:**
  - the SHA-256 matches `sha2` and the NIST vectors on 3,270 inputs, including the padding edges;
  - the escaping round-trips every byte and byte pair, and 400 hostile identities forge no key;
  - `build.rs` exits 0 under 12 crafted environments;
  - the 14 reviewed-input hashes equal G4's ORIGINS.
- **The bounds:** G-C's longest-string bounds are exact, and the bound arithmetic is checked, with M−1, M and M+1 correct.
- **Mutants:** I65's 84 reproduce exactly. RV89's own 24 are all accounted for.

**Routed to part 2 (I65):**
- **S-1 (tests only):** four D1 weakenings survive I65's tests:
  - V03: D1.3's expansion-law check weakened from "any" to "all";
  - V06: Σ restraint capacity read as the per-support maximum;
  - V07 and V08: the typed walk skips request-level materials, or temperature-point ids.
  
  Add tests that kill them, and re-run them.
- **N-2:** add tests that kill V17 (an overflowed gate sum must saturate, not read 0) and V24 (the longest-string fact must cover `affected_refs`).
- **N-4, ruled as a code guard:** `bindings_hold` gets the same `=unavailable` refusal as `identity_match`, so that a build that cannot read a reviewed input is `Stale` by construction. A G6 process check would rely on a later step to catch it. This is inside U4's fence.
- **N-3:** accepted. The compiler identity pins std's entry-tuple layouts. Part 2 may record them, but does not have to.
- **N-1:** I65's tally is restated as 81 behavioural kills, 2 text pins and 1 equivalent.
- **N-5:** the private `law` field is included in the derived `Debug` and `PartialEq` only. Noted.
- **N-6:** R4_CALLGRAPH §2's load_ledger.rs:131 wording; the totals are unchanged.

**RV89 keeps its build caches** (WT/targets/rv89) for part 2, and deletes them after part 2's review.

## U6c (schemas) with the pin repair verified and committed (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I66 applied the ruled pin patch.** Its hunks are identical to the 78-line proposal, and nothing is removed. The addendum is `R/I66/u6c_schemas_01/ADDENDUM_01.md` (SHA256SUMS 26/26 OK; no machine paths).

ROOT committed U6c as `cb03315779` on `codex/piping-f2a-carriers-20261004`, on top of `844448112f`, and pushed it. It changes seven files: the three schemas, `test_retained_precision_schema.py`, and the three pin tests.

**ROOT's verification:**
- **The removed lines, read by ROOT:**
  - in the schemas, only list-ending lines, rewritten to take the appended entries;
  - in the pin tests, the "last entry" and count-7 pins, replaced by stricter "last two entries" and count-8 pins.
- **ROOT ran the 24-file schema sweep plus the retained schema test,** as ROOT's acceptance runs now require, in the worktree: **1,785 passed, 30 skipped, 0 failed.** That equals I66's count. The three pin tests that failed on NUM since the fan-in now pass.

**Review:** RV88 reviews U6c, with the pin patch, after U6a and U6d.

**Next:** I66 starts U6b, the Python carriers including D-U6-9.

## RV90 on U6e: PASS; a repair round (snapshot 07h) granted (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV90's report** is `R/REVIEW_RV90/u6e_reader_round_01/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `186b2235…`; SHA256SUMS 55/55 OK; no machine paths). Verdict: **PASS** on `5e1e2625ac`, with 0 BLOCKING, 1 SHOULD-FIX and 4 NOTE findings.

**What RV90 established independently:**
- **F5 matches A2** in all three readers: the same gate and code (G5 ATTEMPT), class 2 and position.
- **Both milestone receipts pass all six readers** (base and candidate) and reseal to identical bytes. No legitimate producer output is refused.
- **All 15 base repairs** change only `diagnostic_refs` and the receipt hash.
- **RV90's own D37 derivation matches the corpus** on all 9 kinds and 25 records. Perturbing the corpus table fails exactly each reader's D37 test.
- **RV80-N2 holds.**
- **Outcomes:** 0 of 305 07f outcomes change, and only the 6 F5 mutations differ.
- **Suites:** Python 384, Rust 163 and TS 444, with `tsc` 0. The flags are still false.

**S1 (SHOULD-FIX), a parity regression in the check under review.** Python's F5 test, `name in (d.get("affected_refs") or [])` (PY:914), treats a non-array `affected_refs` (a string, a number or an object) differently from Rust (`list()`) and TS (`Array.isArray`). On 6 malformed probes, the candidate readers diverge, with Python the odd one out every time; the base readers agree. Every version refuses these inputs, so eligibility cannot change. **Ruled: repair now.** The readers' first-failure parity is the accepted standard, and the fix is one line.

**N1 and N2 (test-only gaps on the eligible path):**
- **N1:** no shared entry pins F5 on a case after the first.
- **N2:** no shared entry pins a strict-prefix list.

Mutants that weaken F5 in each way survive all three suites. **Ruled: add the shared mutations now,** in the same round, rather than as a later U7 condition, because F5 sits on the eligible path.

**N3:** Rust's flipped probe does not isolate F5; the shared m10 entry covers it. Sharpening it is optional.

**N4:** add the facade-order premise to the corpus `d37.basis`: `freeze_candidate` runs only after `solve_native` succeeds (PP/lib.rs:2962–2974).

**A wording slip:** I61's RETURN §3 says 197 tests kill Python's M50 analogue; the record gives 130.

**I61: the U6e repair round, snapshot 07h,** in `WT/f2a-readers-round` on top of `5e1e2625ac`:
- S1's Python fix, plus one shared mutation;
- N1's and N2's shared mutations;
- N4's basis wording;
- N3, optionally;
- the RETURN §3 count.

All three readers must pass 07h. No 07g outcome may change except through the new entries. RV90 confirms. The next unused IDs are I68 and RV91.

## U6b (Python carriers) verified and committed; the pin and findings ruled (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I66's U6b** is `R/I66/u6b_python_01/` (RETURN sha256 `e1619218…`; SHA256SUMS 27/27 OK; no machine paths). ROOT committed it, with the pin patch, as `c89a7a986c` on `codex/piping-f2a-carriers-20261004` (on top of U6c) and pushed it.

**The stop, ruled:** `tests/test_preview_physics_consumer_contract.py::test_table_identity_and_registry` pins `FRESH_CONTRACT_IDS` exactly, and D-U6-6 adds the successor. The fence is extended to I66's 3-line patch (an import, the ruled id, and a comment), which keeps exact equality, as for Rust and TS. ROOT applied it.

**ROOT's verification:**
- **The removed lines, read by ROOT:** three inline allow-lists are replaced by the named `CURRENT_RECORD_CONTRACT_IDS`, which equals the old seven plus the successor. The v0.2 builder's forbidden-member list gains `retained_precision` only.
- **ROOT's acceptance sweep,** in the worktree: the 24 files, plus the retained schema and new carrier tests, gave **1,806 passed, 30 skipped, 0 failed**. That is I66's 1,805 plus the pin test.
- **I66's evidence:**
  - 5 other Python consumers unchanged (428);
  - 62 documents × 11 carrier outcomes, unchanged on the 60 non-successors;
  - 19 of 21 new tests fail at base;
  - 59 of 60 mutants killed (S04 is equivalent).

**Findings:**
- **F-U6b-2:** the Python reader has no transport validator, so a transported successor fails closed with `SOURCE_PRODUCER_CONTRACT_UNSUPPORTED`. Its only caller, T6's packager, refuses successors anyway. **Tracked to wider F2a,** before T6 admits successor packages. It does not gate the milestone.
- **F-U6b-3, accepted:** `build_analysis_run_v0_2` now refuses `retained_precision`, rather than silently dropping it. **TS alignment is routed to U6d's repair round,** after RV88's U6d review.
- **F-U6b-4:** the plan text said the 0.1.0 wrapper "accepts any source"; it already refused both milestones. Noted.
- **I67's F1** is unchanged in Python; RV88 and U6f judge it.

**Limits:** the fixtures are single-case producer outputs (D-U6-5). The post-U7 summary and eligibility are tested through the internal helper with eligibility forced. U7 or U9 reruns them on live output.

**RV88** reviews U6b after U6a, U6d and U6c. All four carrier units are now committed; U6e's 07h round is in verification.

## U6e repair round (snapshot 07h) verified and committed; RV90 confirms (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I61's repair round** is `R/I61/u6e_reader_round_02/` (SHA256SUMS 29/29 OK; no machine paths), plus the count correction `R/I61/u6e_reader_round_01/ADDENDUM_01.md`. ROOT committed it as `cc4dd61d67` on `codex/piping-f2a-readers-round-20261004`, on top of `5e1e2625ac`, and pushed it.

**What it does:**
- **S1:** Python's F5 uses `isinstance(…, list) and name in …`, as in Rust and TS. There is a new shared mutation, plus a Python-local test for the string, number and object forms.
- **N1 and N2:** shared mutations for F5 on a case after the first, and for a strict-prefix list, with a must-pass control (`f5_envelope_reordered_exact_list`).
- **N4:** the facade-order premise is added to `d37.basis`.
- **N3:** Rust's D6a probe now isolates its defect.

**Snapshot 07h:** 15 cases, 277 mutations, 23 must-pass entries; sha256 `d0a4ee21…`. Rust and TS reader code is byte-unchanged.

**ROOT's verification:**
- **The removed lines, read by ROOT:** only the old Python predicate (replaced by the stricter one), the count pins, and the sharpened Rust probe.
- **ROOT's runs:** result_export **164/164**. The 24-file sweep plus the retained schema and contract tests: **1,774 passed, 30 skipped and 3 failed.** The 3 are exactly the branch-order pins broken since the reader fan-in, which U6c repaired on the carriers branch (`cb03315779`). This branch predates U6c, so they fail here and resolve when the branches merge. There are no new failures.
- **I61's evidence:**
  - Python 391, Rust 164, TS 448, `tsc` 0;
  - parity on all 277 mutations, 23 must-pass entries and 15 bases;
  - no 07g outcome change except the 4 new entries;
  - 14 of 14 mutants killed, including each of RV90's six survivors, by exactly its new entry.

**RV90 confirms S1, N1–N4 and the count correction.**

## RV90 confirms U6e's 07h round; U6e merged into the carriers branch (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV90's confirmation** is `R/REVIEW_RV90/u6e_reader_round_02/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `64bcbbb2…`; SHA256SUMS 29/29 OK; no machine paths). Verdict: **CONFIRMED**, with 0 BLOCKING, 0 SHOULD-FIX and 0 NOTE findings. S1, N1, N2, N3, N4 and the count correction are all fixed.
- RV90's 6 malformed probes agree at the gate across all three 07h readers, and the typed-integrity probe agrees too.
- Each of RV90's surviving mutants is killed by exactly its new shared entry.
- 0 of 311 07g outcomes change, and every reader matches all 315 07h entries.
- The milestone receipts and the flags are unchanged.

**Optional hardening, not ruled necessary:** shared entries for S1's number and object forms. They are pinned in Python's own test, and Rust and TS already agree. Tracked for U6f's discretion.

**The merge.** ROOT merged `codex/piping-f2a-readers-round-20261004` (`cc4dd61d67`) into `codex/piping-f2a-carriers-20261004` with `--no-ff` and pushed it. The merge is clean: the U6e and U6a–U6c files are disjoint, and the three readers and the corpus equal `cc4dd61d67` byte for byte. **The carriers branch now holds U6a, U6b, U6c and U6e,** and U6d is on its own branch. It merges into NUM after RV88's and RV91's reviews and the U6f complete review.

**Next:** RV88 (U6a, U6c, U6b) and RV91 (U6d), then U6f, a fresh complete-diff review with the three-language parity table.

## U4 G5 part 2 verified and committed; in-build maximum 0.889 M; G6 granted (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I65's part 2** is `R/I65/u4_g5_01/part2/` (SHA256SUMS 63/63 OK; part 1's seal still verifies; no machine paths). ROOT committed it as `cba3e9fda7` on `codex/piping-f2a-memory-20261004`, on top of `1e323058f3`, and pushed it. All seven changed-file hashes match I65's record, and no job of I65's was running at commit.

**The in-build maximum** (debug test build, rustc 1.97.1, aarch64-apple-darwin; at W3):
- **0.8843 M sparse** (3,560,829,770 B), 63.0 MB under 0.9 M;
- **0.8892 M dense** (3,580,540,218 B), 43.3 MB under 0.9 M.

The margin rule holds. The dense margin is narrower than G4's estimate, mainly because RV87's S-2 matched 16 result-id sites (+71.9 MB), not 6. The 42 remaining Estimate atoms weigh 6.05 MB in total.

**ROOT's verification:**
- **The removed production lines, read by ROOT:** they are `Unpriced` and `UNPRICED` placeholders, replaced by the generated profile.
  - `bindings_hold` is **stricter**: any `=unavailable` input refuses (RV89 N-4).
  - `cap_priced_maximum` returns `Unpriced` while `profile::ESTIMATES != 0`.
  - `REGISTERED_PROFILES` is still `&[]`.
  - **So no permit is constructible, in two independent ways.**
- **ROOT's runs** (default toolchain):
  - PP `--lib` gave 531 passed, 1 failed (t13), 9 ignored;
  - the isolated allocation challenge passes;
  - **all eight stack witnesses pass at R/16** (W1, W2, W2b, W3, W4, W6, W7 and the 1 MiB headroom witness);
  - FK and SR build.
- **I65's evidence:** the sweep is byte-identical to base; runner, FK and SR outcomes are unchanged; lib warnings are 8, as at base; 146 of 148 mutants are killed, and both survivors are recorded.

**I65's decisions, ruled:**
1. **The pinned profile-record test is kept, gated on build identity.** It asserts the printed table only when `COMPILED_IDENTITY` equals the pinned identity, and otherwise reports that it skipped. That keeps the 4 profile mutants killed on the qualification host without failing on other hosts. I65 makes the gate in G6.
2. **N-6 is recorded as an erratum in part 2,** not as an edit to part 1's sealed R4_CALLGRAPH.md. Records are append-only.

**Accepted as stated:**
- **RV85 U1** (binding the permit to its invocation) is not done. The permit is linear by type, and a structural invocation binding needs `lib.rs`. I61 may add it in U3 grant 2 if it is cheap; otherwise it goes to wider F2a.
- **Carry 8 is partial.** The 1 MiB headroom witness passes on the milestone, which is 4 times the R/16 witness margin. Confirming the deepest `$ref` chain (36) needs reader instrumentation outside the fence. It is a stated limit of the S1 evidence for D1, recorded in G6's record.

**Reviews:**
- **RV89** reviews part 2.
- **RV87** confirms its S-2 (16 sites against 6; `text_p2/`).
- **RV83** confirms R-4's text run.

**G6 is granted to I65** under `BRIEFS/I65_U4_G6_QUALIFICATION.md`. The registration step waits for RV89's part-2 PASS.

## RV91 on U6d: PASS; the U6d repair round granted; U7 preconditions added (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV91's report** is `R/REVIEW_RV91/u6d_01/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `67c7155f…`; SHA256SUMS 38/38 OK; no machine paths). Verdict: **PASS** on `9555b6ffc2`, with 0 BLOCKING, 1 SHOULD-FIX and 5 NOTE findings.

**What RV91 established independently:**
- **Existing behaviour unchanged.** Vitest gave base 3,258 and candidate 3,417, with `tsc` clean. RV91's own 69-envelope sweep is identical to base on all 25 outcomes.
- **Registration is bound to the exact bytes:** 8 kinds of edit each void it, and an edit made while the reader awaits does not register.
- **Standing never reads `numerical_quality`.**
- **Parity:** all 14 shared cases agree (TS 14/14, Python 14/14), and registered TS binding and summaries equal Python's row for row (98/98, 99/99).
- **Every guard and refusal code is as ruled;** all T6 surfaces refuse.
- **The S-1 pin patch keeps exact equality.**
- **New text:** D2's texts appear verbatim. The printed bound was never below b on 25,017 values.
- **Merge preview:** the carriers branch plus U6d gives 3,429/3,429.

**Rulings:**
- **I67's F1 is accepted as a declared parity difference.** An unregistered invalid successor reads `needs_recompute` in TS, but `unsupported` in Rust and Python.
  - It fails closed, and the accepted plan's §3 rule 1 prescribes it.
  - Because the expectation differs by language, it is pinned in TS's own test, not in the shared case file. U6f's three-language parity table records it.
- **SF-1 → the U6d repair round:** TS's `buildAnalysisRunV02` (analysisRunCompatibility.ts:79) must refuse a legacy-shaped source carrying a `retained_precision` member (object or null) or W1 token rows. It is the TS twin of I66's F-U6b-3, and the scope is confirmed.
- **N-3 → the repair round:** add tests that kill RV08 (the successor selected by route, not producer id, in `ruleBindingRefusal`) and RV09 (the registration fingerprint taken after the reader's await).
- **N-4 → the repair round:** the standing text must show "Selected cases: n of m" only from a validated registration.
- **N-2, a U7 precondition:** after U7, TS successor standing must be tied to the live native registration and to the model. Today every consumer also checks `hasNativeMechanicsInvocation`, so nothing is exposed.
- **N-5, for U7 and T6:** after U7, the result-export and stress-neutral panels must refuse a successor by an explicit gate, not by a builder throwing. It is added to T6's notice at U7.

**I67's repair round** is in `WT/f2a-carriers-ts` on top of `9555b6ffc2`, covering SF-1, N-3, N-4 and the F1 pin. RV91 confirms it.

## RV83 confirms R-4 (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV83's confirmation** is `R/REVIEW_RV83/u4_g2_04/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `c099ce59…`; SHA256SUMS 13/13 OK). Verdict: **CONFIRMED**, with 0 BLOCKING, 0 SHOULD-FIX and 3 NOTE findings.
- **The dropped calls:** all 26 of RV83's tokens now produce edges. No `Self`-typed call is left without an edge, and the 29 remaining bracketed calls are std.
- **The reachable set** is exactly 2,698 + 7.
- **Limit 5 is accurate as a class.**
- **TEXT is unchanged** (2,044,161,940 B), and so are the admission summary and the recursion inventory (22 explicit and 40 implicit cycles). The only differing row is N-6's erratum.

**NOTEs:**
- **N-1:** `as_deref_mut()` unwraps (adaptive.rs:4087, :4288) are not handled, so one true call is dropped. It reaches no text, closes no cycle, and falls inside the stated rebinding class. Optional.
- **N-2:** a wording point about which typed binding is used. Optional.
- **N-3:** the deepest call chain from the Direct root is now **40 frames**, not 39; about 1.47 MiB by G3's arithmetic, so R and k are unchanged. **G6's record carries 40.**

**R-4 is closed,** and with it RV83's G2 review cycle.

## RV87 on S-2 in G5 part 2: NOT CONFIRMED; a class-wide identifier audit goes into G6 (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV87's confirmation** is `R/REVIEW_RV87/u4_g4_02/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `7f0203d2…`; SHA256SUMS OK; no machine paths). Verdict: **NOT CONFIRMED (S-2 only)**, with 0 BLOCKING, 1 SHOULD-FIX and 4 NOTE findings.
- **The 16 repaired sites are right,** and +71.9 MB is exactly their delta.
- **S-1, N-1(a)–(e) and N-2 are confirmed** in the generated profile. RV87's own G4 model reproduces the tree's T16 and T17 forms on every stride atom, and all 47 generated `FORMS` equal `profile_tree.json`.

**SF-1:** **18 more result-id copies are still priced in the 128-B identifier class:**
- 8 belong in the 1,024-B class (lib.rs:5592; source_receipt/rows.rs:308, :390, :533, :590, :592, :625; source_receipt.rs:1016);
- 10 are bounded by their own id templates (lib.rs:13044, :13074, :11617, :11649, and `result_id.clone()` at :4624, :5276, :5281, :5314, :5329, :5359).

That is +32.4 MB to the TAV. **In-build W3 dense rises to at most 0.8907 M,** still 37.5 MB under 0.9 M. **N-1:** diagnostic-id copies (ids up to 2,330 B) are priced at 128 B too; that is at most 40 KB.

**Ruled: repaired in G6, before registration, and as a class, not site by site.** This is the third round of underpriced identifier copies: G4 S-2's 6, part 2's 16, and now these 18. Repeated site-level repairs are not converging. I65 therefore audits the **whole class** in G6:
- every clone, format or `to_string` of an identifier-bearing field (result, diagnostic, case, member, support, node, load and source ids, and the like) on the D1 call graph;
- each priced at its source's bound (the 128-B input cap, a result id's 1,024-B class, a diagnostic id's 2,330 B, or its own template), never by name-pattern alone;
- every site stated with its bound, so RV87 can check the class as a whole.

Then I65 reruns TEXT, regenerates the profile and the pinned record, and re-confirms that the in-build maximum is ≤ 0.9 M. RV87 confirms the class audit at G6's review.
- **N-3** (string classes up to 745 B above exact sizes) and **N-4** (TAV_X counts two sites twice, so the estimate is conservative) are noted.

## RV88 on U6a, U6c, U6b (and U6d): all PASS; repair rounds and the shared declared-difference cases (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV88's reports** are in `R/REVIEW_RV88/`, with SHA256SUMS OK and no machine paths. Every unit passes, with 0 BLOCKING findings:

| Unit | Report | Verdict | Findings |
|---|---|---|---|
| U6a | `u6a_01` (`90212964…`) | PASS | 2 SHOULD-FIX, 5 NOTE |
| U6c | `u6c_01` (`7ed8af6f…`) | PASS | 0 SHOULD-FIX, 4 NOTE |
| U6b | `u6b_01` (`ba2d029a…`) | PASS | 1 SHOULD-FIX, 3 NOTE |
| U6d | `u6d_01` (`1206cab0…`) | PASS | 1 SHOULD-FIX, 4 NOTE |

**RV88's U6d review was finished before the reassignment arrived. It is kept,** so U6d now has two independent passes (RV88 and RV91).

**Rulings:**
- **U6b S-1, repaired now (I66):** compatibility.py:371–374 returns before the token guard at :404. A legacy 0.1.0 source with a W1 token row is therefore accepted by Python's dispatch, the v0.2 builder and the 0.1.0 wrapper, while Rust and TS refuse it. This is an **undeclared** cross-language difference, which D2 §4.7 forbids. Run the guard first.
- **U6a S-1, tests now (I66):** a token on a non-first row; a null member on a base derivative; a legacy 0.1.0 source carrying a receipt; and the two-case requested-ref order (mutants R01, R02, R05, R06).
- **U6a S-2, repaired now (I66):** derivative.rs:31's disclosure gives b "in the SI unit" without naming the unit. Read in a row's own unit (mm), it understates the bound 1000×. **The message must name the SI unit explicitly.** This is a truthfulness requirement on product text, and TS's labels (I67) must match.
- **U6c N-1 and N-4, tests and record (I66):** the Y-probes run over all 17 statements, as claimed, or the claim is corrected; and W06 (the successor stress-neutral branch's `source_annotations` requirement) is pinned.
- **U6b N-3, tests (I66):** kill Q02 (the token guard reads only the first row) and Q06 (requested refs compared as a set).
- **U6a N-3, a test (I66):** no product code calls the `#[doc(hidden)]` public seams.
- **The declared differences go into the shared parity file,** with per-language expectations. **This revises ROOT's RV91 ruling**, which pinned F1 in TS's test only; RV88 and RV91 both recommend the shared file. `retained_precision_carrier_cases.json` gains a `declared_differences` section. Each entry cites its ruling and gives one expectation per language:
  - I67's F1 (an unregistered invalid successor);
  - I67's F2 (the display-only binding precheck);
  - F-U6b-2 (Python refuses transport);
  - F5's refused-statement binding.
  
  Rust and Python consume it (I66), and TS consumes it (I67). Any other difference between the languages is a defect.
- **U6d S-1** (TS standing not bound to the current model or a valid capture) is the same as RV91's N-2: **a U7 precondition**, already ruled.
- **U6d N-3, repaired in I67's round:** the standing text says "historical values only" for a delivery refused in this session. Make it truthful for that case.
- **U6a N-2,** binding revalidates the whole statement per row (3.8 s for 98 rows in debug): a U6f cost item, alongside F7.
- **U6a N-5,** pre-existing: `validate_document` fails a canonical round trip because `0.0` ≠ `0`. Tracked to the result_export owner; it does not gate U6.

**Confirmation:** RV88 confirms I66's repairs, and RV91 confirms I67's. Then U6f.

## U6d repair round verified and committed (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I67's repair round** is `R/I67/u6d_typescript_02/` (SHA256SUMS 27/27 OK; no machine paths). ROOT committed it as `968adb44fe` on `codex/piping-f2a-carriers-ts-20261004`, on top of `9555b6ffc2`, and pushed it. It changes four files, all U6d's own.

**What it does:**
- **SF-1:** `buildAnalysisRunV02` refuses `retained_precision`, whether an object or null, and W1 token rows (`ANALYSIS_LEGACY_SOURCE_DOWNGRADE_FORBIDDEN`).
- **N-3:** RV08, RV09, RV03 and RV04 are killed.
- **N-4 and RV88's N-3:**
  - "Selected cases" appears only for a validated registration;
  - a delivery refused this session reads "unsupported, values shown for inspection only".
- **The F1 pin** is TS-local for now.

**ROOT's verification:**
- **The removed lines** are the old standing text and its test expectations, replaced by the new text and tests.
- **ROOT's runs:** Vitest **3,431/3,431**, and `tsc` clean.
- **I67's evidence:**
  - all 3,417 existing tests keep their outcome;
  - the sweep of 63 existing-identity and 17 successor envelopes is identical to `9555b6ffc2`;
  - 113 of 113 mutants killed.

**Still pending:**
- **I66's `declared_differences` section** in the shared parity file. TS switches its F1 pin to read from it in a small follow-up once it lands.
- **I66's SI-unit wording** (U6a S-2). TS's `N_RP_ABSOLUTE` already names the unit ("±b m", "±b Pa"); it is aligned when I66's text lands.

**RV91 confirms** SF-1, N-3 and N-4.

## RV91 confirms the U6d repair round (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV91's confirmation** is `R/REVIEW_RV91/u6d_02/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `f5272209…`; SHA256SUMS 15/15 OK). Verdict: **CONFIRMED** on `968adb44fe`, with 0 BLOCKING, 0 SHOULD-FIX and 1 NOTE.
- **SF-1** is refused on both legacy schema versions, for the object, null and `{}` member forms and for tokens on the first or last row. The three controls are unchanged.
- **N-3:** RV08, RV09, RV03 and RV04 are killed by committed tests alone.
- **N-4 and RV88's N-3** are fixed, in both the function and the rendered panel.
- **F1** is pinned TS-locally.
- **Nothing else changed:**
  - Vitest 3,431 and `tsc` clean;
  - RV91's 69-envelope sweep is identical;
  - the 17 successors differ only by the intended text change;
  - a merge preview with the carriers tip passes 3,443/3,443.

**N-1 (test only, optional):** add a 0.2.0 legacy shape, and a token on a later row, to the SF-1 tests. It goes into I67's small follow-up, together with:
- the switch to the shared `declared_differences` section;
- aligning to I66's SI-unit wording.

**U6d is accepted on review.** ROOT merges it into the carriers branch once I66's repair round is committed there, so that I66's uncommitted work is not disturbed.

## RV89 on U4 G5 part 2: PASS; the routing into G6 and the margin standard (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV89's report** is `R/REVIEW_RV89/u4_g5_02/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `4e5590f1…`; SHA256SUMS 33/33 OK; no machine paths). Verdict: **PASS** on `cba3e9fda7`, with 0 BLOCKING, 3 SHOULD-FIX and 6 NOTE findings.

**What RV89 established independently:**
- **Still no permit:** the registry is `&[]`, and the bound stays `Unpriced` at 1, 41, 42 and 1000 Estimates.
- **Nothing published changes:** the 4,022-line sweep is byte-identical.
- **Suites:** PP, runner/headless, FK `--lib` and SR are identical to base apart from additions.
- **The profile reproduces exactly:** all 47 forms and 244 atoms, RV89's own phase composition, its own build's 244 atom values (31 recomputed independently), and the in-build maximum of **0.884342 / 0.889237 M**.
- **The +73.3 MB rise over G4** decomposes to the byte into the routed corrections plus in-build strides.
- **The witnesses and challenge reproduce.** RV89's own permitted-path challenge peaks at no more than 0.4% of W3.
- **The part-1 findings are closed.**
- **I65's mutants reproduce** (146 of 148 killed); RV89 killed 10 of its own 12.

**Routed into G6 (I65):**
- **S-1:** five result-id copies are still priced by receiver spelling (source_receipt.rs:1016; rows.rs:533, :590, :592; lib.rs:5592), all on branch X; X1 is about 0.8241 M. **These are already inside G6's class-wide identifier audit,** which classifies by source type, never by name. RV87 confirms.
- **S-2: commit a deep-input witness.**
  - The milestone with a quote and backslash in every provenance plus a depth-16 raw value, publishing a successor at R/16 and at 1 MiB, in both modes. RV89 showed it passes, as evidence.
  - Assert W2's and W2b's outcomes; today they stop at fallbacks and assert nothing.
  
  This completes the S1 evidence STACK_INVENTORY assigns.
- **S-3:** a pure `maximum` test in which each phase in turn is the largest, killing Q10 (X1 and X2 skipped).

**The margin standard (RV89 N-1),** ruled. The dense margin is 43 MB, and about 73% of W3 is layout-free text and byte constants. Text revisions, not strides, are the risk; part 2's own S-2 moved W3 by +53 MB.
- **G6's record states a text-error budget:** the TAV_W fraction that would consume the margin, which is about 2.8% today.
- **G6's identifier audit must close the class.** After it, the maximum must still be ≤ 0.9 M at in-build strides.
- **If it exceeds 0.9 M,** I65 stops. ROOT then considers G3's phase-aware ordinary span (about −0.085 M), which is held in reserve and would need its own review, before any further cap change.
- **M itself keeps 446 MB of headroom.**

**Also ruled:**
- **N-4 and I65's decision 1:** the pinned in-build record is accepted, and G6 re-pins it per registered identity.
- **N-6 and RV85 U1:** binding the permit to its invocation is **not required before registration.** The permit is linear: neither `Clone` nor `Copy`, created by `admit` from the invocation's own parse, and consumed by that invocation's `permitted_dispatch`, so cross-invocation reuse is not constructible. It stays a wider-F2a hardening.
- **N-2, N-3 and N-5:** noted.

## I66's U6 repair round committed; U6d merged into the carriers branch; TS follows the shared format (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I66's repair round** is `R/I66/u6_repairs_01/` (SHA256SUMS 25/25 OK; no machine paths). ROOT committed it as `da274dd961` on `codex/piping-f2a-carriers-20261004`.

**ROOT's verification:**
- **The removed lines, read by ROOT:**
  - Python's guards are reordered so the token guard runs on every legacy path.
  - The removed Rust test assertions are re-expressed over wider forms: the real receipt, null, `{}` and a string, on base derivatives and raw sources.
  - The old disclosure-text assertion now runs over all nine units.
  - Nothing is dropped.
- **ROOT's runs:** result_export **167/167** (164 unchanged); the 24-file sweep plus the schema, carrier and contract tests, **1,843 passed, 30 skipped, 0 failed**.
- **The S-2 text** names the SI unit:
  - `… absolute bound b = {b} {SI} (binary64 {bits}), below the relative accuracy floor; …`;
  - `{SI}` maps m and mm to `m`, rad to `rad`, N and kN to `N`, N*m and kN*m to `N*m`, and Pa and MPa to `Pa`;
  - `{b}` is Rust's `{:e}`.
  
  **`N*m` (the repository's own spelling) is accepted.**
- **The shared carrier case file is now format v2:** 20 cases, plus a `declared_differences` section of exactly four ruled entries (I67-F1, I67-F2, F-U6b-2 and F5), with per-language expectations. Rust and Python consume it.
- **Beyond D-U6-9:** the 0.1.0 wrapper also refuses token rows. Accepted; it is the same guard.

**The merge.** ROOT merged `codex/piping-f2a-carriers-ts-20261004` (`968adb44fe`, U6d with its repair round) into the carriers branch as `52052ece61`, and pushed it. **The carriers branch now holds all of U6:** U6a, U6b, U6c, U6d and U6e, with their repairs.

**ROOT's Vitest run on the merged head:** 3,442 passed and **7 failed**. All 7 are U6d's shared-parity tests, which read the v1 case format. They are the format pin, plus the six new parity cases on raw legacy 0.1.0 and preview-physics-1 fixtures. **This is expected,** pending I67's follow-up; nothing else fails.

**I67's follow-up, in `WT/f2a-carriers` (I66 is idle there):**
- the TS consumer adopts case format v2, including the six new cases;
- TS reads its F1 and F2 expectations from `declared_differences`, replacing the TS-local pin;
- TS disclosure text matches the S-2 wording and `{:e}` number format wherever TS emits that message;
- RV91's N-1 tests: a 0.2.0 legacy shape, and a token on a later row.

**Then:** RV88 confirms I66's repairs, RV91 confirms I67's follow-up, and U6f follows.

## U4 G6 returned; registration rulings; blocked ordinary runs decline W1 at G-C (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I65's G6** is `R/I65/u4_g6_01/` (SHA256SUMS 70/70 OK; no machine paths). It is uncommitted in `WT/f2a-memory` on top of `cba3e9fda7`.

**What it establishes:**
- **The 42 Estimates are closed** (ESTIMATES = 0), adding +9.77 MB.
- **The class-wide identifier audit** (`ID_CLASS_AUDIT.md`) covers 747 copy entries over 599 sites, each priced by its source. 72 were raised and none lowered. TEXT now enforces the table, and TEXT is 2,149,902,046 B, complete.
- **The in-build maximum** (dev/test build; the release record is byte-identical) is **0.8878 M sparse and 0.8927 M dense,** 49.0 MB and 29.3 MB under 0.9 M. The text-error budget is 1.86% dense.
- **The S1 evidence:** 9 witnesses at R/16 in both builds, plus the deep-input witness (RV89 S-2), and S-3's phase test.
- **QUALIFICATION.md** proposes M = 4,026,531,840 B.
- **registration.diff** is prepared and not applied.

**Rulings:**
1. **Register the dev/test identity only:** aarch64-apple-darwin, rustc 1.97.1 `8bab26f4f68e`, debug, opt-level 0, debug assertions on, panic=unwind, no RUSTFLAGS. It is the build in which U3 grant 2's milestone run, U7's publications and U9's gates on this host run. The release identity is qualified but unregistered, until a release run is named. Hosted Linux CI stays Stale, so it uses the ordinary route.
2. **(a) A blocked ordinary run declines W1 at G-C, with exact ordinary bytes.** Under registration, D1 admits Direct requests whose ordinary run is blocked before any solve (an invalid category or document kind, `rejected_stress_range`). Those would otherwise publish the ordinary envelope plus a `RETAINED_PRECISION_UNAVAILABLE` notice. C1:64 ("decline W1 before execution and preserve the ordinary transaction") and ROUTING:98 (a notice only for W1 work that actually ran) rule that out.
   - G-C gains a fact that refuses **when the ordinary route returned without attempting the case's solve**.
   - It is a `CompleteGate` fallback with **no notice**, so the bytes are identical to the value route.
   - **Cases whose solve ran, at any quality (sensitive, unresolved, failed), proceed as before.** They are D6b's routed cases, and the milestone is Sensitive.
   - I65 derives the exact predicate from source, or stops if it is ambiguous. It is inside U4's fence.
   
   **(b)** B-1's single-dispatch count test goes to U3 grant 2 (I61).
3. **The two test hunks outside U4's fence** in registration.diff are applied with the entry, as part of the same reviewed change.

**The sequence:** I65's 2(a) addendum, then ROOT commits G6 unregistered. **RV89** then reviews G6 and registration.diff, and **RV87** confirms the identifier audit. **ROOT applies the registration only after both pass,** and selects M = 4,026,531,840 B under D-7. That makes permits constructible in the registered dev/test build on this host. Reader eligibility and public activation stay closed until U7.

## U6d follow-up (round 03) verified and committed; all of U6 is green on the carriers branch (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I67's round 03** is `R/I67/u6d_typescript_03/` (SHA256SUMS 29/29 OK; no machine paths). ROOT committed it as `76477534f6` on `codex/piping-f2a-carriers-20261004` and pushed it.

**What it does:**
- **TS consumes case format v2:** 20 cases, raw and milestone fixtures, each sha-checked.
- **F1 and F2 come from the shared `declared_differences`,** replacing the TS-local pin. I67 confirms that all four of I66's `typescript` expectations are correct, by test.
- **The absolute label's unit** uses Rust's nine-entry SI table, and an unknown unit claims no bound. TS emits only the display label, never the derivative message, because every successor output is refused in TS; the label's b rounded upward to 3 significant digits is by design.
- **RV91's N-1:** SF-1 tests on the 0.1.0 and 0.2.0 legacy shapes and on a later-row token.

**ROOT's verification:**
- The only product-code removal is the old four-entry unit map, replaced by the stricter nine-entry table.
- **ROOT's runs on the carriers branch:** Vitest **3,466/3,466**, and `tsc` clean. The 7 failures expected after the v2 move now pass.
- **I67's evidence:**
  - 3,437 outcomes unchanged;
  - 21 new tests;
  - the sweep of 63 existing-identity and 17 successor envelopes is identical;
  - 118 of 118 mutants killed.

**The carriers branch now holds all of U6 with every repair,** and is green: Rust result_export 167, the Python sweep 1,843, and desktop Vitest 3,466.

**Next:**
- RV91 confirms round 03, and RV88 confirms I66's repair round (in flight).
- **Then U6f:** a fresh complete-diff review of U6 against NUM, with the three-language parity table and the R-1 carrier-interface items C-1 to C-3.

## RV88 confirms I66's U6 repairs (one gap); U6f dispatched; the post-U6f repair round (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV88's confirmation** is `R/REVIEW_RV88/u6_repairs_01/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `96355b91…`; SHA256SUMS 22/22 OK). Verdict: **NOT CONFIRMED on one item (U6a N-3); every other item is CONFIRMED;** nothing blocking.

**Fixed:**
- **U6b S-1:** first, middle and last-row tokens are refused on every Python path.
- **U6a S-2:** all 138 milestone disclosures match byte for byte, and 15 units × 9 bounds match; a unit swap is refused 8/8.
- **U6a S-1:** R01, R02, R05 and R06 are killed.
- **U6b N-3:** Q02 and Q06 are killed.
- **U6c N-1 and N-4** are fixed.
- **`declared_differences`:** the structure and all 8 Rust and Python values reproduce.

**Routed to the post-U6f repair round:**
- **U6a N-3 (NOTE), the guard scope.** The doc(hidden)-seam guard test scans each Rust file only up to its first `#[cfg(test)]`, which leaves 38% of the lines unscanned (src-tauri, runner, and most of PP lib.rs). RV88's mutant G1 survives. No product caller exists today.
  - **Remedy (I66):** drop only the `#[cfg(test)]`-gated item, matching braces; count the bare seam name; re-run a G1-style mutant.
- **N-1 (new), an undeclared TS difference.** F-U6b-2's entry says TS runs transport checks, but TS's carrier transport route checks shape only; no TS carrier calls `validateRetainedPrecisionTransport`. A tampered transported statement is refused by Rust and Python but passes TS's header route.
  - That is a difference **outside** the four declared entries.
  - **Remedy (I67):** TS's carrier transport route calls the reader's `validateRetainedPrecisionTransport`, as Rust's does, and the entry's text is corrected. Only if TS cannot do that is it declared, by a further ruling.

**U6f is dispatched now** on the carriers head, as RV92 under `BRIEFS/RV92_U6F_COMPLETE_REVIEW.md`. Its parity table must show N-1. The post-U6f repair round takes N-3, N-1 and whatever U6f finds, and RV92 confirms. **RV91's round-03 confirmation is in flight;** any finding joins the same round.

## RV91 confirms U6d round 03 (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV91's confirmation** is `R/REVIEW_RV91/u6d_03/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `083d5e55…`; SHA256SUMS 16/16 OK). Verdict: **CONFIRMED**, with 0 BLOCKING, 0 SHOULD-FIX and 0 NOTE findings.
- **N-1:** the 0.1.0 and 0.2.0 legacy shapes are covered, and so are later-row tokens. RVb1 and RVb2 are killed, and so is the new RVc1.
- **Case format v2 and `declared_differences`:** RV91's own consumer agrees on all 20 cases and all 8 entry-and-fixture pairs. Each TS expectation equals RV91's independent observations, and the retired local pin's coverage survives in the shared `edited_row` cases.
- **The nine-entry unit table** equals Rust's `si_unit`. 11 unknown units, including `toString`, `constructor` and `__proto__`, claim no bound.
- **No regressions:** Vitest 3,466 and `tsc` clean; an 86-envelope sweep identical.

**U6d's review cycle is closed.** All U6 units are now reviewed and confirmed, apart from RV88's U6a N-3 and N-1, which are routed to the post-U6f round. RV92 (U6f) is running.

## U4 G6 committed unregistered; RV89 and RV87 dispatched (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I65's G6, with the 2(a) addendum,** is `R/I65/u4_g6_01/` (SHA256SUMS 75/75 OK; no machine paths). ROOT committed it, **unregistered**, as `2bb81ec1ea` on `codex/piping-f2a-memory-20261004`, on top of `cba3e9fda7`, and pushed it. The worktree's diff equals I65's recorded `candidate_g6.diff` byte for byte.

**ROOT's verification:**
- `REGISTERED_PROFILES` is still `&[]`.
- **The 2(a) predicate** is `ordinary_solve_attempted`: at least one seed, and every seed's `initial` is set. The seed is set exactly at the solve attempt or at the report.
- **ROOT's runs:** PP `--lib` gave 533 passed, 1 failed (t13), 10 ignored; **all 9 witnesses pass**; the challenge passes.

**2(a), as implemented:** `PhaseFact::OrdinarySolveNotAttempted` (cap 0). It deliberately ignores envelope status, which is ambiguous because `blocked_envelope` is returned both before and after an attempted solve.
- **Declined** (exact bytes, no notice): an invalid document kind, an invalid load category, no supports, and a lone spring.
- **Proceeding:** the milestone; a 1e-300 spring, whose attempt fails; W6; and **`rejected_stress_range`.** Its solve ran (Sensitive) and only afterwards did the legacy finalization block it, so under the ruled rule it reaches W1 and, on fallback, carries the N1 notice. It is the only blocked example whose bytes change under registration. **This is accepted:** W1 work actually ran (ROUTING:98).

**The registered scratch run** (`registration.diff`, 4 files):
- PP 698 passed, 1 failed (t13);
- the milestone publishes in both modes;
- every retained report is Registered;
- the unattempted-solve examples are byte-identical to the value route.

**The reviews:**
- **RV89** reviews G6 together with `registration.diff`;
- **RV87** confirms the identifier-class audit (`ID_CLASS_AUDIT.md`), including its own 18 sites and RV89's 5.

**ROOT applies the registration only after both pass,** and selects M = 4,026,531,840 B under D-7.

## RV87 on the identifier-class audit: NOT CONFIRMED; the class closes before registration (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV87's report** is `R/REVIEW_RV87/u4_g6_01/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `f2b0bf72…`; SHA256SUMS 9/9 OK; no machine paths). Verdict: **NOT CONFIRMED**, with 0 BLOCKING, 3 SHOULD-FIX and 3 NOTE findings.

**Confirmed:**
- RV87's 18 sites and RV89's 5 are at the right bounds.
- G6's TEXT run and every phase of the maximum reproduce exactly.
- The deltas reconcile (+32,373,120 B from the 18 sites, +922,634 B from 50 other rows, none lowered).

**Not confirmed: the class is closed.**
- **SF-1:** the node-DOF label, `integrity_dof_label(model, dof)`, produces up to 131 B but is priced as a 20-B integer, because `_dof` matches the integer rule first. That affects five format sites (lib.rs:1632, :1644, :1708, :1721, :1739) and the `:1763` template bound.
- **SF-2:** the adapter's `copy(s)` (retained_product.rs:3125) is priced by its variable name (the f64 rule), because G4's site rule is keyed to a stale line (2963). Three `site_zero` keys match no row at all.
- **SF-3:** the enforcement fires only when an identifier rule matches. Copies priced by non-identifier rules or by site overrides go unchecked, and by RV87's static count 15 of 735 entries could be removed silently.

**The cost is small.** With SF-1 and SF-2 priced, W3 dense is 0.8929 M, 28.6 MB under 0.9 M.

**Ruled: SF-1 to SF-3 are repaired before registration.**
- **Why.** Margin is not the reason. ROOT's standing rule is that "a site … not cover[ed] is a missing term, never zero", and the handoff forbids enabling a permit on partially priced terms. A known unpriced identifier copy is such a term. A coverage claim that cannot be checked is not established (workflow §3).
- **The repair (I65):**
  - price the label placeholders and `:1763` at the label's bound;
  - re-key or audit `copy()` at its actual line and price it by source; G4's intended class for all 199 copies is acceptable as a conservative bound;
  - make TEXT **fail** when a site-keyed rule matches no row, and when any identifier-bearing candidate is missing from the table, **whichever rule would price it**;
  - remove or re-key the stale `site_zero` keys;
  - regenerate the profile and the identity-gated pinned record, and update `registration.diff`;
  - re-confirm the maximum is ≤ 0.9 M.
- **N-1 and N-2** are wording: the audit's scope states which name-filtered copies other families price; the `suffix` rows are labelled as input ids.
- **The review:** RV87 confirms the repair. RV89 reviews the code delta (the constants and the pinned record) as part of its G6 review, together with `registration.diff`. **Registration waits for both.**

## RV92 (U6f) on the whole of U6: PASS; the post-U6f repair round; U7 preconditions (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV92's report** is `R/REVIEW_RV92/u6f_01/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `ac462bf9…`; SHA256SUMS 64/64 OK; no machine paths). Verdict: **PASS** on `76477534f6` (merge base `7e4f5a51dd`), with 0 BLOCKING, 1 SHOULD-FIX and 7 new NOTE findings.

**What RV92 established for the assembled whole:**
- **Existing behaviour unchanged:** a sweep of 546 inputs through all three languages, base against candidate.
- **Suites:**
  - result_export 149 → 167;
  - the Python sweep 1,843, with only the 3 ruled pins changed;
  - Vitest 3,258 → 3,466, with 0 base outcomes changed;
  - `tsc` clean;
  - runner/headless identical;
  - PP's U1 and U3 pins 41/41 in a merge preview.
- **The receipt survives end to end** in 18/18 cases, byte-equal, revalidated and `needs_recompute`.
- **Parity:** 192 probes. All 20 shared cases and all 4 declared entries reproduce, and Rust and Python agree in 192 of 192.
- **The flags are false, and nothing is weakened.**

**Rulings:**
- **S-1 → I66:** Python's AnalysisRun receipt-copy check (compatibility.py:694) compares with `!=`, so `False == 0` and `True == 1`, and it accepts what TS refuses. Compare canonical bytes, as TS does, and add tests. The same pattern at :684 and :689 (source-block receipt, contract evidence) **predates U6**, so it is flagged as a separate task, to keep U6's "existing identities unchanged" claim exact.
- **N-1 → I67** (RV88's, now confirmed with 10 probes): TS's carrier transport route must call `validateRetainedPrecisionTransport`.
- **N-2: declared,** as a fifth `declared_differences` entry. TS's header route reads raw rows, so it refuses a non-successor source with a W1 token row that Rust and Python admit header-only. It is stricter and fails closed.
- **N-3: I67-F2 widened** to "no valid registration (none, or refused)", with a `summary` subject (TS's summary is empty while Rust and Python give counts). It fails closed.
- **N-4 and N-5:** the case file gains a scope sentence. **Differences inherited from the base carriers** (G7 dispatch text, Rust's header ignoring `carrier_evidence`, the AnalysisRun builders' refusal codes) **are not U6 differences, and G7 parity compares the reader's gate and code.** N-5 (TS no longer refuses a source-blocks envelope's summary row when it carries a receipt or token, because the envelope is refused first) is declared with the downgrade entry.
- **N-6 → U3 grant 2:**
  - document that `into_parts()` drops a successor (C-1);
  - document `successor()` as a borrowing second path beside `into_publication()` (C-3);
  - C-2 holds.
- **N-7:** binding cost is quadratic (0.38 s release for 98 rows). **Memoize before native activation**; it is not a U7 precondition.
- **N-8, U7 preconditions:** the list gains:
  - S-1 fixed;
  - N-1 repaired, and N-2 to N-5 declared;
  - a rerun of all three languages' carrier tests and the survival chain on **live** output;
  - N-6 resolved;
  - standing compared by token, not TS's status string.

  These join RV91's N-2 and N-5 and RV88's U6d S-1.

**The post-U6f repair round**, in `WT/f2a-carriers` on top of `76477534f6`, sequenced so the two authors don't share the worktree concurrently:
- **I66 first:** S-1; the case-file additions (N-2, the widened F2, the N-4/N-5 scope sentence); and RV88's U6a N-3 guard scope.
- **I67 next:** N-1 (TS transport validation); TS consumption of the new declared entries.

**RV92 confirms. Then U6 merges into NUM.**

## RV89 on U4 G6 with registration.diff: PASS; three items join the pre-registration delta (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV89's report** is `R/REVIEW_RV89/u4_g6_01/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `25f1105a…`; SHA256SUMS 23/23 OK; no machine paths). Verdict: **PASS** on `2bb81ec1ea`, with `registration.diff` (sha256 `35c72703…`) applied in RV89's own copy only. 0 BLOCKING, 3 SHOULD-FIX and 6 NOTE findings. RV89 sees **no reason not to register once S-1 is fixed.**

**What RV89 established:**
- **The registered entry matches this build exactly:** identity, reviewed inputs and layouts. Three other builds (`RUSTFLAGS`, opt-level 1, release) each report `Stale` and keep the ordinary bytes.
- **`admit` grants a permit for the milestone in both modes,** and refuses Headless, the two-case variant and 21 further D1 violations, each at its own clause.
- **The milestone publishes U1's pinned successor bytes** through the facade.
- **Registered suites:** PP 698/1/11 (t13). The sweep differs only by `Registered` and the successors for 6 in-D1 inputs.
- **The G-C solve fact** agrees with an independent counter on all 182 runs. 38 unattempted in-D1 runs decline with exact bytes, and `rejected_stress_range` keeping its notice fits ROUTING:98.
- **The maximum reproduces** (0.887840 / 0.892735 M), and all 9 witnesses plus the deep-input witness pass in debug and release.

**Routed into I65's pre-registration delta,** together with RV87's SF-1 to SF-3:
- **S-1 (the registration package):** runner/headless `tests/retained_precision_admission.rs:82` asserts the Headless report's profile is `Missing`. Under registration it reads `Registered`, because the runner builds PP with the registered identity. **The flip joins `registration.diff`** (ruling 3), and runner/headless is re-run registered.
- **S-2 (a test):** add one of K2a's four deferred-formation range shapes to `attempted_examples()`. It kills R8.
- **S-3 (a test):** pin that `admit` adds R (64 MiB) before comparing with M. Expose the bound as a named pure function, or record `required` in the private law record, and test it at the edges. It kills R6.

**Noted:**
- **N-1, the lock residual is now live.** PP's lock record hashes PP's own lock, so workspaces with another serde_json (runner and self_weight_wasm 1.0.151, operation_applier 1.0.150) also report `Registered`. None calls the Direct entry, and Headless is refused at D1.0, so **no permit is reachable there.** This is the accepted D-6 residual. **Any future Direct caller from another workspace requires re-qualification**, and that is recorded as a U9 and wider-F2a condition.
- **N-2, the bytes registration changes:**
  - successors for the milestone and 5 in-D1 variants;
  - the N1 notice wherever a solve was attempted and W1 fell back: a 1e-300 spring, W6, both `rejected_stress_range` fixtures, and K2a's four range shapes.
  
  Everything else keeps exact bytes.
- **N-3 to N-6:** noted.

**RV89 reviews I65's delta as a follow-on** (it kept its copies and caches), and RV87 confirms its SF items. **Registration follows both.**

## U4 G6 pre-registration repair committed; I66's post-U6f part committed; confirmations dispatched (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I65's repair** is `R/I65/u4_g6_01/`, Addendum 2 (SHA256SUMS 118/118 OK; no machine paths; `_run_records/` keeps G6's sealed bytes). ROOT committed it as `b43378d90a` on `codex/piping-f2a-memory-20261004`, on top of `2bb81ec1ea`, and pushed it. The worktree's diff equals `candidate_g6r.diff`, and `REGISTERED_PROFILES` is still `&[]`.

**What it does:**
- **SF-1:** the node-DOF label is priced at 131 B at the five sites, plus a sixth (lib.rs:1149) that the new enforcement found. `:1763` goes from 8,241 to 8,352.
- **SF-2:** `copy(s)` is priced by source at its actual line (327 → 1,024 B), and the stale `site_zero` keys are removed.
- **SF-3:** TEXT fails on `id-unaudited`, `stale-key` and `stale-audit-entry`. 8 controls each fail with their own finding, including RV87's `primitive_loads lib.rs:299` removal. **Stated residual:** the candidate predicate is syntactic, so an id aliased under a token-less local name, or a key drifting onto another row on the same line, is not detected.
- **N-1 and N-2** (wording) are done.
- **RV89 S-1:** registration.diff now includes the runner/headless flip; registered, runner/headless is identical to base.
- **RV89 S-2:** the deferred-formation shape kills R8.
- **RV89 S-3:** `admission_bound` is a named pure function, tested at M−R−1, M−R, M−R+1 and M; `required` is in the law record; R6 is killed.

**The in-build maximum:** **0.8881 M sparse, 0.8929 M dense,** 28.4 MB under 0.9 M dense. The text-error budget is 1.81% dense.

**ROOT's runs:** PP `--lib` gave 534 passed, 1 failed (t13), 10 ignored; the challenge passes.

**The updated `registration.diff`** has sha256 `976b722d…` (5 files, 323 lines). G6's reviewed version is kept as `registration.g6.diff` (`35c72703…`).

**Confirmations:**
- **RV89** reviews this delta and the updated `registration.diff` as its G6 follow-on;
- **RV87** confirms SF-1 to SF-3 and N-1/N-2.

**Registration follows both.**

**U6 post-U6f:** I66's part is committed as `6383e8e70e` (canonical receipt compare, case format v3 with five declared differences, the whole-file seam guard). ROOT's runs: result_export 168/168; Python carrier and schema tests 78/78; **the full 24-file sweep plus the schema, carrier and contract tests, 1,843 passed, 30 skipped, 0 failed.** I67's TS part (N-1 transport, v3) is in progress.

## The post-U6f round complete; RV92 confirms (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I67's part** is `R/I67/u6d_typescript_04/` (SHA256SUMS 26/26 OK; no machine paths). ROOT committed it as `b10ee5cf08` on `codex/piping-f2a-carriers-20261004`, on top of I66's `6383e8e70e`, and pushed it.

**What it does:**
- **N-1:** TS's `sourceContractTransport`, the twin of Rust's `for_source_metadata`, runs the header dispatch and then the reader's `validateRetainedPrecisionTransport`. RV92's 10 tampered probes are refused with Rust's codes, and an untampered transport passes, full and header-only.
- **TS consumes case format v3** (20 cases, 5 declared entries with 20 forms) and confirms every `typescript` expectation I66 wrote.

**ROOT's verification:**
- The only product-code removal is a replaced import.
- **ROOT's runs:** Vitest **3,494/3,494**, `tsc` clean.
- **I67's evidence:** every other file's outcomes are identical; 123 of 123 mutants killed.

**The post-U6f round is complete:** I66's `6383e8e70e` (the Python sweep 1,843 passed, 0 failed) and I67's `b10ee5cf08`. **RV92 confirms both,** covering S-1, N-1 and the declared N-2 to N-5, the v3 case file, and RV88's U6a N-3 guard. **U6 then merges into NUM.** A new U6d item for T6's notice: no product caller of a transported successor exists, and every TS consumer is a T6 surface that refuses first.

## RV87 confirms the identifier class closed; the syntactic residual accepted as a re-qualification obligation (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV87's confirmation** is `R/REVIEW_RV87/u4_g6_02/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `dabfdf5f…`; SHA256SUMS 9/9 OK). Verdict: **CONFIRMED** on `b43378d90a`, with 0 BLOCKING, 0 SHOULD-FIX and 3 NOTE findings.

**Confirmed:**
- **SF-1:** the five label sites are at 131 B, and the sixth site (lib.rs:1149, `global_dof`) is real.
- **SF-2:** `copy()` is priced at its actual line, and the stale keys are gone.
- **SF-3:** the enforcement is authoritative. RV87's four controls fail exactly, including the non-identifier fallback that was silent at G6, a moved entry and a stale key.
- **N-1 is confirmed;** N-2 is confirmed apart from two labels.
- **TEXT and every phase of the maximum reproduce;** W3 dense is 0.8929 M, 28.4 MB under 0.9 M.

**The residual, ruled.** The candidate predicate is syntactic: an id aliased under a token-less local name is not a candidate. RV87 showed this is real, with an aliased `end` at :1721 that silently drops 85 KB. RV87 then established that **nothing currently hides behind it**:
- all 410 positive-multiplicity non-candidate expressions were read by type, and none is an aliased identifier;
- none of the 1,494 non-test lines added since `1e323058f3` produces text.

**Accepted for this registration, as a bound re-qualification obligation.** It is recorded in QUALIFICATION.md and in the D-6 record. **Any code change on the D1 call graph re-runs TEXT and repeats RV87's non-candidate review,** unless the gap is first closed by RV87's suggested inversion (requiring an explicit table row for any bare-local expression priced by a non-identifier class). That obligation joins U9's gates and every re-registration.

**Optional, non-gating, routed to I65:**
- N-2: relabel the two leftover `suffix` rows (retained_product.rs:2332, :2351) as IN128;
- N-3: strip the code comment from the `lib.rs:1149` audit key.

**Registration now waits only for RV89's follow-on.**

## RV89 passes the pre-registration delta; one runner-test change before registration (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV89's follow-on** is `R/REVIEW_RV89/u4_g6_02/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `b7a6223e…`; SHA256SUMS 22/22 OK). Verdict: **PASS** on `b43378d90a`, with the updated `registration.diff` (`976b722d…`) applied in RV89's own copy. 0 BLOCKING, 0 SHOULD-FIX and 3 NOTE findings; **no reason not to register.**

**Confirmed:**
- **S-1:** runner/headless is identical to base when registered.
- **S-2:** R8 is killed.
- **S-3:** `admission_bound` adds the constant R, then compares with M; the edges hold; `required` = E + R; R6 is killed.
- **The maximum reproduces:** 0.888054 / 0.892949 M.
- **Stale is still enforced** for the RUSTFLAGS and release builds, and the pinned successor is unchanged.

**N-1, ruled: fixed before registration.** S-1's new runner test calls the Direct entry on `rf_skew_t_cant_off_122`, an input inside D1. Under registration, the runner workspace (serde_json 1.0.151, against PP's reviewed 1.0.149) would therefore admit it and run W1. That makes **a live Direct caller outside PP's lock,** which ROOT's G6 ruling forbids without re-qualification ("any future Direct caller from another workspace requires re-qualification"). The successor bytes RV89 saw were identical, but that does not discharge the rule.
- **The fix (I65):** the runner test reads the profile status from an input that D1 refuses after the build clause, such as the two-case variant (refused at D1.4). The report then still carries Registered or Stale, and **W1 never runs outside PP's lock.**
- `registration.diff` is regenerated, and the registered runner/headless run is re-run.

**N-2** (R9 is equivalent) and **N-3** (Addendum 2's "uncommitted" wording) are noted.

**Then ROOT applies the registration.**

## RV92 on the post-U6f round: one transport residue, declared by a scope sentence (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV92's confirmation** is `R/REVIEW_RV92/u6f_02/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `21ea4817…`; SHA256SUMS 45/45 OK). On `b10ee5cf08`, items 1, 2, 4 and 5 are **CONFIRMED**, and item 3 is not confirmed on one part. 0 BLOCKING, 0 SHOULD-FIX and 1 new NOTE (N-9).
- **S-1:** the 12 probes agree between Python and TS, and 18/18 receipts survive.
- **N-1:** the 10 tampered transports are refused with Rust's codes, and 6 untampered ones pass.
- **The five declared entries and the N-4 sentence** reproduce in all three languages.
- **RV88's seam guard:** 8 of 8 mutants killed, including G1.
- **No other change:** the 546-input sweep is identical; result_export 168; the Python sweep 1,843; Vitest 3,494.

**N-9: two Rust/TS transport differences outside the five entries and the scope sentence.**
- **(a):** a successor's `contract_evidence` gaining an extra key, with hashes consistent, is accepted by Rust's header dispatch (which checks only that it is an object). It is refused by TS's new transport route at the reader's G7, as Python's check would refuse it. The same gap exists at base for preview-physics-1.
- **(b):** 28 successor-id sources whose header TS refuses are refused by both, with different codes.

**Neither direction admits what another refuses.**

**Ruled: declared by the scope sentence, as RV92 prefers; no code change.**
- **I66 adds a sentence** to the case file's `scope`, in substance: "Rust's header dispatch checks only that preview `contract_evidence` is an object, so TS's transport route, like Python's check, refuses evidence content that Rust accepts; a transport refused before the reader runs carries each language's own code, so parity there compares only accept against refuse."
- **I66 updates the scope assertions** in the Rust, Python and TS consumers, one line each. This is a fence extension to the TS test line, so the change stays atomic.
- RV92's optional alignment of 24 of the 28 codes in TS is **not** required.
- **RV92 confirms. Then U6 merges into NUM.**

## Registration applied; M = 4,026,531,840 B selected under D-7; U3 grant 2 dispatched (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I65's runner-test change (RV89 G6r N-1)** is in `R/I65/u4_g6_01` RETURN.md Addendum 3 (SHA256SUMS 122/122 OK; no machine paths).
- **`registration.diff`:** sha256 `9ae2c889daeb8ec59c159c49b2f5eddf99472eaff7cd8d63bbd8263f909ce40b`; 5 files, +183/−23.
- **ROOT compared it with `registration.g6r.diff`.** Only the runner/headless hunk differs. `explicit_headless_refusal_…` now reads the profile from the Direct entry on the two-case variant, which D1.4 refuses after the build clause. It asserts:
  - that the Direct bytes equal the value route's;
  - that there is no successor;
  - that the census sees two load cases.
- **I65's scratch-only permit probe** granted 2 permits with the previous test (the positive control) and 0 with the new one across the whole runner suite. **N-1 is discharged:** no runner test reaches W1 outside PP's reviewed lock.
- **Records-only items:**
  - RV87 G6r N-2: three identifier rows are relabelled; bounds and bytes are unchanged.
  - RV87 G6r N-3: `//` comments are stripped from audit keys.
  - RV87 G6r N-1: the re-qualification obligation is recorded in QUALIFICATION.md §11.
  - RV89 G6r N-3.
  - I65 re-ran the TEXT chain; its outputs are byte-identical.

**Applied:** ROOT applied `registration.diff` to `b43378d90a` in WT/f2a-memory and committed it as **`0c7827b6ad`** on `codex/piping-f2a-memory-20261004` (pushed).
- **The commit equals the reviewed diff:** applying the diff to `b43378d90a` in a scratch index writes tree `e78dff392b99…`, the commit's own tree.

**ROOT's registered runs in WT/f2a-memory** (`--locked --offline`, CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4, RUST_TEST_THREADS=2, memguard 5387 running):
- **This build is the registered one.** The build script's `OPS_RETAINED_BUILD_IDENTITY` and `OPS_RETAINED_REVIEWED_INPUTS` equal the registered entry's strings byte for byte. PP's `retained_precision_admission`, which expects `Registered` exactly when the identity matches, passes 5/5.
- **PP (all targets, `--no-fail-fast`):** 699 passed, 1 failed (the Mac t13), 10 ignored. Witnesses: 9/9.
- **runner/headless:** 85 passed, 2 failed (base's own two `load_reference` failures).
- **Outcome-identical to I65's registered run.** I65's eleventh ignored test is its scratch-only `zz_i65_g5_fixture_sweep`, which is not in the tree.

**Selected: M = 4,026,531,840 B (3.75 GiB) under D-7,** for the one registered build. That build is the dev/test identity: aarch64-apple-darwin, rustc 1.97.1 `8bab26f4f68e`, debug, opt-level 0, debug assertions on, panic=unwind, no RUSTFLAGS.
- **The admission law priced in that build:** E_mov,max + R ≤ 0.8881 M sparse and 0.8929 M dense (R = 64 MiB, S1), within the 0.9 M margin rule.
- Pricing is complete (ESTIMATES = 0), so **no permit rests on symbolic or partially priced terms.**

**What this establishes, and what it does not.**
- A permit is now constructible only for in-domain (D1) Direct invocations in this one build identity, within PP's reviewed lock. Every other identity is `Stale` and keeps the ordinary route.
- It does **not** open reader eligibility, standing (receipts stay `needs_recompute` until U7) or public activation.
- **Re-qualification obligations stand:**
  - any future Direct caller from another workspace;
  - any change to the D1 call graph (re-run TEXT and repeat RV87's non-candidate review);
  - QUALIFICATION.md §11.

**Next: I61, U3 grant 2** (`BRIEFS/I61_U3_GRANT2.md`), in WT/f2a-memory on top of `0c7827b6ad`, uncommitted, with records in `R/I61/u3_grant2_01/`. It covers:
- the permit-path tests on the actual Direct entry;
- B′ and B-1;
- SV18;
- D-U6-5;
- U5 rerun on the live successor bytes in both modes.

An independent review (RV93) of grant 2 follows. Then the memory branch (U3 1d, G5, G6, the registration and grant 2) merges into NUM.

## RV92 confirms N-9; U6 merged into NUM; the U6 reader delta routes U4 to G7 before the memory branch merges (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV92's addendum** is `R/REVIEW_RV92/u6f_02/ADDENDUM_01.md` (sha256 `ffc3c816…`; SHA256SUMS 53/53 OK). Verdict: **PASS**. I66's scope sentence truthfully and fully declares N-9 (a) and (b), and the three pins hold it. Re-checked:
- Rust: 14/14 identical;
- Python: 78 passed, identical;
- Vitest: 224/224 identical.

**O-1** (pin the TS code in the scope text) and **O-2** (Rust reaches its base header code after the reader's G0–G2) are optional and noted, not taken.

I66's change is committed on the carriers branch as `5f8d6291b8` (4 files, one line each). ROOT checked each file's sha256 against I66's return. Records are in `R/I66/u6_postf_02`.

**U6 is merged into NUM at `f172f86abe`.** The merge was clean: 40 files. On NUM's side, only four `PP/src` files differ from the carriers tip, so Python, TypeScript, schemas, fixtures and `result_export` are byte-identical to the reviewed tip. ROOT's acceptance runs on the merged tree:

| Suite | Result |
|---|---|
| PP, all targets | 660 passed, 1 failed (t13), 1 ignored |
| runner/headless | 85 passed, 2 failed (base's `load_reference`) |
| result_export | 168 passed |
| The 24-file Python sweep plus the three retained suites | 1,843 passed, 30 skipped, 0 failed (RV92's count) |

Vitest is not re-run, since its inputs are byte-identical to the reviewed tip. Receipts keep `needs_recompute` standing, and reader eligibility stays closed until U7.

**The integration finding (ROOT): the registered profile was priced on the pre-U6 reader.**
- The memory branch carries the precommit reader from before U6.
- U6 changes `result_export`'s production code: the F5 exact `diagnostic_refs` list in `retained_precision.rs`, plus `semantic_contract.rs` and `derivative.rs`.
- No reviewed input changes. The one new `include_str!` is in a `#[cfg(test)]` module.
- The code that T17 prices does change. Under D-6's extension and QUALIFICATION.md §11, that is a re-qualification trigger.

**Ruled:** the memory branch does not merge into NUM until **U4 G7** (I65, `BRIEFS/I65_U4_G7_DELTA_REQUALIFICATION.md`, `d25d5393dc`) re-qualifies the registered profile on the integrated basis, and its delta is reviewed.
- **Pass A** works on the clean merge tree of `f172f86abe` and `0c7827b6ad` (`ba1faa1c…`, extracted read-only for I65).
- **Pass B** mechanically reruns Pass A's script on the final basis, after grant 2.
- **The reviewer of G7 is RV89,** which reviewed G5, G6 and the pre-registration delta. It is resumed when G7 returns.

**U3 grant 2 is adjusted (I61 informed):**
- D-U6-5's `include_str!` assertion is deferred, because U6's carrier fixtures are not on the memory branch.
- After grant 2 returns, ROOT commits it and merges NUM, with U6, into the memory branch.
- I61's short follow-on there adds D-U6-5 and reruns the permit-path tests and U5 on the merged base, where the precommit reader is U6's 07h reader.

**RV93 is briefed** (`BRIEFS/RV93_U3_GRANT2_REVIEW.md`, `501837c05b`) and is dispatched when grant 2 is committed.

## U4 G7 Pass A returned: the registered entry holds on the integrated basis; one tool defect and one completeness line, both to review (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I65's return** is `R/I65/u4_g7_01/` (RETURN.md `074d4b93…`, QUALIFICATION_G7.md `37b83fc1…`). SHA256SUMS: 78/78 OK, no unlisted files, no machine paths. The basis is tree `ba1faa1c…`; I65's copy equals it blob for blob. No source changed.

**I65's claims:**
- **The inventory.** 40 files changed, 3 of them production Rust (24 hunks).
  - **New and priced:** F5's two `Vec<&Value>` in `g5_ordinary`, +205,960 B in T17_V4.
  - **Dead on D1:** `semantic_contract`'s `is_retained` branches and their new `OnceLock` + `include_bytes!` static (at most 286,836 B if ever initialized). The `forbid_retained_*` checks run but allocate nothing.
  - **Unreachable:** `derivative.rs`.
- **Registered on the integrated basis:** the identity, the 14 inputs and the 4 layouts all equal the registered entry; `build_status()` is `Ok(0)`.
- **The maxima are unchanged:** 0.8881 / 0.8929 M, and the pinned record does not move.
- **TEXT is identical to G6:** TAV 2,150,800,830 / 1,570,041,862 / 1,440,401,002; all 2,807 rows match; the 7 new rows have multiplicity 0.
- **The enforced audit is clean** (11/11 controls). §11 is discharged by rerunning the by-type sweep (the same 410 non-candidates).
- **Witnesses, challenge and suites (registered) are outcome-identical to `0c7827b6ad`:** PP 699/1/10; runner 85/2.
  - Against NUM unregistered, the only differences are the 48 memory-branch tests.
- **The Pass B script** is `_run_records/g7_pass.sh`. It fails closed: exit 3 if the build is Stale, exit 4 if a rule's line falls in an edited hunk.

**I65's TEXT-tool finding (records tooling):**
- G6's `text_budget.py` passes multiplicity only between strongly connected components. U6's two lexical cycles made it silently zero everything below `for_source`; the first run came back TAV −112.85 MB, with no flag.
- G7's tool cuts `edge_zero` edges first, then fails on any multi-function cycle (control c9).
- G6's graph had no cycle, and the new tool reproduces G6's outputs exactly, so **G6's registered numbers stand, subject to review.**
- **Routed to RV87,** which reviewed the TEXT chain and the §11 sweep. RV87 checks:
  - that G6 had no such cycle;
  - that the cut-first rule is sound, edge by edge, on D1;
  - that the fail-closed check covers cycles the lexical graph could miss;
  - the 410-set and the explicit-row deferral.

**The completeness line (I65's proposal, `pass_a/proposal/t17_v4_f5.diff`):** T17_V4's census-20 coefficient goes from 57,880 to 83,625, folding F5 into the form.
- **The omission is not a safety gap.** The worst case at the caps is unchanged, and per-invocation bounds are monotone in the census. But a priced form that omits a real allocation sits against the standing constraint "Do not enable a permit on symbolic or partially priced terms."
- **Ruled: adopted, subject to RV89's confirmation** of the coefficient and of anything that must be regenerated with it. ROOT applies it on the memory branch after U3 grant 2 is committed, as a reviewed source change in U4's file. Pass B then runs on the final basis, including it.

**RV89 reviews the rest of Pass A:**
- reachability, above all that the `is_retained` branches and the new static are dead on every D1 input;
- that the integrated build is Registered, with RV89's own witness run;
- F5's counting rule, and whether V2_hash dominates V4 for every D1 census (V2_hash has no census-20 term);
- the proposal;
- the Pass B script.

The memory branch still merges into NUM only after grant 2, RV93, the D-U6-5 follow-on, Pass B, and these reviews.

## U3 grant 2 committed; RV93 dispatched; NUM merged into the memory branch; the D-U6-5 follow-on (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I61's return** is `R/I61/u3_grant2_01/` (SHA256SUMS 30/30 OK, no machine paths), with no stop.

**The milestone.** In the registered build, RF-SKEW-T-CANT-OFF-122-r1e-04 publishes U1's pinned successor through the actual Direct entry in both modes (sparse `ac6986b0…`, dense `6cd1d249…`), from exactly one ordinary run.

**The committed tests:**
- every W1 fallback gives the ordinary bytes plus exactly one N1 notice;
- every refusal before W1 work (G-A, G-C including `OrdinarySolveNotAttempted`, the stack, coexistence on n05) gives exact ordinary bytes;
- a G-B refusal is final and G-C is not consulted, which kills SV18;
- B′ holds, and so does B-1/S-7: one run, and no copy on the no-permit path;
- 11 of 11 mutants are killed.

**The controls:**
- **Unregistered or Stale:** all 324 outputs equal base.
- **Registered:**
  - every non-Direct route equals base;
  - Direct gives 2 successors, 4 Preparation notices (the `rejected_stress_range` fixtures, as in RV89 N-2) and 64 exact outputs.

**U5, rerun on the live successor bytes:**
- the report is byte-identical to U5's (97/97 class claims per mode);
- `u5_compare.py` now pins RV86's committed 7,240-byte extract (`a66a8a49…`, ROOT-checked);
- **RV86's limit 4 is discharged.**

**Not done:** optional item 7 (binding the permit to its invocation). It needs a `CapturePermit` change in U4's file. RV93 assesses the residual risk.

**ROOT's verification:**
- **The full diff:**
  - `lib.rs` gains two `#[cfg(test)]` statements on existing production lines, plus changes in the test-only `retained_tests_hooks` module;
  - `retained_product.rs` gains one `#[cfg(test)]` G-B hook;
  - `retained_tests_hooks/grant2.rs` is new and test-only;
  - five tests are new, and one comment changed.
- **Line-neutrality is deliberate,** so that U4's line-keyed TEXT inputs do not move.
- **ROOT's registered run:** PP 704 passed, 1 failed (t13), 10 ignored, with all five `u3g2_*` tests passing.

**Committed** as `664f8df7b7` on the memory branch (pushed).

**RV93** (fresh, `BRIEFS/RV93_U3_GRANT2_REVIEW.md`) is dispatched on `664f8df7b7`.

**NUM is merged into the memory branch** at `f8ce1eb32b` (clean). Its code delta is exactly U6's 40 files, and its code equals G7's Pass A basis `ba1faa1c…` plus grant 2, which ROOT checked by diff.

**I61's follow-on** (uncommitted in WT/f2a-memory at `f8ce1eb32b`; records in `R/I61/u3_grant2_02/`):
- **D-U6-5:** U6's two carrier fixtures equal the live successor bytes;
- reruns of the `u3g2_*` tests, PP, the 324-output sweep, U5 and the runner on the merged base, where the 07h reader runs at precommit. **Stop if the milestone no longer publishes its successor.**

**Then:**
1. ROOT commits the follow-on.
2. ROOT applies the T17_V4 line once RV89 confirms it.
3. G7 Pass B runs on the final basis.
4. RV93 extends its review to the follow-on delta.
5. RV89 confirms Pass B.

The memory branch merges into NUM after these.

## RV87 on G7 Pass A's TEXT-tool fix and §11: PASS; Pass B made fail-closed (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV87's report** is `R/REVIEW_RV87/u4_g7_01/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `3b9be056…`; SHA256SUMS 16/16 OK; no machine paths). Verdict: **PASS**, with 0 BLOCKING, 1 SHOULD-FIX and 4 NOTE findings.

**Independently confirmed:**
- **G6's graph had no multi-function cycle,** with or without the cuts, and G6's TEXT reproduces byte for byte on it. **G6's registered numbers were never affected.**
- **The cut-first rule is sound.** The 6 new cuts lie only in the `is_retained` branches of `for_source` and `for_source_metadata`. Those branches are dead on D1: `validate`'s G7 projection sets preview-physics-1 unconditionally (`retained_precision.rs:4253`).
- **The fail-closed check catches every cycle in the graph as built.** RV87's three controls fail as designed. The defect is general to G6's tool, which reports complete at −112.85 MB on the same synthetic edge.
- **The 7 new rows have multiplicity 0.** The call graph, lexicon and inventory regenerate byte-identical, and the four TEXT runs reproduce.
- **RV87's independent model re-derives every phase.** Only T17_V4 changes (F5). The maximum stays 0.8881 / 0.8929 M.
- **§11:** the 410 non-candidates are exactly RV87's, U6 adds no alias, and the explicit-row deferral is acceptable subject to SF-1.

**SF-1, ruled: fixed before Pass B is relied on.** `g7_pass.sh` runs with `set -u` only. It ignores `noncand_compare.py`'s verdict (`:63`) and reports incomplete TEXT, including an `scc` finding, only in its summary, so it exits 0. QUALIFICATION_G7 §4.2 says Pass B "stops", and the §11 deferral rests on that.
- **The fix (I65, records tooling only):** Pass B exits non-zero on any of:
  - a non-candidate set different from the reviewed 410;
  - incomplete TEXT;
  - an `scc` finding;
  - any other unverified verdict in its summary.
- **Each stop gets a control** that shows it firing.

**N-1, adopted in the same round.** Pass B also fails on any self-recursive text ancestor outside an approved list. The list is the 11 that G6 and G7 share, with the reason each one's text is priced elsewhere.

**N-2** (the check is only as complete as the call graph) **is stated in QUALIFICATION_G7 §4.1.**

**N-3** (any future basis needs G7's tool) and **N-4** (F5 is not yet in T17_V4, which is RV89's item) are noted.

**Batched with RV89's findings** on Pass A, which are pending, into one I65 repair round. Then Pass B runs on the final basis.

## The D-U6-5 follow-on committed: the milestone holds under U6's 07h reader (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I61's return** is `R/I61/u3_grant2_02/` (SHA256SUMS 19/19 OK; no machine paths). The stop condition did not trigger.
- **The milestone holds under U6's reader.** On the merged base, with U6's 07h reader at precommit, the actual Direct entry still publishes the milestone's successor in both modes, with U1's pinned bytes.
- **D-U6-5:** one test, `u3g2_d_u6_5_carrier_fixtures_are_the_live_successors` (test file only). U6's two carrier fixtures equal the live successor documents byte for byte, with U1's pinned file and receipt hashes. Two mutants are both killed.
- **The reruns match grant 2:**

  | Run | Result |
  |---|---|
  | PP, registered and Stale | 705 passed, 1 failed (t13), 10 ignored, outcome-identical |
  | runner/headless | 85 passed, 2 failed |
  | 324-output sweep, registered and Stale | byte-identical to grant 2's |
  | U5, on the live bytes through the 07h Python reader | byte-identical to U5's report, 97/97 per mode |

**ROOT's verification:**
- **The diff** is `retained_facade_tests.rs` only, +31 lines.
- **On the merged base,** the build-script identity and reviewed inputs equal the registered entry, and the six `u3g2_*` tests pass.

**Committed** as `f71478696b` on the memory branch (pushed).

**RV93 extends its review** to the follow-on delta (`f8ce1eb32b..f71478696b`) when its grant-2 review returns.

**Still before the memory merge:**
- RV89's review of G7 Pass A and the T17_V4 line;
- the I65 repair round (Pass B fail-closed: RV87 SF-1 and N-1, plus RV89's findings);
- the T17_V4 line;
- Pass B on the final basis.

## RV89 on G7 Pass A: PASS; T17_V4 line applied; Pass B hardened before reliance (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV89's report** is `R/REVIEW_RV89/u4_g7_01/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `7a35f12e…`; SHA256SUMS 25/25 OK; no machine paths). Verdict: **PASS**, with 0 BLOCKING, 1 SHOULD-FIX and 3 NOTE findings.

**Independently confirmed:**
- **The `is_retained` branches and the new static are dead on D1, hostile inputs included.**
  - **From the code:** PP calls into `result_export` only at `lib.rs:3161`. `validate` dispatches only `for_source(&projected)` (`retained_precision.rs:4305`), and `project` assigns the preview-physics-1 id (`:4252–4253`).
  - **By instrumentation:** 13 hostile in-D1 variants (26 runs) plus a 71-input sweep. Across 54 `validate` calls and 216 `is_retained` calls there were 0 true results and 0 static initializations. The positive control fires both counters.
- **The integrated build is Registered:** the identity, 14/14 input hashes and layouts match. RV89's own witnesses, challenge, PP 699/1/10 and runner 85/2 all match, and its sweep is byte-identical to G6's.
- **F5's pricing:** 8 × 25,745 = 205,960 B in V4, 1,131,825,961 B below V2_hash. Domination at every census is not needed: T17 is the max of the stages evaluated once at the caps, and s(&Value) = 8 is fixed by the identity.
- **The T17_V4 proposal is right and complete.** It is byte-identical to regeneration from G7's `profile_tree.json`; no FORMS pin exists; nothing moves.

**Applied.** The T17_V4 line (`t17_v4_f5.diff`, sha256 `5455cd5b…`) is committed as **`7f07a2f7b4`** on the memory branch (pushed).
- **ROOT's run:** PP 705 passed, 1 failed (t13), 10 ignored, with the challenge passing; witnesses 9/9.
- **The code delta** from Pass A's basis is exactly six PP files: grant 2, D-U6-5 and this line. It is extracted read-only for Pass B.

**S-1 (Pass B), ruled: hardened before reliance, together with RV87 SF-1 and N-1, in one I65 round** (`R/I65/u4_g7_02/`):
- a production-delta inventory that classifies every hunk; an unpriced D1-live hunk stops the run;
- one final verdict, with a non-zero exit on any delta: tree, statics, TEXT, outcomes, controls, §11, incomplete TEXT, `scc`;
- the entry compared byte for byte with `0c7827b6ad`'s, the threshold included; the FORMS block equal to regeneration; a gate on the law tests;
- D read from the run;
- the dead-branch premise pinned as rule lines: `project`'s literal-id lines and `validate`'s call;
- a stop on self-recursive text ancestors outside the approved 11;
- a control for each stop.

**N-2 is the reason the premise is pinned.** If the branch were ever live on D1, a second `validate` would push dense W4 to at least 3,749,527,510 B, above 0.9 M. The dead-branch argument therefore carries more weight than the static's size.

**N-1** (refs ≤ D_env rests on the producer's construction; at most 8 B) and RV87 N-2 are written into QUALIFICATION_G7. **N-3** is cosmetic.

RV89's copy under WT/rv89_g7 is kept for its confirmation of Pass B.

## G7 Pass B on the final basis: the registered entry holds; the only delta is the six added tests (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I65's return** is `R/I65/u4_g7_02/` (RETURN.md `637331ec…`; SHA256SUMS 139/139 OK; no machine paths). QUALIFICATION_G7.md in `u4_g7_01` is amended (that folder's SHA256SUMS re-verifies). No source changed.

**The hardened Pass B** gives a single verdict, with these stop codes:

| Exit | Stops on |
|---|---|
| 2 | tree |
| 3 | entry or law |
| 4 | line map or premise |
| 5 | an unreviewed production delta |
| 6 | any other delta |

- **RV89 S-1 (a)–(e)** are implemented:
  - every hunk is classified;
  - the entry is compared byte for byte with `0c7827b6ad`'s, threshold included;
  - the law tests gate the run;
  - FORMS must equal regeneration;
  - D is read from the run;
  - the premise is pinned at `retained_precision.rs:4252`, `:4253` and `:4305`.
- **RV87 SF-1 and N-1** are implemented: the §11 set, incomplete TEXT and `scc` findings stop the run, and so does a self-recursive text ancestor outside the reviewed 11.
- **Controls:** 33/33 on mutated copies.

**The final basis `7f07a2f7b4`:**
- **Exit 6.** The only delta is PP gaining 6 tests, all passing: grant 2's five `u3g2_*` and D-U6-5's.
- **The integrity gates hold:**
  - the tree, 2,950/2,950;
  - the entry, byte-identical to `0c7827b6ad`'s, M = 4,026,531,840 included;
  - the law tests, 42/42 with the registered tests;
  - no added statics;
  - the three premise pins.
- **TEXT is complete and identical to Pass A.** FORMS equals regeneration, §11 gives the same 410, and the controls pass 12/12.
- **The test gates hold:** witnesses 9/9, the challenge (peaks 3,541,898 / 2,252,863 B) and the runner are identical.
- **The maxima are unchanged:** 0.8881 / 0.8929 M.

The first final run stopped with exit 5, as designed, on grant 2's three `#[cfg(test)]` statements. I65 entered reviewed entries for them with evidence: absent from every non-test build, and allocation-free in the lib test binary whether armed or not. **Those entries are I65's own reading, so RV89 confirms them.**

`price_delta.py` double-counts F5 on the final tree. That only overstates, and is noted.

**Ruled: the six added tests are the expected delta.** They are ROOT-verified committed tests from grant 2 (`664f8df7b7`) and D-U6-5 (`f71478696b`). **The final basis is re-qualified** once RV89 confirms:
- the hardened script;
- the three reviewed entries;
- the final run.

The memory branch then merges into NUM, after RV93's review of grant 2 and the follow-on.

## RV93 on U3 grant 2: PASS; RV89 confirms the final basis re-qualified; U7 planned and ruled (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV93's report** is `R/REVIEW_RV93/u3_grant2_01/REVIEW.md` (sha256 `919a0cc5…`; SHA256SUMS 39/39 OK; no machine paths). It reviewed `664f8df7b7` against `0c7827b6ad`. Verdict: **PASS**, with 0 BLOCKING, 1 SHOULD-FIX and 6 NOTE findings.

**Independently established with RV93's own oracles** (process-global counters, a byte oracle for the notice, four sweeps, a permit log and a non-test example):
- **The milestone.** It publishes U1's pinned successor through the actual Direct entry in both modes (`cmp`-identical), from exactly 1 ordinary run, 1 solve, 1 G-B check and 1 G-C check, on the worker thread. A non-test build publishes the same bytes.
- **The readers.** Rust PASS. Python `_validate_draft` PASS.
- **U5.** It reproduces byte for byte.
- **Fallbacks and refusals.** Every fallback class, built by RV93, gives the plain bytes plus exactly one notice; Preparation and Candidate are also reached from real inputs. Every no-W1 refusal gives exact bytes.
- **The hooks** fire on the reserved-stack thread.
- **The sweep.** 468 rows, registered and Stale, equal base.
- **Permits.** None in the runner, against positive controls of 42 and 2.
- **Production text** is unchanged without the `cfg(test)` fragments.
- **Mutants.** 28 of 28 killed (I61's 11 plus 17 of RV93's).

**RV93's findings, ruled:**
- **S-1, recorded as test-only; no rename.** U4's tools would read `grant2.rs` as production. G7's hardened Pass B classifies it `test`, since it is declared only inside `#[cfg(test)] mod retained_tests_hooks`, and reports no statics added. RV89 confirmed by `nm` (no hook symbol in any non-test binary) and by a counting allocator (0 allocations).
- **N-1, accepted for the merge.** TypeScript was not run live. `retainedPrecision.test.ts:922` validates the real milestone receipts through U6's 07h TS reader, and D-U6-5 proves those fixtures equal the live bytes. The live TS rerun is U7's (RV92 N-8).
- **N-3, accepted:** RV85 U1's residual risk is not real in the registered build. The permit is crate-private and linear, with one constructor and one call site.
- **N-2, N-4 and N-6** are noted.
- **N-5, routed to U7's slice L** as optional: a real-input Candidate test.
- **RV93 extends its review** to `664f8df7b7..7f07a2f7b4`: the merge, D-U6-5 and the T17_V4 line, including a Precommit fallback triggered by the 07h F5 check.

**RV89's G7 addendum** is `R/REVIEW_RV89/u4_g7_01/ADDENDUM_01.md` (sha256 `89ce7538…`; SHA256SUMS 30/30 OK). Verdict: **PASS**, with 0 BLOCKING, 0 SHOULD-FIX and 2 NOTE findings.
- **The hardened Pass B gates fire as ruled.** RV89 ran them on its own logs and edited copies.
- **The three reviewed `#[cfg(test)]` entries are confirmed:**
  - absent from every non-test binary (`nm`);
  - 0 allocations in the lib test binary, unarmed and armed (the positive control registers 1);
  - no text added.
- **RV89's own registered build of `7f07a2f7b4`:**
  - PP 705 passed, 1 failed (t13), 10 ignored, differing from Pass A only by the six added tests;
  - law 42/0;
  - the record and the witnesses identical;
  - its sweep byte-identical to G6R's (`25cce1e1…`);
  - the entry equal to `0c7827b6ad`'s.
- **The final basis is re-qualified.**
- **N-4** (a reused tag can pass on stale outputs; the exit codes of the TEXT chain, §11 and controls are not gated) and **N-5** (the qualification's own law, witness and challenge test files are unguarded) **go to I65 before the next Pass B,** which is U7's slice Q.

**The memory branch merges into NUM** once RV93's extension passes.

**U7, I61's plan** (`R/I61/u7_scoping_01/PLAN.md`, sha256 `dce78f8f…`):
- The switch is three constants and their gates: PY `retained_precision.py:30`, RS `retained_precision.rs:4269` and TS `retainedPrecision.ts:97`.
- A live successor validated with its actual invocation then carries the standing `numerically_eligible`, in place of `needs_recompute`. TS reports it as `integrity_checked`.
- The plan inventories the preconditions (closed and open), slices A, T, P, F, L, Q and R, and the controls. The estimate is 11–16 agent-hours plus 4–7 hours of review.

**Decisions:**
- **D-U7-1, ruled as proposed.** U7 switches reader eligibility, in all three readers, for supplied statements with their invocations: library consumers and TS's seam path. It adds no product caller.
  - **Public activation** is ruled separately, later, with its own review: a product caller (native or desktop W1) publishing successors to users, with N-7's memoization and T6's outputs. This narrows RR:9250's wording; it does not expand scope.
  - Any supported-machine statement of M stays with the owner (decision 9).
- **D-U7-2:** snapshot 07i, a shared `eligible` expectation on the bases and must-pass entries, drawn from slice A's stdlib oracle.
- **D-U7-3, amended.** N-6 is **documentation only and line-neutral**: inline `#[doc]` on `into_parts()` (C-1) and on `successor()` (C-3).
  - `successor()` stays `pub`. It has three callers outside the crate: the registered runner test, the memory challenge and PP's admission integration test, so `pub(crate)` would break them.
  - It lands on the U7 branch, and Pass B covers it.
- **D-U7-4:** TS's N-2 strictness becomes a declared difference in the carrier case file. TS requires the live native capture, while Python and Rust require the actual invocation.
- **D-U7-5:** the order is slices A and T now, then the memory merge, then P and F. **F sets all three flags in one commit.**
- **D-U7-6, confirmed.** Eligibility is a property of a supplied statement and its invocation, with no producer-origin claim (C-2; `retained_precision.rs:4270–4271`). The standing text and the carrier scope must say so.

**The U7 branch** is `codex/piping-f2a-u7-20261004`, cut from NUM `071eec5c04`, in WT/f2a-u7. NUM is merged into it after the memory merge.

**Dispatched now:**
- **slice A (I61):** the inventory, plus a stdlib oracle of the expected eligibility and 07i's expectations, prepared as records;
- **slice T (I67):** RV91 N-2 = RV88 U6d S-1, RV91 N-5 and the token pin, in TS, uncommitted in WT/f2a-u7. ROOT adds the T6 notice for N-5;
- **I65:** RV89 N-4 and N-5 in the Pass B script, before slice Q.

**RV94** (fresh) reviews the whole switch after slices L and Q. RV89 confirms the U7 Pass B.

## U7 slice A returned: the switch inventory, the eligibility oracle and 07i prepared (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**I61's return** is `R/I61/u7_slice_a_01/` (RETURN.md `461cccb0…`; SHA256SUMS 8/8 OK; no machine paths). It is records only.

**The inventory:**
- the three flags and their gates;
- nine stale comments with proposed text; the two Rust ones are line-neutral;
- every eligibility pin in all three languages and in PP's `retained_wire_tests.rs:122`, each with its exact post-U7 value. **None is deleted;**
- every consumer that changes, and the unchanged ones: the derivative, row binding, transports, the packager and D-U6-9;
- the D-U7-6 sentences.

**The oracle.** `eligibility_oracle.py` is stdlib only and reads only the shared JSON. Its rules R0–R4 come from C1:160 and :162, D2 §4.9.4 and D-U6-1.
- **The pre-U7 self-check is exact:** 15/15 bases and 20/20 carrier standings.
- **After U7:**
  - 13/15 bases and 13/23 must-pass entries become eligible; the ones that don't have an unavailable case;
  - all 277 mutations stay `unsupported`;
  - 2 of 20 carrier cases change: the two `…:invocation` milestone cases go from `needs_recompute` to `numerically_eligible`;
  - the live milestone is `numerically_eligible` with its invocation and `needs_recompute` without it.

**07i's patch** (`u7_07i_expectations.patch`) reproduces the staged files byte for byte:
- **07i** `1e53ea9c…`, from 07h `d0a4ee21…`;
- **the case file** `f20a7db0…`, from `bbc05bd2…`.

Slice F's order is RETURN §3.

**N-6's diff** (`n6_docs_line_neutral.diff`) adds inline `#[doc]` on `lib.rs:2235` and `:2254`, keeps `pub`, and keeps the line count. It is for slice P.

**Rulings:**
- **The TS notice** (`knownSemanticLimitations.ts:168` summarizing without the model) goes to slice T. I67 decides whether to pass the model.
- **The corpus bases' `qualification` strings** ("DRAFT: … public API intentionally rejects"): **slice F updates any fixture or comment text that the switch makes false,** these strings included, if it does so. Otherwise they stay. RV94 checks that no stale claim remains.
- **I61's disclosure.** One snapshot command briefly wrote a copy of a committed repository test file to `/tmp/x`, which was deleted at once; ROOT confirms it is absent. This breached the host rule (nothing in the system temp directory). It is recorded, with no consequence: the file was a copy of committed content.

## The memory branch merged into NUM; U7 slices T and P committed (ROOT, 2026-10-04 UTC)

**RV93's addendum** is `R/REVIEW_RV93/u3_grant2_01/ADDENDUM_01.md` (sha256 `4d5a17cd…`; SHA256SUMS 58/58 OK). Verdict: **PASS** on `7f07a2f7b4`, with 0 BLOCKING, 0 SHOULD-FIX and 0 NOTE findings.
- **The milestone** still publishes U1's pinned successor under the 07h reader at precommit, in both modes and in a non-test build.
- **The 468-row sweep** is byte-identical, registered (`7955b640…`) and Stale (`d51c84d1…`).
- **A new F5-triggered Precommit fallback** gives the plain bytes plus one N1 notice. Its control: removing F5's line admits the edit.
- **D-U6-5:** 7/7 mutants killed.
- **PP** 705/1/10, registered and Stale; the maxima are unchanged.

**Merged: the memory branch into NUM at `3f5fca3010`** (U3 grants 1d and 2, D-U6-5, U4 G5–G7, the registration and the T17_V4 line). NUM's code is now byte-identical to the reviewed memory head `7f07a2f7b4`.

**ROOT's acceptance runs on NUM:**

| Suite | Result |
|---|---|
| The 24-file Python sweep plus the retained suites | 1,843 passed, 30 skipped, 0 failed |
| PP | 705 passed, 1 failed (t13), 10 ignored |
| runner/headless | 85 passed, 2 failed (known) |
| result_export | 168 passed |

**The milestone is met on the integration branch:** RF-SKEW-T-CANT-OFF-122-r1e-04 runs through the actual captured facade in both solver modes, under M03-INTEGRITY-MP-v2, matching its independent reference, with the refusal and coexistence controls preserved.

**I65's Pass B notes** are in `R/I65/u4_g7_03/` (RETURN.md `9a3516ab…`; SHA256SUMS 68/68 OK).
- **RV89 N-4 fixed:** the tag folder is cleared, and the TEXT chain, §11 and the controls run are now gated. The control proves the old script passed on stale outputs.
- **RV89 N-5 fixed:** qualification-test hunks need a reviewed entry, or the run exits 6.
- **The self-test** on `7f07a2f7b4` still gives exit 6 with exactly the six added tests. This is the Pass B tool for slice Q.

**U7 slice T (I67)** is in `R/I67/u7_slice_t_01/` (RETURN.md `652f75f0…`; SHA256SUMS 36/36 OK). The flags are unchanged.
- **RV91 N-2 = RV88 U6d S-1:** a would-be-eligible successor stands eligible only while the live native capture holds for these bytes and the current model. Otherwise it reads `needs_recompute` with `RETAINED_PRECISION_NATIVE_CAPTURE_REQUIRED`.
- **RV91 N-5:** the explicit `loadReferenceOutputRefusal(result) !== null` gate on both panels.
- **RV92 N-8:** standing maps by token through the pinned `RETAINED_STANDING_STATUS`.
- **The notices** keep omitting the model, which is justified and pinned: `withheld` is never displayed.
- **Tests and mutants:** vitest 3,531/3,531 (3,494 existing tests with unchanged outcomes, plus 37 new); tsc clean; 80 envelopes identical on unforced paths; 136/136 mutants killed by assertion.
- **ROOT read the production diff and committed it** as `0ca5449c87` on the U7 branch.

**NUM is merged into the U7 branch** at `1d93b6f022`. Its code is NUM plus slice T.

**Slice P** is committed as `12a849a7bd`: I61's N-6 text applied by ROOT, line-neutral (`lib.rs` stays 24,333 lines), compiling clean. `successor()` and `into_parts()` stay `pub`.

**Rulings on slice T's questions:**
- **The D-U7-4 entry's format: adopt I67's draft fields** (`capture: "none"`, `current_model_edits`).
  - The case file's format moves to **v4**.
  - All three languages' declared-difference consumers read v4 and the new fields explicitly, with no silent ignore. Python and Rust assert their side (`numerically_eligible` with the actual invocation); TS asserts `needs_recompute` with the new finding.
  - I66 applies this in slice F, and I67 completes TS.
- **The `liveStressBinding` export is accepted** as the test seam. Its comment says why it is exported; RV94 checks it.
- **The T6 notice** for N-5 is posted in the work graph's T6 row: T6's successor outputs must replace the explicit refusal deliberately, under their own review.

**Next: slice F part 1 (I66),** under `BRIEFS/U7_SLICE_F_SWITCH.md`, in WT/f2a-u7 at `12a849a7bd`.
