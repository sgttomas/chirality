# PR-B1: change record

**This PR brings B1 to main: up to three load cases (C = 3) in one retained-precision invocation, at I82's option S3, through the retained route.** It is B1's compact PR under PLAN_v2 §6 (`R/I84/b1_plan_01/PLAN_v2.md`, `c85786b7…`). The reviews are agent reviews, not personal review by the owner.

**Status of this file.** I108 (SK) drafted it, records only, from the records named here. The PR-head gates run before the merge and are recorded in the merge record on the integration branch.
- **The code commit** is `d07006c2f0` on `codex/piping-t3-pr-b1-20261008`, cut from main `3d73db745e`. It carries the 33 maintained files that NUM `75cd6be76b` changes (RR "I108's package returned; the `threshold_bytes` citation corrected; PR-B1 recut from main `3d73db745e` with a true message").
- **NUM carries B1:** `b1` `ddc8eaaf54` (R6b's registration) merged as `fd62a11046`, then main `6c821d9ccf` as `a41eea7b5f`. `75cd6be76b` then corrects the `threshold_bytes` comment, which now cites RR "R6b: RV124 passes SQ and confirms M". That is a two-line comment change; `retained_memory.rs` is not a reviewed input.
- **Main:** NUM's main base is `6c821d9ccf`. The PR's main, `3d73db745e`, adds #1153 (App v4 only: 179 paths, none under P), so it touches none of the 33.

**Notation:** P = `projects/chirality-piping`; PP = `P/core/product_physics`; RE = `P/core/reporting/result_export`; DT = `P/apps/desktop/src/features/results`; AR = `P/core/analysis_runs`; RR = T3's append-only `ROOT_RULINGS_V1.md` (an RR "title" names a heading); R = T3's `RESUME_2026-09-30` records on NUM; T = T3's folder on NUM. DESIGN = `R/I78/b0_contract_01/DESIGN_v2.md` (`5933b90b…`); QUAL = main's `IMPLEMENTATION/F2A_D1/copies/QUALIFICATION.md`.

**The slice history** is on `b1` (`codex/piping-t3-b1-20261007`) through `ddc8eaaf54`: ST, SP, SA, SR-RS, SR-PY, SR-TS, SC and SQ, integrated at I1–I4′ and R6b. The PR carries none of it.

## 2. What it does

**C = 3 at S3, through the retained route.**
- **Admission (SA):** `LOAD_CASES` = 3 and `TOTAL_LOADS` = 384 at D1's model caps (n = m = g = 32, Σr = 192, l = 128). D1.4 admits 1 to C cases with no combination or component; D1.5 and D1.7 hold per case; G-B and G-C are priced at C = 3. G-B's byte bound is T11 less one case's late capture (RV112 SF-1, at SQ).
- **The producer (ST, SP):** DESIGN T-1 to T-13.
  - **T-4:** a case whose ordinary verdict is `checks_passed` is not attempted (decision 21). With no attempted case, `NoTriggeredCase` publishes the exact ordinary bytes, with no W1 work.
  - The attempted cases are prepared in request order, solved in one native batch call, frozen per case, staged and serialized in request order. On a fallback, one N1 notice is published per attempted case (T-12).
  - c = 1 runs through the same n-case path. Every committed c = 1 successor pin is byte-identical (RV109 rounds 1 and 2).
- **T-11's headline staging, a clarification of DESIGN.** At c ≥ 2, each summary headline is recomputed as the governing row over the staged rows: greatest value, then the smaller case id, then location (RR "SP returned before I3; the headline rule accepted; …").
- **A latent defect of main, repaired.** `retained_wire.rs` wrote `constructor_ordinal` as the term's canonical position, while all three readers derive the authored ordinal. An in-domain case whose loads were not authored in canonical order fell back at precommit G8 with one notice. That was fail-safe, but it denied a certified successor in main's registered dev/test build. The producer now writes `t.original`. No committed byte changes, because every pin was authored in canonical order (RR "I98's B2-W verified; …", ruling 4; RV109 round 2 ADDENDUM_01).
- **The Direct entry, in the registered dev/test build only.** `threshold_bytes` = 11,274,289,152 B (M = 10.5 GiB; R6a, final at R6b).
  - In-build E_mov,max + R is 9,800,676,166 B sparse (0.8693 M) and 9,859,807,510 B dense (0.8745 M), W3 binding.
  - The text-error budget is 8.05 % sparse and 6.67 % dense.
  - Every other build is Stale and publishes the ordinary bytes (SG's Stale sweep is byte-identical to base).
- **The witnesses publish.** W-C2 (A selected, B `not_required`, C unavailable at Ceiling) publishes in both modes, pinned as the two new fixtures. So does the cap-maximal three-case input (|A| = 3, Σ l_i = 384; QUAL_B1 §4).

**The three readers' eligibility.** RS, PY and TS read an n-case successor and agree on every gate and code, apart from the declared raw G7 codes.
- **SR's alignment:** D38's (4b) relaxation; F-1 text B per case; G5's `not_required` rule; G8 per case.
- **The three-reader alignment set** (RR "RV113's three returns verified; …"): the (f) family at G3; the (g) model-scope members at G8; C2's cause table at G5; the transport header at G2 and the metadata at G7.
- **I4′** (RR "I4 made at `30f3d1b24a`; …", rulings 1–5): Rust's header order in PY, the extrema-number demand, the multiset rule, and C2's kernel row.
- **Four base-reader edits are ruled in:** PY's `_source_contract` guards; PY's header order (retained transport only); PY's multiset rule; TS's extrema-number demand. Each refuses only shapes the producer cannot emit; all 126 extrema records in the committed fixtures carry numbers (RV120 `rvr_i4p_01`).

**07n.** The corpus grows to 26 cases (+9), 534 mutations (+240) and 78 must-pass entries (+50); the 07m prefix is unchanged.

**Also:**
- RV95 N-5's direct unit test of `source_blocks::integer`'s 2^53−1 bound (I74 decision 9);
- RV97 R2-N-2's module doc;
- I77's two code-line citations as symbols (`zz_rv93_input_fallbacks`, `w6_input()`);
- E-12: rule 8 now scans `retained_product.rs`.

## 3. What it does not do

- **No product caller** of the retained entries (SG gate 4). The native commands are unchanged.
- **No public activation:** that is B8's, and successors are not public before it.
- **No supported-machine statement.** That is owner-held. R9's reading is in RR "SQ complete; R9 read; …", and RSS_TIME §5 states the non-claims: no 16 GB behaviour observed, no concurrency claim, and M is not an RSS bound.
- **Not B2, B3, S-I2, F2b or F3.** D1.4 still refuses a combination or a component, and D1.5 still refuses pressure regions (SG gates 1 and 3).
- **No FK, schema, `Cargo.lock`, reviewed-input or D1-visibility change.** None of the 33 files is FK, a schema, `Cargo.lock` or a reviewed static.
- **T6S is untouched:** one T6S test file gains one line outside T6S's block. The c = 1 successors are unchanged, so T6S-2's goldens stand (PLAN_v2 §3.12).
- **The disclosed limit (F-1 text B, with RV113 N-4's wording).** A dense case's parity row deleted, with the receipt resealed including its row indices, is admitted and eligible.
- **R-b′:** the whole invocation is abandoned on an unrecoverable fault. This is a known limit (DESIGN §7, RV105 N-5).
- **About 30 KB of B1's heap is unpriced** (RV124 Q-N1: `Vec<CaseAttempt>`, 28,200 B at |A| = 3, and small O(c) locals). That is against 287,052,726 B of dense margin, and M is unaffected. It goes to SB with that bound.

## 6. B1's evidence, by citation

| Evidence | Record |
|---|---|
| **QUAL_B1,** with M's ruling and the text-error budget | `copies/QUAL_B1.md` = `R/I104/b1_sq_01/QUAL_B1.md` (`eb6541fc…`), §3 and §6. M: RR "R6a: …" and "R6b: …"; RV124 §2 |
| **QUAL §7 for B1 (Q-N3): the identifier audit** | G5's TEXT enforces the audit on B1's code. 12 of 12 controls pass: the unmodified run is complete, and each of the 11 altered runs is incomplete with its own finding (`R/I104/b1_sq_01/_run_records/g5/g5_c3/audit_controls.out.txt`). RV124 §1.6: removing any of I104's five new `id_audit` entries, or the terminal-kind static rule, makes TEXT incomplete at that site. The 4 new non-candidates, read by type, carry no identifier alias (QUAL_B1 §11; RV124 §8) |
| **QUAL §9 for B1 (Q-N3): the controls** | The registration in a copy: PP 741 passed, 1 failed (Mac `t13`), 79 ignored (QUAL_B1 §8; RV124 §3). The unregistered and Stale fixture sweep moved to SG gate 3. The other crates' suites moved to the pre-freeze suite and DEC-025. The mutants: SQ's G04, and RV124's 21 (20 killed, M17 equivalent by data, Q-N4), with each slice's set in its return and review. Pass B's controls are SB's |
| **The generator and the profile tree** | Generator `R/I104/b1_sq_01/_run_records/chain/g5_profile.py` (`a8882aba…`, the same bytes as main's `F2A_D1/copies/g5_profile.py`). Tree `_run_records/g6/n5/g5_c3/profile_tree.json` (`46dd2546…`), with N-5's `g6/tools/sq_n5_chain.py`. RV124 §1.1 regenerated the committed block from it byte for byte |
| **`registration.diff`** | `copies/registration.diff` = `R/I104/b1_sq_01/registration.diff` (`d85101ea…`), one hunk, applied as `b1` `ddc8eaaf54`. It is SQ's historical diff: its comment's citation was corrected on NUM at `75cd6be76b` |
| **The witness logs** | `R/I104/b1_sq_01/_run_records/g6/witnesses/` (dev/test and release): 40 of 40 entry points pass in both builds (QUAL_B1 §4). RV124 §5 reran 51 dev/test entry points |
| **The challenge** | `PP/tests/retained_memory_challenge.rs`; every peak is within its A1-S-1 bound, the largest 113.3 MiB against E_mov,max (RSS_TIME §2; `_run_records/g6/rss/`; RV124 §6) |
| **RSS_TIME, with R9's reading** | `copies/RSS_TIME.md` = `R/I104/b1_sq_01/RSS_TIME.md` (`f230c7ec…`). R9: RR "SQ complete; R9 read; …". The largest RSS at the caps is 206.5 MiB; the priced worst case is 9.18 GiB; release wall time is at most 1.77 s |
| **07n's parity** | RV120 `sc_01/REVIEW.md`: 1,218 checks per reader, 0 misses; TS = PY on all 1,914 verdicts; RS differs only on 46 entries' declared raw G7 codes; 07m's 339 entries unchanged. Records: I100 `b1_sc_01/RETURN.md` (`a4bd24f9…`); I101 `b1_sc_pins_01/` (`6343e404…`, ADDENDUM_01 `ba4f17ab…`) |
| **The W-C2 pins** | I85 `R/I85/b1_sp_01/I3_01.md` §2 (`5084603d…`): document = fixture `7922e3e5…` / `f2800bd4…`; published bytes `c7a18593…` / `a77c010b…` (sparse / dense). RV109 round 2 ADDENDUM_01 rebuilt both byte for byte; SG gate 2 matched them |
| **RV95 N-5's direct test** | I90 `R/I90/b1_sr_rs_01/RETURN.md` §3.5 (`29eb10a3…`); RV113 SR-RS §7. It kills S1 and the off-by-one, and covers the 13 receipt fields, `failure.block_order` included. It calls `integer` directly, and a census binds every call site; it does not take the composite receipt's path. RV125 reads the test against DESIGN §7's composite-receipt clause |
| **RV97 R2-N-2** | `a4eab1dd01`. The module doc of `RE/tests/retained_precision_contract.rs` now says the two L = 0 bases were published by the Direct entry in the registered dev/test build, and that reading the controls establishes no execution |

**`citations.json`** (#1082's format) is pinned at NUM `75cd6be76b`. Its documents table is #1082's 23 names, unchanged.
- **The run** (`--base 3d73db745e --head d07006c2f0`, `_draft_run_records/outputs/check_pr.out`): 71 record and RR citations (28 distinct) and 27 document citations; 98 resolved, 0 ambiguous, 0 unresolved, 0 verification failures. **PASS.**
- **Three negative controls** each fail, as they should: a missing entry (UNRESOLVED), R6b's entry pointed at R6a's heading line, and a changed copy (each FAILED).

## 7. Routed notes

- **SQ2:** B1's +112 MB over I82's pricing uses part of B3-S's headroom. SQ2 prices B3 on B1's real profile and may select 10.75 GiB; B3b-A stays provisional (RR "R6a: …").
- **B2 (DEF-O):** any DEF-O revision covers the MPa ×1e6 projection beside NC-1's mm→SI (RV124 Q-N2; RR "R6b: …").
- **B2:** combination coverage comes at G3 with B2's contract, which also changes (g)'s `combinations` and `components` rule (RR "RV113's three returns verified; …", item 2; RR "I91's and I92's rounds verified; …", ruling 2).
- **B3:** B3a changes (g)'s `pressure_contract` rule (the same item). RV78-N1's preview-table bindings go to `physics-retained-1` (RR "I86's SW probe accepted; …", ruling 1).
- **B3 (`b2`):** a three-reader disagreement at G8's sourced-case check predates B3 and is with I100. PR-B1's readers equal main's there (RR "PR-B1 cut (`8248921552`); …").
- **Outside B2, B3 and SQ2:**
  - F2b gets the per-term `constructor_ordinal` (RV109 round 2 ADDENDUM_01 N-1);
  - B7 gets one Rust source for the transport metadata check (RR "I90's SR-RS repair round 2 verified; …", ruling 1);
  - SB (I107) gets Q-N1 and Q-N5, and PLAN_v2 §2.3's phase-4 check as Pass B's item 10: RetainedErrorTextBytes ≤ C·(3m + 1)·Text(err) against SP's producer (RR "I108's package returned; …", item 4);
  - RV-X (RV125) gets RV120 N-2 (a negative or zero bound is admitted), RV109 round 2's N-1, and DESIGN §7's composite-receipt clause for N-5's test (the same ruling, item 5);
  - the owner's machine-adaptive memory budget study comes after PR-B1 (RR "#1114 merged; …").
- **Not taken, optional:**
  - a Direct-entry variant with a fault armed (RV109 round 2 ADDENDUM_01 N-2; SQ item 10);
  - the per-call observation rule, about −150 MB (RR "R6a: …").
