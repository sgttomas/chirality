# T3 handoff to the next ROOT — 2026-10-05

**Handed off at the owner's request.**
- **Nothing is running:** no TASK, compiler, solver or test. The memory guard stays running.
- **The F2a D1 milestone is on main** (PR #1082).
- **U8 is planned and ruled, and its briefs are ready.** Nothing is dispatched.
- **The host was cleaned** (about 0.5 TiB freed), and every T3 branch is pushed.

You continue as **HELP_HUMAN, Type 0, Agent 0 (ROOT)** for T3, under the owner's standing directions and delegated technical authority ("carry on with T3 in the manner you see fit"). The workflow in use is `coordinated-knowledge-work` (Root `workflows/`).

## Start here

1. **The instructions:** Root `AGENTS.md`, `agents/AGENT_HELP_HUMAN.md` and `projects/chirality-piping/AGENTS.md`.
2. **This handoff,** then [ROOT_CURRENT](RESUME_2026-09-30/ROOT_CURRENT.md) and the [glossary](RESUME_2026-09-30/GLOSSARY.md).
3. **The latest rulings** in [ROOT_RULINGS_V1.md](ROOT_RULINGS_V1.md), which is append-only. Read from "U9 planned and ruled" to the end. The decisive ones:
   - "DEC-025 on F finds a test-walker defect; repaired and refrozen as F′ = 5488136a19";
   - "#1082 merged at F′: the F2a D1 milestone is on main";
   - "Owner decision: F2a's delivery steps move to the end of F2a; erratum E-1";
   - "I61's U8 plan ruled; the owner pulls T6's successor-output slice forward; dispatches prepared for the handoff".
4. **The plan:** [`R/I61/u8_plan_01/PLAN.md`](RESUME_2026-09-30/I61/u8_plan_01/PLAN.md), covering U8, the F2a-breadth roadmap (B0–B8), S-I1's readiness, and absorbing main.
5. **The briefs** in `RESUME_2026-09-30/BRIEFS/`: `U8_COMMON.md`, I68–I74 and RV97–RV99.
6. **The merged milestone's package:** `IMPLEMENTATION/F2A_D1/CHANGE_RECORD.md` (scope §4, obligations §5) and the merge record `IMPLEMENTATION/F2A_D1_MERGE/` (RECORD, ERRATA).
7. **The records merge:** `IMPLEMENTATION/RECORDS_MERGE_2026-10-05/` on NUM. The outgoing ROOT's last act was a records-only PR bringing NUM's execution records to main, and this record says whether it merged. **Check it first.**

**Notation:** P = `projects/chirality-piping`; T3 = this directory; R = `T3/RESUME_2026-09-30`; RR = the rulings file.

## The host (check it first)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Machine** | The M5 Max, 128 GiB. All heavy work runs here |
| **WT** | `/Users/ryan/dev/chirality/.claude/worktrees/swbpipe-control-layer-8a41be/.claude/t3` |
| **NUM** | `WT/numerics`, branch `codex/piping-numerical-integrity-20260926`, the T3 integration branch. Its maintained source equals main's; only records differ |
| **The DEC-025 tree** | `WT/sweep-skewpin`, detached. Check out the candidate head and keep it clean. After each run, move the sweep's summary JSON out to the run's scratch folder |
| **Worktrees** | Only these two remain under WT. Create others per unit (e.g. `WT/f2a-u8`, `WT/s-i1`) and remove them when merged |
| **The memory guard** | `WT/guard/memguard.sh`, PID 5387 at handoff; check with `pgrep -f memguard.sh`. It must run during any build |
| **VENV** | `/Users/ryan/dev/chirality/.claude/worktrees/swbpipe-control-layer-8a41be/projects/chirality-piping/.venv` |
| **node_modules** | The parent checkout's `projects/chirality-piping/node_modules`, linked into a worktree by an untracked symlink, which you remove before removing the worktree |
| **DEC-025 tooling** | `WT/scratch/u9_dec025/dec025_mac.sh` (sha `9e34865b…`, unchanged from `M03_SKEW_PIN_MERGE`); the quiet-host wrapper `run_all.sh`; the suite runner `WT/scratch/calib/run_suites_nff.sh`. Copies are in `IMPLEMENTATION/HANDOFF_2026-10-05/host_tools/`. The per-test comparator is `IMPLEMENTATION/F2A_D1_MERGE/dec025/compare_suites.py` |
| **Cleanup** | `WT/tools/t3_cleanup.py`; procedure in `IMPLEMENTATION/HANDOFF_2026-10-05/CLEANUP.md` |
| **Evidence that exists only on disk** | `WT/scratch` (about 44 GB) and `WT/preserved-evidence`. Never pruned without the owner |

## What is done

- **#1082 merged** at 2026-10-05T01:09:29Z as `0b00b8e8b6` (parents M `5fdc5ab601` and F′ `5488136a19`). What it delivers:
  - the milestone RF-SKEW-T-CANT-OFF-122-r1e-04 through the Direct entry, both modes, in the registered dev/test build only (M = 4,026,531,840 B);
  - three-language reader eligibility, and the carriers.
  
  **No product caller exists.**
- **The first freeze failed, and was repaired.** DEC-025 on F caught a test-walker defect in nonlinear_integration, repaired test-only, and the head was refrozen as F′. **Rule since then: the full 40-manifest suite runs before any freeze.**
- **Erratum E-1:** the 9 ignored PP `witness_*` tests are U4's stack witnesses, not U8's.
- **NUM has absorbed main** through `e916ad1789` (#1083). Every T3 branch is on origin.
- **I61 planned U8 and the rest of F2a.** ROOT ruled all 13 ROOT decisions as recommended. The owner decided the 14th.

## Owner decisions in force

**Dated:**
- **2026-10-04: main held for #1082.** The hold ended at the merge, and the owner was told.
- **2026-10-04: the native witness (G10) stays outstanding on the owner's Mac.** It covers the milestone on the ordinary route, and the export panels refusing a successor.
- **2026-10-05: the F2a order:**
  1. U8;
  2. F2a's numerical breadth on the dev/test build;
  3. the release identity, registered once (B7);
  4. public activation with native Current (B8);
  5. S-I2, F2b per family, and F3.
  
  S-I1 runs alongside.
- **2026-10-05: the T6 successor-output slice is pulled forward,** to run in parallel. It closes activation checklist item 4.
- **2026-10-05: cleanup.** Remove what is regenerable, periodically. Removing evidence is the owner's call.

**Earlier:**
- T1 option (a);
- D-3 = S1 (a reserved stack plus a witness);
- D-6 = (a) (a fail-closed build check);
- M selected under D-7.

**Owner-held, and not yours to decide:**
- dense and lane ceilings;
- PHYS-R4 named refusal and availability;
- observation framing;
- the KF3 lambda split;
- the KF2 dense screen;
- any supported-machine statement of M, or M above the provisional 3.75 GiB;
- any change to public meaning;
- the native-app witnesses, which need the owner's Mac.

## The next work, in order

1. **Verify the state:**
   - the guard is running;
   - `git -C WT/numerics worktree list`;
   - NUM's and main's heads;
   - the records-merge record;
   - free disk space.
2. **Absorb main into NUM** if main moved, using PLAN §4's dry run. Flag:
   - any of the 140 S files;
   - any crate in PP's dependency closure;
   - PP's `Cargo.lock` or the 13 reviewed statics. A change to any of these makes the registered build Stale until it is re-registered.
3. **U8** (`BRIEFS/U8_COMMON.md`):
   1. Cut `codex/piping-f2a-u8-<date>` from NUM into `WT/f2a-u8`.
   2. Dispatch **I68 Part 1** (the probe), then rule on its outcomes. Those decide whether L = 0 publishes and what W-C1's reason is.
   3. Then I68 Part 2.
   4. Only if L = 0 publishes: **I69**, then **I70** and **I71**.
   5. Then **I72** (Pass B) and **RV97** (the review). RV98 confirms Pass B. Each repair is confirmed by the same reviewer.
   6. Then the full 40-manifest suite, and the freeze.
   7. **U8's own compact PR** from main: source equality and a small evidence package, as #1082 did. Its gates are hosted CI with the full-SHA dispatch (`target_base` = main), GEN-8, and DEC-025 against a fresh Mac baseline of main.
   8. Merge with `--match-head-commit` after checking main has not moved, and write the post-merge record on NUM.
4. **In parallel, S-I1** (`BRIEFS/I73_S_I1.md`, `RV99_S_I1_REVIEW.md`): branch `codex/piping-s-i1-<date>` from main into `WT/s-i1`, with its own PR. It needs no D1 gates, but does need DEC-025 and hosted CI. **One cargo job at a time across U8 and S-I1: you order them.**
5. **In parallel, the T6 slice plan** (`BRIEFS/I74_T6_SUCCESSOR_SLICE_PLAN.md`). Rule on it, then dispatch its implementation with its own reviewer and PR.
6. **Then breadth:** B0 (reserve `openpipestress.result_semantics/0.3.0/physics-retained-1`) → B1 and B6 (W-C2, D38's pin, and early in B1 the cap-growth study) → PR-B1 → B2 and B3 → B4 if ruled → PR-B2 → B7 → B8 → S-I2 → F2b per family → F3.
   - **Re-qualify once per PR candidate** on the registered identity: TEXT, the identifier audit, Pass B and an independent confirmation, plus the G5/G6 work for a widening.
   - **B8 needs** caller qualification for the desktop workspace (RR:10407), I53's open native-window premise, and the owner's Mac.

**Assignment IDs.** Use the prepared IDs I68–I74 and RV97–RV99 as fresh instances; an ID is a records folder and a role, not a memory. The next unused are **I75 and RV100**. RV96 is the outgoing ROOT's records-PR reviewer.

## Rules that continue

- **Git:**
  - TASKs make no Git writes; ROOT commits, merges and pushes;
  - never rebase or force-push; merge with `gh pr merge --merge --match-head-commit`, after checking `origin/main` has not moved;
  - no auto-merge;
  - merges use the owner's standing authorization (AGENTS.md): required CI passes, and independent review has no unresolved blocking finding on the actual candidate.
- **PR packaging.** A product PR is cut compactly from main, with maintained-source equality to the integration head (`source_equality.py` in `IMPLEMENTATION/F2A_D1/`), a concise evidence package, and checked citations. Records reach main only through a separate records-only PR.
- **Gates before a main merge:**
  - a fresh independent complete-diff review, with same-reviewer repair confirmation;
  - hosted CI and the full-SHA dispatch;
  - the full 40-manifest suite before the freeze;
  - an exact-final-head Mac DEC-025, compared per manifest and per test (`compare_suites.py`) against a fresh baseline of current main;
  - GEN-8;
  - for D1-call-graph changes, Pass B with an independent confirmation, plus T9 and the both-entry gates where product behaviour can change.
  
  A carry-over by ruling needs a stated premise and the reviewer's confirmation.
- **DEC-025 runs on a quiet host:** the wrapper waits for six quiet samples, with a fresh target, and nothing else builds meanwhile. Tell reviewers not to build during the window.
- **Records:**
  - placeholder paths, and SHA256SUMS per folder;
  - the rulings stay append-only;
  - corrections are errata, not edits;
  - add records with explicit paths. A `git add -A` over records swept in a TASK's in-progress file once.
- **Never:** solver-at-scale or native jobs by TASKs; installs; writes to the system temp directory.

## Lessons from the last session

- **A test in one crate can pin another crate's source.** nonlinear_integration's module walker reads PP's source. The integration branch ran PP, runner, result_export, Python and TS only, so the walker defect went unnoticed until DEC-025. Hence the full-suite rule.
- **Label tests from their source, not from memory.** That caused erratum E-1.
- **The cleanup tool's first plan would have deleted tracked record folders inside worktrees.** Always plan, read the plan, then apply. The tool now refuses tracked paths.
- **Ask the owner early** when a decision blocks a far-off step but affects parallel scheduling. The T6 pull-forward was decided as soon as the plan showed it.

## Open items not yet in a brief

- **G10:** the native witness, on the owner's Mac.
- **Routed notes:**
  - RV94 N-5 (Python ignores `expected_by_reader`);
  - RV95 N-2 (citation forms);
  - Pass B's attribution of deletion-only hunks;
  - RV95 B-1, C-1 and C-2 (optional walker hardening);
  - RV89 N-1 (handled in I72's brief).
- **RV95 N-6:** re-establish the milestone's bytes and verdicts on any further registered identity (B7).
- **The public-activation checklist,** in CHANGE_RECORD §4.
