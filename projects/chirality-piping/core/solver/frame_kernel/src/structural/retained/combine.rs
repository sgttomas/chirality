//! K4: combinations (T3 D1 §4.1.1 and §4.1.2, as refined by ROOT's ruling on
//! I12's A1 finding F-1).
//!
//! **A combination is its own solve.** "Its right-hand side is one exact
//! expansion of the combined ledger Σcᵢfᵢ and the combined prescribed coupling,
//! rounded once to p. Its prescribed values are the exact combination, rounded
//! once. It reuses the cached factor of the shared stiffness source, and runs
//! its own schedule and stop rule. The operands' results never change." The
//! combined ledger holds the exact products cᵢ·v of every operand's load terms
//! (`RetainedLedger::combined`); each prescribed value is the exact sum of the
//! products cᵢ·vᵢ, rounded once at p (`CasePrep::combination`). The combination
//! then runs the case schedule (`run_schedule`) over 128, 256 and 512, each
//! verified at 2p, ceiling 1024, with the stop rule and S\* of its own values:
//! "its published outputs go through the stop rule exactly as case outputs do,
//! with S\* taken from the combination's own body scale", and "a combination
//! whose candidates disagree escalates independently of its operand cases. At
//! the ceiling, it is withheld … (reason `combination_unresolved`), and its
//! operand cases keep their standing."
//!
//! The former formation Σcᵢ·uᵢ of the operands' retained states is withdrawn
//! (ROOT, F-1): with one linear K the two agree in exact arithmetic, but Σcᵢuᵢ
//! loses operand loads that cancel below both p's and 2p's resolution, and
//! the stop rule cannot see a loss common to both. No operand state is used,
//! so no operand is solved on demand.
//!
//! Rules: the operands are case solves (not combinations) sharing one
//! stiffness identity (nodes, members, springs, directional springs and the
//! constrained DOF set), one published layout, and the same stations and
//! support groups (ROOT's ruling on RV19-3: a station's fraction and a group's
//! members are not in the layout, which holds only their ids). The combination's shared
//! stages at p come from the operands' caches when any of them built (or
//! failed) them, and are counted in full against the combination's case limit
//! and against the invocation only when built here, as for any case of a
//! group.
