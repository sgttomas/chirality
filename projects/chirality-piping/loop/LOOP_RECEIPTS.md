# Piping Loop Receipts

> **Epistemic status: derivative handoff ledger — not authority.** Append-only.
> Current state is always re-derived from the live tree, the decision register,
> the approved DAG, deliverable-local `_STATUS.md` files, git history, and the
> deterministic checks; on any disagreement those sources govern (K-AUTH-1). A
> receipt records only what tools cannot re-derive: owner directions given
> outside governed artifacts, gate outcomes and their rationale, deltas found in
> dated maps (which are never edited), and pointers to the authoritative
> artifacts created elsewhere.

## Rules (fixed — part of the loop protocol)

1. **Pointer, not narrative.** Prefer paths, PR numbers, commit SHAs, decision
   IDs, and TP/test-plan IDs. Work history lives in commits, PRs, decision
   records, run records, and deliverable-local files — never here.
2. **Owner directions verbatim.** Any owner direction not otherwise captured in
   a governed artifact is quoted word-for-word with its date. This is the one
   place chat-only directions become durable. Exception (owner-ruled
   2026-07-10): a direction whose entire content and outcome are re-derivable
   from git/PR history — e.g. "merge PR #N", executed as the recorded merges —
   needs no receipt entry; rule 1 governs (work history lives in commits and
   PRs). Quote a merge direction only when it carries anything beyond the
   merge itself (scope grants, conditions, follow-on instructions).
3. **Measurements as check summaries only.** `self-check pass; harness pytest
   pass; deliverable-status summary run; work-type checks pass` is the maximum —
   counts and tables belong in run records and evidence artifacts.
4. **Stale-map deltas as one-line pointers.** Dated assessments and plan files
   are never edited to match reality; a receipt line says what disagreed and
   where to verify.
5. **Gate outcomes with reason.** stopped / executed / awaiting owner — and
   why, especially no-op outcomes ("all remaining work is owner-shaped"), so
   the next loop neither rediscovers the stop nor invents work around it.
6. **Capped.** Roughly 6–12 lines per receipt. If it wants more, the detail
   belongs in a decision packet, PR description, or project-local record.

## Receipts

- **2026-07-04 — Receipt 0** (loop creation).
  - Start: local `main` synced with origin at the PR #54 merge; loop artifacts
    authored on branch `claude/pec-init-prompt` (PR #55).
  - Owner direction of record (2026-07-04, in-session, Ryan Tufts): "I want the
    new init-prompt to be the current leaner convention, not this older one.
    All projects should have the current development loop structure and
    workflow, and therefore same type of init prompt." — with "Dedicated loops
    per project" selected over pointing at the shared bridge loop.
  - Artifacts created: `projects/chirality-piping/loop/{LOOP_INIT.md
    (byte-identical copy of the generic loop init), this WORKPLAN, this
    ledger}`; `projects/chirality-piping/init/init-prompt.md` rewritten to the
    lean launcher pointing here.
  - Deltas (live tree wins): the legacy entry
    `execution/_Coordination/NEXT_INSTANCE_PROMPT.md` remains in place as a
    dated historical map — status claims inside it are not refreshed by this
    loop's creation.
  - Gate outcome: structure-only tranche; no piping deliverable work selected,
    no lifecycle transition, no register change. First working iteration starts
    at the next launch's Step 0.
  - Parked lanes: owner rulings on the piping register's open rows (re-derive
    from `execution/_Coordination/_DECISIONS/_REGISTER.md` at Step 0).

- **2026-07-05 — Receipt 1** (post-DEL-10-05 merge and E2 draft slice).
  - Start: `REPO_ROOT=/Users/ryan/.codex/worktrees/04f4/chirality`; PR #67
    merged at `433a50edcca2daff13734b0d8e5ce62cd11f492f`; work continued on
    `codex/piping-post-del-10-05-next` from `origin/main`.
  - Owner directions of record (2026-07-05, in-session, Ryan Tufts): "I
    approve the PR #62 so merge it and do what is necessary on account of
    that.  Then proceed towards final DEL-10-05 implementation."; "I approve
    merging the PR and proceeding as necessary from there."
  - Selection: Phase E/E1 was satisfied by merged `DEC-065` / TP-RUNNER-015;
    next lawful tranche was E2 `DEL-09-04` draft validation-manual
    reproduction slice, using the E1 runner evidence.
  - Artifacts: commit `8c57cf5f467157d9d2a47654ec68e34cda2c1743`;
    `docs/validation_manual/headless_runner_reproduction.md`;
    `validation/witness/inputs/`; DEL-09-04 run record
    `WORKING_ITEMS_RUN_2026-07-05_TP-VALIDMANUAL-RUNNERREPRO-001.md`.
  - Checks: focused generator/runner/schema checks pass; self-check exit 0;
    harness pytest pass; DEC-025 five-surface sweep pass with summary
    `validation/evidence/sweeps/SWEEP_20260705T050428Z_8c57cf5f4671.json`.
  - Gate outcome: executed within R5/E2 draft-evidence fence; no DEL-09-04
    lifecycle transition; remaining E2 public benchmark thresholds, clean-env
    demonstration, and R5-exit decisions remain parked/human-gated.

- **2026-07-09 — Receipt 2** (orientation + physical-model evaluation, owner-steered).
  - Start: `origin/main` at the PR #135 merge (`18334da97`); piping tree
    unchanged since Receipt 1; work on `codex/piping-physical-model-eval`.
  - Owner steer of record (2026-07-09, launcher `Steer` line, Ryan Tufts):
    "Report back on the current state of development and what, if anything,
    is currently planned.  Then provide a focused evaluation of the physical
    model, both in terms of using the appropriate methods and also
    comprehensive coverage of the domain being modelled.  You can use
    research subagents if warranted."
  - Step 0: no register rulings newer than `DEC-065`; open gates `D-12`,
    `D-07b` AWAITING_RULING, `D-06b` NOT_PREPARED; status summary run
    (ISSUED=1, CHECKING=8, IN_PROGRESS=92); self-check exit 0.
  - Artifact: `plans/ASSESSMENT_2026-07-09_physical_model_evaluation.md`
    (dated map; candidate follow-ups CAND-1..5 in its final section).
  - Gate outcome: reporting tranche only — no lifecycle transition, no
    register change, no deliverable code work; CAND-1..5 parked for owner
    ruling/adoption.

- **2026-07-09 — Receipt 3** (physical-model program adoption, same session as Receipt 2).
  - Owner directions of record (2026-07-09, in-session, Ryan Tufts): "I want
    to introduce flexibility factors and bend flexibility together and now
    properly solve those elements.  I approve CAND-2 and want to include the
    flexibility factors rather than disclosing that there are none.  I agree
    with your other candidates.  More importantly I want to fold this into
    the loop instruction documentation - in whatever the most appropriate
    form is for that.  What's your proposal?" — then, over the proposed
    five-part shape: "this shape is approved.  Proceed accordingly."
  - Artifacts: `plans/PLAN_2026-07-09_physical_model_mechanics.md`; register
    rows `D-34`–`D-37` + packet `D-34_bend_flexibility_stiffness_realization.md`
    + ruling records `D-35/36/37_RULING_2026-07-09.md`; codifications
    `DEC-066`–`DEC-069` in `SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` §12; WORKPLAN owner-intent
    addendum + tactical pointer-index line (this directory).
  - Deltas: assessment CAND-1 superseded by implementation (dated map not
    edited, per rule 4).
  - Checks: self-check exit 0; harness pytest pass.
  - Gate outcome: governance/docs tranche executed at owner direction;
    `D-34` method fork AWAITING_RULING (O-A recommended) — P1 implementation
    starts on that ruling; no lifecycle transition, no code change.

- **2026-07-10 — Receipt 4** (D-34 ruling, same session).
  - Owner ruling of record (2026-07-10, in-session, Ryan Tufts): the D-34
    packet options were presented in-session with O-A recommended; owner
    selected **"O-B: curved-bend macro-element"** via structured selection.
  - Artifacts: packet §7 disposition filled
    (`D-34_bend_flexibility_stiffness_realization.md`); register row `D-34`
    → RULED; codification `DEC-070` in `SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` §12.
  - Checks: self-check exit 0; harness pytest pass (this branch).
  - Gate outcome: ruling recorded; P1 (curved-bend macro-element) is now
    lawful bounded-tranche work under the mechanics plan once PR #141
    merges — O-B noted as the larger tranche, splittable formulation →
    assembly → recovery → benchmark; no code change under this receipt.

- **2026-07-10 — Receipt 5** (P1 execution, owner-directed fable-subagent orchestration).
  - Owner direction of record (2026-07-10, in-session, Ryan Tufts): "Proceed
    accordingly. Execute the work using fable subagents.  Orchestrate and
    evaluate their work. Work in parallel where agents would have disjoint
    write scopes." Also: "merge PR #141" (executed; merged with PR #136 at
    `0f4d95944`).
  - Executed: P1 sub-tranches 1–3 on `codex/piping-p1-curved-bend` —
    run records `WORKING_ITEMS_RUN_2026-07-10_TP-PMM-P1-CURVEDBEND-001.md`
    and `..._TP-PMM-P1-CURVEDBEND-002.md` (DEL-04-01); witness
    `MECH-EXPANSION-LOOP-CURVED-BEND-THERMAL`; benchmark agreement 5.8e-8;
    k-sweep monotonicity asserted.
  - Checks: crate/product/python suites pass (56/27/369); self-check exit 0;
    DEC-025 sweeps `SWEEP_20260710T134128Z_16ba9db23114.json` (clean) and
    `SWEEP_20260710T151446Z_b77e721b2028-dirty.json` (all five surfaces
    pass; sole dirty path is external concurrent-loop state in
    `domains/piping-design/_Sources/**` — untouched per the external-state
    rule).
  - Gate outcome: executed within the DEC-070 fence; PR awaiting owner
    merge; no lifecycle transition. Named residuals: nonlinear-loop
    explicit-stiffness slot (blocking diagnostic in place), arc interior
    stations, consistent arc distributed loads, GUI emission of
    `bend_pipe_ref`.

- **2026-07-10 — Receipt 6** (P2/P3/P4 execution, owner-steered subagent fan-out).
  - Start: `main` at the PR #142 merge (`4ef14f686`); steer of record (launcher, Ryan
    Tufts): "Fan out and fan in with subagents where warranted.  Use the subagent model
    selection protocols in the LOOP instructions."
  - Owner directions of record (2026-07-10, in-session, Ryan Tufts): "proceed with
    merging both PRs" (PR #143, PR #144 — merged at `73b65246f` / `35abf5596`); "resume"
    (P2 agent continuation after transient API terminations).
  - Executed: P4 → PR #143 (TP-PMM-P4-ABSENTDOMAINS-001; DEC-069 naming mirrored onto
    the v0.2 forward-authority surface, flagged for owner review, merged); P3 → PR #144
    (TP-PMM-P3-MILLTOL/OCCLOADGEN/MODULUSBASIS-001, merged); P2 + P1 residual →
    PR #145 (TP-PMM-P1-CURVEDBEND-003, TP-PMM-P2-COMPLEMENTARITY-001,
    TP-PMM-P2-FRICTION-001) awaiting owner merge.
  - New gate: register row `D-38` (temperature interpolation policy) AWAITING_RULING —
    exact selection shipped as conservative floor.
  - Checks: all suites pass per run records; self-check exit 0; harness pytest pass;
    DEC-025 sweeps `SWEEP_20260710T201841Z_c6430cbd5c9b.json` and
    `SWEEP_20260710T214950Z_37b327cf0687.json` (both clean).
  - Gate outcome: executed within DEC-067/068/069/070 fences; no lifecycle transition;
    parked owner gates D-12, D-07b (AWAITING_RULING), D-06b (NOT_PREPARED), D-38.
    Named residuals: sliding prior-iterate direction / nonconvergence corner (run
    records), arc interior stations, temperature-indexed shear modulus, sub-span wind
    marking, GUI emission of new schema slots.

- **2026-07-10 — Receipt 7** (adopted-ruling execution: DEC-061 E3 + DEC-060 coverage tranche).
  - Start: `main` at the PR #146 merge (`199c6d545`); PR #145 merged since Receipt 6;
    steer: none (autonomous run). Step 0: no rulings newer than Receipt 6; census
    ISSUED=1/CHECKING=8/IN_PROGRESS=92; self-check exit 0; harness pytest pass.
  - Executed (parallel fable subagents, disjoint scopes, adopted-but-unexecuted
    rulings per WORKPLAN §5): DEC-061/E3 → `TP-E3-PDFEMIT-001`, PR #148
    (`core/reporting/pdf_emitter`, run record in DEL-08-01); DEC-060 first coverage
    tranche → `TP-E8-COVTELEM-001`, PR #147 (all three lanes measured, first
    clean-head artifact `COVERAGE_20260710T232606Z_e9cd806811b3.json`, no floors;
    run record in DEL-09-05). Both PRs awaiting owner merge; both touch
    `plans/PLAN_COMPLETION_LOG.md` — second merge needs a trivial rebase.
  - Checks: per run records — crate/python/desktop suites pass; self-check exit 0;
    DEC-025 clean-head sweeps `SWEEP_20260710T234618Z_dc63c4a83eed.json` and
    `SWEEP_20260710T233804Z_1094b0deb266.json` pass.
  - Deltas (live tree wins): D-10b packet's "assembled section model" was private and
    HTML-shaped — made public emission-neutral with byte-identity verified; package
    assembly lives in `pdf_emitter`, not `report_generator` (dependency cycle) — both
    in the TP-E3 run record. Completion-plan E4 row understates the live tree
    (`core/security/redaction` + schema + docs exist, tests pass).
  - Gate outcome: executed within the DEC-060/DEC-061 fences; no lifecycle transition,
    no register change; parked gates D-12, D-07b, D-38 (AWAITING_RULING), D-06b
    (NOT_PREPARED, R5-exit lead-up). E3/E8 remainders kept in their plan rows.

- **2026-07-10 — Receipt 8** (receipt-rule clarification, owner-directed; same session
  as Receipt 7).
  - Context: PRs #147/#148/#149 merged at owner direction (`a331c8a83`/`4b3ac073d`/
    `ea627df63`; the merges themselves are git history, not receipt content — this
    entry exists only for the protocol change below).
  - Owner direction of record (2026-07-10, in-session, Ryan Tufts): 'Make this clear
    in your instructions: "merge direction itself needs no receipt addendum — the
    merges are re-derivable from git history, which per the ledger rules is where
    work history lives."'
  - Artifacts: rule 2 exception added to this ledger's Rules; WORKPLAN protocol
    step 3 aligned (this directory).
  - Gate outcome: governance/docs edit executed at owner direction; no code, no
    lifecycle transition, no register change.

- **2026-07-10 — Receipt 9** (loop-instruction consolidation, owner-adopted;
  deliverables become the work-discovery surface).
  - Owner directions of record (2026-07-10, in-session, Ryan Tufts): "I really want
    the deliverables themselves to be the means of discovering work going forward,
    with the loop mechanics included as the development loop instructions. ... We
    need to simplify these instructions and avoid creating unnecessary registers or
    plans."; on the presented consolidation proposal: "Adopted.  Use fable subagents
    where warranted."
  - Artifacts (commit `aceac0b6c288`): `WORKPLAN_2026-07-10_piping_loop.md`
    (supersedes the 2026-07-04 plan; adds fence F-PIP-5); `_COORDINATION.md`
    rewritten as a ruled-record stub (stage record, DEC-040 augmentation, H4
    posture preserved verbatim); `## Remaining` sections in 24 deliverable
    `_STATUS.md` files (51 open items rehomed from plans; rehoming record incl.
    deliberately-not-rehomed F3 / FR-024 / Phase-I-generator items:
    `plans/PLAN_COMPLETION_LOG.md` 2026-07-10 entry); plan retirement banners;
    `NEXT_INSTANCE_PROMPT.md` historical banner; `list_deliverable_status.py`
    `RemainingItems` column + tests; `LOOP_INIT.md` §7 synced to the 2026-07-05
    owner revision; README/docs entry pointers aligned. PR from branch
    `claude/chirality-piping-loop-init-57a151`, awaiting owner merge.
  - Checks: self-check exit 0; harness pytest pass; coordination tests pass;
    deliverable-status summary run (Remaining items: 51 across 24 deliverables);
    DEC-025 clean-head sweep `SWEEP_20260711T031732Z_aceac0b6c288.json` pass.
  - Gate outcome: coordination/control consolidation executed at owner adoption;
    no lifecycle transition, no register change; parked gates unchanged: D-12,
    D-07b, D-38 (AWAITING_RULING), D-06b (NOT_PREPARED).
