# MECH-PORTAL-SWAY-ORIGINAL

| Item | Record |

| Suite | Mechanics benchmark suite (`DEL-09-01`), crate `validation/benchmarks/mechanics/` |
| Evidence class | Mechanics verification |

| Provenance | Invented public-original fixture data only (recorded in the reference note and fixture metadata) |

## Test Purpose And Problem Statement

Portal-frame benchmark for deterministic multi-element assembly and reduced
system solution.

All inputs are invented or user-entered fixture data; nothing is copied from
protected standards, commercial software examples, or proprietary data.

## Input Model

The machine-readable input model is the fixture constructor `portal_frame_sway_fixture()` (fixture id `MECH-PORTAL-SWAY-ORIGINAL`) in `validation/benchmarks/mechanics/src/lib.rs`, carrying explicit fixture-local units and public-original provenance metadata. The reference note records the same invented inputs with the longhand derivation.

## Expected Result And Independent Reference

The expected values and their derivation are recorded in the independent
reference note `validation/hand_calcs/mechanics/portal_frame_sway.md` and mirrored in the fixture's expected-value
slots. The reference derivation uses elementary open mechanics only.

## Software Result And Reproduction

The measured-vs-reference comparison executes inside the named suite
test(s) `portal_frame_fixture_solves_repeatably`, which run the current in-repo solver path on the fixture
and assert agreement with the reference expectations.

Reproduction (from `projects/chirality-piping`):

```bash
cargo test --manifest-path validation/benchmarks/mechanics/Cargo.toml portal_frame_fixture_solves_repeatably
```

Recorded run: 2026-07-10, toolchain rustc 1.92.0 / cargo 1.92.0; suite
result `ok. 30 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored` with the named test(s) passing. The full
suite output and the exact commit are recorded in the run record
`execution/PKG-09_Verification, Validation, and Quality Oracles/1_Working/DEL-09-04_Validation manual skeleton/_run_records/WORKING_ITEMS_RUN_2026-07-10_TP-E2-VALMANUAL-001.md`.

Headless-runner status: PR #287 bound `run-benchmark` and `run-regression`
for the committed `DEL-10-05` benchmark/regression payload families. That
bounded evidence does not establish a runner payload or per-case runner
execution for this page, so the exact reproduction command here remains the
crate test above. `export-results` is the only structured runner verb that
remains a stub. The bound runner path and its exact witnessed cases are recorded
in
[headless_runner_reproduction.md](../../headless_runner_reproduction.md).

## Tolerance

Numeric agreement assertions in this suite use the fixture-local absolute assertion epsilon `INTERNAL_ASSERTION_EPSILON = 1.0e-9` recorded in `validation/benchmarks/mechanics/src/lib.rs`; structural and deterministic expectations (prepared boundaries, diagnostics, routing, provenance) are asserted exactly. This matches the `DEC-026` analytic-class relative seed magnitude but the fixture's `tolerance_policy` slots remain unresolved: the governed per-quantity-kind tolerance record required by `DEC-024`/`DEC-026` remains `TBD`, and this page neither tightens nor loosens any governed value.

## Pass/Fail

`PASS` at the recorded run above: every named test asserted the measured-vs-reference expectations and completed with `ok`. This is software-quality evidence only.

## Solver Version

The in-repo OpenPipeStress solver and benchmark crates at the commit recorded
in `execution/PKG-09_Verification, Validation, and Quality Oracles/1_Working/DEL-09-04_Validation manual skeleton/_run_records/WORKING_ITEMS_RUN_2026-07-10_TP-E2-VALMANUAL-001.md`; toolchain rustc 1.92.0 / cargo 1.92.0. No packaged release version
exists; release labels remain `TBD`.

## Boundary

This case page documents software verification evidence for an invented
public-original fixture. It is development verification and screening
evidence (claims registry BS-VALID, DEC-081), and it does not settle any
`TBD` threshold or governed tolerance decision.
