 * fetches land in the dead-socket window, latch a terminal error, and stay wrong
 * forever — the top bar flips to "connected" while the persona roster still says
 * unavailable. The main process already publishes the transition; the missing
 * half was a renderer-side signal that says "re-ask, once".
 *
 * One counter rather than a refresh bus or per-pane listeners: it composes with
 * React's own re-run rule, so a pane opts in by adding one dependency, and there
 * is no subscription for a pane to forget to unsubscribe from. Re-fetching is
 * strictly one pass per transition — the main process owns retry and backoff, so
 * a renderer that also retried would be a second, uncoordinated retry loop.
