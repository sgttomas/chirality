 *
 * Returns `null` whenever there is nothing observable: during SSR, in a plain
 * browser, or on an older desktop build whose preload predates the connectivity
 * bridge. Callers render no indicator in that case.
 *
 * Deliberately push-driven. The daemon-status IPC already existed but only ran
 * when a renderer asked, which is why a daemon that came back after startup was
 * never noticed. Here the main process owns the polling and this hook only
 * mirrors its state, so one supervisor serves every mounted shell.
