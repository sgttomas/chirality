## Package Scope

**ScopeDescription:** App/project permission policy, explicit hard-deny inputs, human approvals, project-specific deterministic tools/hooks, client presentation, and daemon conformance.

**InclusionCriteria:** Project authority and policy inputs; App approval UI; project-specific tool acts; affected-client evidence.

**Exclusions:** Generic runtime tool mediation/execution, interruption, operational event persistence, and domain-engine operation semantics.

## Deliverable Scope

Keep Bash denied by App/project policy by default, require explicit human authorization, and verify daemon timeout, capture, output, interruption, and operational audit behavior before use.

## Anticipated Artifacts

App Bash policy/human-gate tests; daemon timeout/capture/interruption conformance; output evidence fixtures

## Source Authority

This folder was scaffolded by ORCHESTRATOR from the accepted v3.2 SOFTWARE_DECOMP working surface. Downstream TASK work must preserve `ResponsibleParty: TBD` until a human assigns ownership.

## SCA-APP-001 Context Alignment

`SCA-APP-001` is accepted. This deliverable is aligned to the provider-adapter-general runtime strategy: Claude Agent SDK / Anthropic remains the first concrete/current path; Pi is pattern corpus/reference only; permission governance is capability-forward with explicit hard-deny precedence.

Primary impact: Bash remains unavailable until governed and validated; this must not suppress unrelated useful tool capabilities.

Package-local review status: `SCA-APP-001-CLOSURE-002` refreshed the base context fields and reviewed or updated targeted local kit wording in `Guidance.md`, `Specification.md`, `Procedure.md`, `Datasheet.md`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, and `Dependencies.csv` against the accepted SCA. Remaining `TBD` values and non-SCA dependency lifecycle states retain their prior status.

This package-local refresh does not change runtime source, package manifests, lockfiles, desktop wrapper files, provider implementation, Pi implementation, or release-readiness posture.
