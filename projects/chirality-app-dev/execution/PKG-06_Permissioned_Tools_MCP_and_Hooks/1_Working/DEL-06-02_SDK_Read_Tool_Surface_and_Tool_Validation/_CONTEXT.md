## Package Scope

**ScopeDescription:** Deny-first permission overlay, tool exposure, MCP wrappers, hooks, writes, bash, compaction hooks.

**InclusionCriteria:** Runtime tool execution governance.

**Exclusions:** Domain-engine operation semantics except protected-path hooks.

## Deliverable Scope

Resolve `opts.tools` to registered SDK built-ins or Chirality MCP names, reject unknowns, and expose read tools before writes/bash.

## Anticipated Artifacts

Tool resolver; unknown-tool tests; deterministic ordering fixtures

## Source Authority

This folder was scaffolded by ORCHESTRATOR from the accepted v3.2 SOFTWARE_DECOMP working surface. Downstream TASK work must preserve `ResponsibleParty: TBD` until a human assigns ownership.
## SCA-APP-001 Context Alignment

`SCA-APP-001` is accepted. This deliverable is aligned to the provider-adapter-general runtime strategy: Claude Agent SDK / Anthropic remains the first concrete/current path; Pi is pattern corpus/reference only; permission governance is capability-forward with explicit hard-deny precedence.

Primary impact: Read tool exposure remains early capability work under policy and evidence, not suppressive default denial.

Local `Guidance.md`, `Specification.md`, `Procedure.md`, `Datasheet.md`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, and `_REFERENCES.md` remain `STALE_LOCAL_REVIEW_REQUIRED` where they encode prior Anthropic-only, Pi-spike, or blanket deny-first assumptions. Do not treat those local artifacts as refreshed until a bounded package-local review updates or confirms them.
