- **DEL-09-01-V3-01** (`SELECTABLE`; condition met by PR #686 / e59efa483 / Receipt-212) — Section 8 preservation and Shared Runtime Gate evidence across the v3 program.
  Trace: OUT-001, AC-001, VER-001; DEL-09-01-REQ-004/006/008; applied decomposition row L364 (preserve baseline harness validation, current local checks, and stable premerge summary behavior).
  Plan: WP-10; AT-037 native-engine regression on preparation bytes (G5); RQG §13 Shared Runtime Gate evidence contribution. Completion meaning from `plans/chirality_app_v3_release_execution_plan_final_2026-08-22.html` (SHA-256 `b0a57a917643fbc850b033c043c91a480ea198af84eed213235f5893f257ab5a`, completion reference only); status from current `main`.
  Depends: A merged v3 product change on a sibling carrier; DEP-09-01-005/008/010.
  Write locus: `frontend/scripts/validate-harness-*.mjs`, Section 8 fixtures, `frontend/artifacts/harness/section8/**` evidence, and deliverable-local state.
  Checks: registered frontend gates (typecheck, Vitest, `npm run validate:release-quality` build/premerge, D-APP-36 render bar for UI), APP-HOLD-1 dispatch preflight, `git diff --check`, repo-wide harness self-check and pytest, and the independent-review path (fresh read-only `TASK + software-code-review` PASS over 100% of the frozen diff before push); Step 0 must carry the A1 re-stage declaration because `frontend/` is touched.
  Return: Stable premerge summary bytes proving unchanged Section 8 behavior after each v3 landing, with the RQG §13 mapping rows this deliverable owns; durable non-secret bytes sufficient for independent recomputation per the successor workplan's Evidence contract: exact input/source identities and cited-byte inventory; fixture/evaluator/validator bytes; command, arguments, cwd, effective environment, tool/runtime versions, and exit status; canonical stdout/stderr and machine-readable results; sorted manifests with recomputable hashes; cleanup proof for disposable state; and a bounded rerun method.
  Removed when: Revised after each v3 landing; removed at G5 fan-in when preservation evidence is accepted.

## History
- 2026-09-03 - v3.0.0-rc.1 pathway seating (A12; App counterpart of Root R17): `ScopeOfWork.md` re-pinned to the applied decomposition at `d6f6cadb2be0c6e2e9c5ba331a553a54c60a8a0f`; v3 Remaining items seeded (1, of which 0 SELECTABLE) with dependency, gate, write-locus, check, and return contracts; run evidence `execution/_Coordination/AgentRuns/APP_V3_PATHWAY_SEATING_2026-09-03/`. No implementation, lifecycle, dependency-acceptance, release, or Root act; Current State, Checking Approval SHA, and lifecycle are unchanged.
- 2026-07-12 - D-APP-56 final code tranche implemented UPD-140/UPD-141 deterministic wrapper failure fixtures; state remains IN_PROGRESS.
- 2026-05-20 - State set to INITIALIZED (TASK+four-documents)
- 2026-05-20 - State set to OPEN (PREPARATION)
- 2026-05-23 - State set to SEMANTIC_READY (ORCHESTRATOR_PHASE_2_5_CLOSEOUT)
- 2026-06-16 - State set to IN_PROGRESS (HUMAN) [Human authority: active code implementation underway.]
- 2026-06-20 - State set to CHECKING (HUMAN)
- 2026-07-11 - State set to IN_PROGRESS (HUMAN) [Owner-ruled lifecycle rebaseline D-APP-54 2026-07-11: administrative correction superseding the D-APP-19 inspection-admission convention; prior approvals and history preserved (execution/_Coordination/_DECISIONS/D-APP-54_RULING_2026-07-11.md).]
- 2026-07-11 - Remaining item added: concordance bootstrap seeded at packet time per D-APP-55 packet; no state change.
- 2026-07-11 - Remaining item updated: concordance bootstrap gate flipped and pinned method revision 551f84ef6 substituted per the D-APP-55 ruling (Option A, whole corpus); no state change.
- 2026-07-12 - D-APP-56 R5 P40 applied UPD-075, UPD-078; generic concordance Remaining item retained for R6; state remains IN_PROGRESS.
- 2026-07-12 - D-APP-56 R5 P45 applied UPD-142; generic concordance Remaining item retained for R6; state remains IN_PROGRESS.
- 2026-07-12 - R6 closeout completed the D-APP-55 concordance bootstrap and removed it from Remaining; surviving deliverable-local items retained; state remains IN_PROGRESS.
