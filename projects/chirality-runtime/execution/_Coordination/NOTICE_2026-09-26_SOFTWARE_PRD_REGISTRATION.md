# software-prd workflow registered

Owner-directed Root tranche `ROOT-SOFTWARE-PRD-REGISTRATION-20260926` registers `software-prd` in the bundled catalog at source identity `chirality-root:bundled:workflow:software-prd`. On the owner's decisions of 2026-09-26 it is placed in core navigation, immediately before `software-decomp`; it is not a central workflow and is not added to the Root `AGENTS.md` table. It is the reviewed draft from `plans/proposals/Software_PRD_Workflow_Draft_v1/`, revised to current conventions:
- It forms a PRD for a new software product or a defined development undertaking, with six working steps and two grouped human checkpoints: A (product direction and basis for authoring; existing explicit direction may satisfy it) and B (the independently examined PRD and passage to FEED). It matches chapter 2 of the management manual v7.
- Its `execution.json` limits compatible roles to HELP_HUMAN, HELPS_HUMANS and WORKING_ITEMS. TASK does not select or run it, though bounded contributions may still be assigned to TASK under a brief.
- Default locations, where the brief names none and the project has no convention: `RUN_ROOT = {WORKING_ROOT}/planning/prd/<run-id>/` and `PRD_TARGET = docs/PRD.md`. They resolve paths and grant no writes.
- Checkpoint A is recorded as a note in `PRD_RECORD.md`; no immutable snapshot is required, and one is optional. Only checkpoint B is always snapshotted: an immutable snapshot (`DECISION.md`, `ACCEPTED_MANIFEST.csv`, `HANDOFF_STATE.md`) outside the content it identifies. The handoff names the PRD identity (path, content hash, revision where versioned, and included set), the separate decision record, and the accepted portions with shared constraints, explicit exclusions, and open work. This is what `software-decomp` group 1 records as its accepted basis.
- `reverse-engineer-software` remains the route for a successor PRD formed by examining an existing project. Both workflows cross-reference each other and hand off in the same form. `software-decomp`'s contract Inputs now name `software-prd` alongside `reverse-engineer-software` as a producer of accepted PRDs; this is its only change.
- The index builder's fixed core navigation list and its catalog test include `software-prd`; the central set is unchanged.
- The agent manual v3 formation section and its HTML now describe the registered workflow.

The workflow launches no PRD work, decomposition or implementation by itself. This loop decides whether and when to adopt or select it; this source tranche changes no accepted instruction basis, pin, hold, or permission, and grants no release.

Runtime-specific: Runtime owns the effective catalog and packaging path. Whether and when this method enters the Runtime-accepted catalog is decided by this loop.
