# Scaffold Contract

## Operation map

| Operation | Required accepted input | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Package hierarchy | package ID and name | package lifecycle directories |
| Package references | package identity and available references | files or `_REFERENCE_INDEX.md` |
| Deliverable fileset | deliverable and package fields plus decomposition reference | four metadata files and `deliverable.yaml` |
| Aggregation prerequisites | execution root | `_Aggregation` root and neutral templates |
| Category hierarchy | category ID and name | category lifecycle directories |
| Knowledge-type fileset | knowledge-type and category fields plus decomposition reference | four non-dependency metadata files |
| Domain tool roots | execution root | hypergraph and closure structural roots |

## Tool operations

Resolve commands against the tool root.

- Package or category hierarchy: `tools/scaffolding/scaffold_package.sh <EXECUTION_ROOT> <ID> <Label>`.
- Identifier check: `tools/validation/validate_id_format.sh <PKG|DEL|CAT|KTY> <ID>`.
- Deliverable or knowledge-type folder: `tools/scaffolding/scaffold_deliverable.sh <package-or-category>/1_Working <ID> <Label>`. It creates `{ID}_{Label}` under the parent's `1_Working/` with four empty metadata stubs; a DEL locality also receives a valid `deliverable.yaml`. Add `--memory` as the fourth argument only when `MEMORY.md` is selected and authorized; the tool refuses when a legacy `_MEMORY.md` exists, so report that instead of working around it.
- Aggregation prerequisites: `tools/scaffolding/scaffold_tool_root.sh {EXECUTION_ROOT} _Aggregation`, then create any missing `_Aggregation/_Templates/AGGREGATION_BRIEF_TEMPLATE.md` (neutral headings only) and `_Aggregation/_Templates/TARGET_SCHEMA_TEMPLATE.csv` (header row only).
- Domain tool roots: `tools/scaffolding/scaffold_tool_root.sh {EXECUTION_ROOT}/_Aggregation Hypergraph` and `tools/scaffolding/scaffold_tool_root.sh {EXECUTION_ROOT}/_Evaluation HypergraphClosure`.

Package and category lifecycle hierarchies contain `0_References/`, `0_References/_Archive/`, `1_Working/`, `1_Working/_Archive/`, `2_Checking/`, `2_Checking/From/`, `2_Checking/To/`, `3_Issued/`, and `3_Issued/_Archive/`.

## Context files

A deliverable `_CONTEXT.md` records its ID and canonical name, package ID and canonical name, discipline, type, responsible party, exact accepted description, anticipated artifacts, decomposition path, and deliverable ID.

A knowledge-type `_CONTEXT.md` records its ID and canonical name, category ID and canonical name, discipline, type, responsible party, exact accepted description, anticipated artifacts, decomposition path, knowledge-type ID, and category ID.

Do not normalize or embellish accepted field values. Use `TBD` only when the accepted source itself is unresolved, and report that condition.

## Consumer-local needs (PROJECT/SOFTWARE DEL only)

Create `deliverable.yaml` once, without overwriting an existing file:

```yaml
id: DEL-12-03
needs: []
```

Use the accepted numeric DEL identity. A descriptive directory/decomposition
suffix is a label binding, not part of the native YAML ID; preserve that
accepted binding and numbering. Check the YAML ID against its owning folder
and the accepted decomposition ID with
`check_min_viable_fileset.sh <folder> <accepted-deliverable-ID>`.

An empty list means no needs have been declared yet. It establishes no claim
that the input set is complete, satisfied or suitable for execution. The
consumer's responsible contributor later authors actual inputs, conditions,
use and unresolved sources in this file through `dependency-extract`, using
the schema in `tools/deliverables/cli.py`. Reverse links and graphs are queried
when needed. Do not create dependency CSV/Markdown companions, migrate existing
artifacts automatically, or copy derived reverse links into another declaration.

This DEL-native method does not assess KTY dependency declarations. A KTY
scaffold creates only its four non-dependency metadata files, leaving any
existing dependency artifacts untouched; it does not fabricate a KTY needs
schema.

## Remaining control files

- `_STATUS.md`: when the file is newly created, including an empty stub from
  the scaffolder, write exactly this form, naming the actual actor:

  ```markdown
  # Status: <ID> <Name>

  **Current State:** OPEN
  **Last Updated:** <YYYY-MM-DD>

  ## History
  - <YYYY-MM-DD> — State set to OPEN (<actor>)
  ```

  `tools/scaffolding/write_status.sh` parses the `**Current State:**` line for
  later transitions and cannot initialize an empty stub.
- `_REFERENCES.md`: list supplied reference names or IDs, locations, and relevance; otherwise state that references are not yet identified.
- `_SEMANTIC.md`: create a `PLACEHOLDER` lens with no engineering assertions. A later semantic workflow may replace it.
- `MEMORY.md`: optional and outside the minimum fileset. Create it only when explicitly selected and authorized, filling it from `docs/templates/MEMORY_TEMPLATE.md` (the terse `## Runs` index). Do not create a future-work list.

Aggregation templates, when requested, are structural only. The target-schema CSV begins with `RecordID,SourceID,SourcePath,SectionRef,EntityType,Key,Value,Notes,Confidence,Tags` and no data rows.
