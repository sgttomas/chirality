# audit-decomp — contract

## Mission

Parse the decomposition document (Ledger, Objectives, Partitions, and Production Units sections — resolved via Variant Section Binding) and compare its declarations against the actual filesystem state under `{EXECUTION_ROOT}`. Produce:

- a coverage report with PASS/WARNING/BLOCKER outcomes for 12 core checks (including package-shape conformance),
- a per-deliverable coverage matrix,
- machine-readable metrics (JSON),
- an actionable issue log.

---

## Non-negotiable invariants

- **Read-only everywhere.** Never modify any deliverable file, `_CONTEXT.md`, `_STATUS.md`, `Dependencies.csv`, or the decomposition document.
- **Evidence-first.** Every finding must trace to a specific decomposition section/row AND a specific filesystem path (or absence thereof).
- **No invention.** If data is ambiguous or missing, mark as `UNKNOWN` / `INCOMPLETE` and continue. Do not infer intent.
- **Deterministic.** Deterministic inventories and explicit semantic judgments.
- **Immutable snapshots.** Each run writes a new snapshot folder; never overwrite prior snapshots.
- **Pointer moves belong to the manager.** The TASK never moves `_LATEST.md`. After the run returns 0 BLOCKERs, the invoking manager may overwrite `_LATEST.md` as a pointer when its brief authorizes that move; snapshots remain immutable.
- **Audit snapshot is derivative evidence.** The audit snapshot is evidence for closure and handoff-state, not decomposition truth. It must identify the authoritative inputs it evaluated.
- **Package-aware for `DOMAIN`.** When `DECOMP_VARIANT = DOMAIN`, the audit must treat active decomposition-local derivatives and active `_ScopeChange` artifacts as auditable package state, not background residue.

## Inputs (brief schema)

Required:
- `EXECUTION_ROOT`: path to the execution instance (e.g., `test/execution-*`)
- `DECOMPOSITION_PATH`: path to the decomposition document (e.g., `{EXECUTION_ROOT}/_Decomposition/file_name.md`)
- `SCOPE`: `ALL` (default) | list of package IDs | list of deliverable IDs
- `DECOMP_VARIANT`: `PROJECT` | `SOFTWARE` | `DOMAIN` — identifies which decomposition agent produced the document. Determines section binding, folder patterns, entity names, and ID formats (see variant binding tables below).

Optional:
- `RUN_LABEL`: short label for this run (default `DECOMP_COV`)
- `REQUESTED_BY`: invoking agent name (default `WORKING_ITEMS`)
- `PRIOR_RUN_LABEL`: optional label for comparison mode (load prior JSON and compute deltas)
- `EXPECTED_SOURCE_SNAPSHOT`: optional accepted upstream snapshot path that this audit run is expected to evaluate and cite in outputs
- `EXPECTED_HANDOFF_PHASE`: optional phase or handoff label so the run can state which closure boundary it supports
- `ACCEPTED_DECISIONS`: optional list of accepted decision or scope-change references (for example SCA snapshots, D-records, retirement rulings) that the run may cite when classifying a finding as `EXPECTED_CONSEQUENCE`

### Finding classification

Each finding carries a `Severity` of `BLOCKER`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, or
`EXPECTED_CONSEQUENCE`. `EXPECTED_CONSEQUENCE` marks a condition that would
otherwise be a BLOCKER or WARNING but is the stated, expected result of an
accepted decision (for example a retired or superseded production unit, a
reallocated ledger row, or deferred production recorded by an accepted scope
change). It requires a `DecisionRef` citing that accepted decision; without a
citable accepted decision the finding keeps its ordinary severity. Expected
consequences are reported and counted separately and do not count toward
closure blockers, `overall_status`, or `closure_readiness`.

### Retired production units

A production unit is retired when its `_STATUS.md` Current State is `RETIRED`
or an accepted decomposition row or scope-change record retires it.

- It remains in the census and the coverage matrix with `LifecycleState=RETIRED`.
- Identity checks (Checks 2–5) still apply. An absent or archived folder, or a
  missing decomposition row, that an accepted decision explains is
  `EXPECTED_CONSEQUENCE`; otherwise the ordinary severity applies.
- Check 6 does not require anticipated artifacts for a retired unit.
- Check 7 does not count a retired unit as active objective support.
- Check 8 treats an `IN` ledger row mapped only to retired units as a WARNING
  unless an accepted decision reallocates or retires that row
  (`EXPECTED_CONSEQUENCE`).
- Check 11 tallies `RETIRED` as a recognized state.

### Variant Entity Binding

This protocol uses **Package / Deliverable / Scope Ledger / Scope Item** terminology throughout. When `DECOMP_VARIANT` is not `PROJECT`, substitute terms per this table:

| Protocol term | WORKING_ITEMS (workflow: project-decomp) | WORKING_ITEMS (workflow: software-decomp) | WORKING_ITEMS (workflow: domain-decomp) |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Package | Package | Package | Category |
| Deliverable | Deliverable | Deliverable | Knowledge Type |
| Scope Item | Scope Item | Scope Item | Handbook Unit |
| Scope Ledger | Scope Ledger | Scope Ledger | Domain Ledger |
| Artifact | Artifact | Artifact | Knowledge Subject |

### Variant Section Binding

Section numbering differs between decomposition variant outputs. All protocol steps reference sections by **semantic name**. Resolve to the correct location as follows.

Bind by heading text, never by section number. Section numbers differ between
variants, differ between documents of the same variant, and drift as documents
are amended.

To resolve a semantic section, collect the document's `##` headings and
normalize each one: strip the `## ` marker, strip a leading section number of
the form `N.` or `NA.` (digits, optional letter suffix, period, trailing
space — e.g. `10A.`), trim, and case-fold. Normalize the target text the same
way. Then match in rank order, stopping at the first rank that yields a hit:
exact, then prefix, then substring. If a rank yields more than one hit, take
the earliest heading in the document and report the ambiguity. Only when no
rank yields any hit is the binding unresolved: stop and report it. Never
resolve by position.

| Semantic section | WORKING_ITEMS (workflow: project-decomp) heading | WORKING_ITEMS (workflow: software-decomp) heading | WORKING_ITEMS (workflow: domain-decomp) heading |
|------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Ledger | `Scope Ledger` | `Scope Ledger` | `Domain Ledger` |
| Objectives | `Objectives` | `Objectives`, or the `ObjectiveID(s)` column of `Scope Ledger` where the variant embeds mapping in the ledger | `Objectives` |
| Partitions (Packages / Categories) | `Packages` | `Packages` | `Categories` |
| Production Units (Deliverables / Knowledge Types) | `Deliverables` | `Deliverables` | `Knowledge Types` |

When `DECOMP_VARIANT = SOFTWARE`, Check 7 (Objective Mapping) resolves objectives from the Scope Ledger `ObjectiveID(s)` column rather than a dedicated Objectives section; the ledger column is authoritative for Check 7 even where the document also carries a dedicated `Objectives` heading.

### Variant Folder Patterns

| Pattern | WORKING_ITEMS (workflow: project-decomp) | WORKING_ITEMS (workflow: software-decomp) | WORKING_ITEMS (workflow: domain-decomp) |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Partition folder | `{ROOT}/PKG-{ID}_*/` | `{ROOT}/PKG-{ID}_*/` | `{ROOT}/CAT-{ID}_*/` |
| Production Unit folder | `PKG-{PID}_*/{LIFECYCLE}/DEL-{ID}_*/` | `PKG-{PID}_*/{LIFECYCLE}/DEL-{ID}_*/` | `CAT-{PID}_*/{LIFECYCLE}/KTY-{ID}_*/` |

`{LIFECYCLE}` is `1_Working`, `2_Checking`, or `3_Issued`; a unit found in more than one lifecycle folder is an ID-consistency finding (Check 4).

### Variant ID Formats

| Entity | WORKING_ITEMS (workflow: project-decomp) | WORKING_ITEMS (workflow: software-decomp) | WORKING_ITEMS (workflow: domain-decomp) |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Partition ID | `PKG-XXX` (3-digit) | `PKG-XX` (2-digit) | `CAT-###` |
| Production Unit ID | `DEL-XXX-YY_{desc}` | `DEL-XX-YY` | `KTY-CC-TT_{desc}` |
| ID normalization | Strip `_{desc}` suffix | No suffix; compare directly | Strip `_{desc}` suffix |

### Variant-Specific Behavior

**WORKING_ITEMS (workflow: software-decomp):**
- Step 5 (Context Fidelity): also compare `ContextEnvelope` field
- Step 7 (Objective Mapping): objectives extracted from Scope Ledger `ObjectiveID(s)` column, not a dedicated section

**WORKING_ITEMS (workflow: domain-decomp):**
- Step 5 (Context Fidelity): also compare `CanonicalSchema`, `IntendedUsers`, `WhenUsed` fields
- Step 6 (Artifact Presence): check against the Knowledge Type's anticipated Knowledge Subjects instead of the standard four-doc set
- Step 8 (Ledger Integrity): the ledger is named "Domain Ledger" and uses `UnitID` / `CategoryID` / `KnowledgeTypeID(s)` columns

If `DECOMPOSITION_PATH` is missing, unreadable, or cannot be parsed (Partitions/Production Units sections not found per Variant Section Binding): write `RUN_SUMMARY.md` with `RUN_STATUS = FAILED_INPUTS` and return.

If `EXECUTION_ROOT` is missing or no deliverable folders can be discovered: write `RUN_SUMMARY.md` with `RUN_STATUS = FAILED_INPUTS` and return.

---

## Outputs (write zone)

Bootstrap tool root: `tools/scaffolding/scaffold_tool_root.sh {EXECUTION_ROOT}/_Evaluation DecompCoverage`

Create snapshot folder: `tools/scaffolding/create_snapshot_folder.sh {EXECUTION_ROOT}/_Evaluation/DecompCoverage COV {RUN_LABEL}`

Deterministic inputs (run from the tool root, writing only into the snapshot folder):
- Inventory and lifecycle (Checks 2, 3, 6 format resolution, and 11): `python3 tools/evaluation/audit_structure.py --root {EXECUTION_ROOT} --variant {DECOMP_VARIANT} --output {snapshot_folder}/structure.json [--inventory {snapshot_folder}/inventory.json]`, where `inventory.json` lists the accepted production units from the bound Production Units register.
- DOMAIN package integrity (Checks 9 and 10 when `DECOMP_VARIANT = DOMAIN`): `python3 tools/validation/validate_domain_decomposition_integrity.py --decomposition-root {EXECUTION_ROOT}/_Decomposition --output-report {snapshot_folder}/Domain_Integrity_Report.md --output-findings {snapshot_folder}/Domain_Integrity_Findings.csv [--scope-change-snapshot {ACTIVE_SCA_SNAPSHOT}] [--package-subfolder {name}]`.
Record each tool's command, exit code, and output path in `QA_Report.md`; when a tool is unavailable, mark the dependent checks `INCOMPLETE` with the reason.

Snapshot contents (minimum):
- `Brief.md` (verbatim brief + normalized parameters)
- `RUN_SUMMARY.md` (`RUN_STATUS = OK|WARNINGS|BLOCKERS|FAILED_INPUTS`; for a completed run it equals `coverage_summary.json` `overall_status`)
- `QA_Report.md` (scan coverage + parse issues + limits)
- `Decision_Log.md` (defaults, overrides, assumptions)
- `Decomp_Coverage_Report.md` (human-readable narrative)
- `Decomp_Coverage_IssueLog.csv`
- `Decomp_Coverage_Matrix.csv`
- `coverage_summary.json`
- deterministic tool outputs used by the run (`structure.json`, and for DOMAIN `Domain_Integrity_Report.md` and `Domain_Integrity_Findings.csv`)

Update pointer (manager only, after 0 BLOCKERs and when the manager's brief authorizes it): `tools/scaffolding/update_latest_pointer.sh {EXECUTION_ROOT}/_Evaluation/DecompCoverage {snapshot_folder_name}`

---

## Validity

A run is valid when:
- Outputs are written to a new immutable snapshot folder under `{EXECUTION_ROOT}/_Evaluation/DecompCoverage/`.
- `Decomp_Coverage_Report.md`, `Decomp_Coverage_IssueLog.csv`, `Decomp_Coverage_Matrix.csv`, and `coverage_summary.json` exist.
- The report includes verdicts for all 12 checks (or marks them `SKIPPED` / `INCOMPLETE` with reasons).
- Every BLOCKER/WARNING finding includes evidence pointers (decomposition reference + filesystem path or absence).
- Every `EXPECTED_CONSEQUENCE` finding cites an accepted decision in `DecisionRef`.
- If `EXPECTED_SOURCE_SNAPSHOT` was provided, the report and `coverage_summary.json` cite it explicitly so the audit snapshot can serve as derivative closure evidence.
- When `DECOMP_VARIANT = DOMAIN`, active derivative-package parity, active snapshot completeness, handoff-state consistency, and objective-evidence integrity are explicitly evaluated and surfaced.
- No file outside the write zone is modified.
- The decomposition document is not modified.
- No deliverable file is modified.
