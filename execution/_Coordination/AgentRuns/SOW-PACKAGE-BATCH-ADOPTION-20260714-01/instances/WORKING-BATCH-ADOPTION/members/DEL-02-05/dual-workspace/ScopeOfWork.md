# Scope of Work — DEL-02-05

## Purpose and Objective Traceability

This migration candidate defines `DEL-02-05` in service of project scope [SOW-050, SOW-041] and package objectives [OBJ-001, OBJ-012].

- **OUT-001** — A project-persistence and round-trip serialization contract covering create, open, save, versioned persistence, units, loads, rule-pack references, provenance, and reproducibility metadata is produced for the declared scope and objectives.

##### D-41 R5 T7 PDU-055 current declaration

Current authority is `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` revision 0.8, approved `execution/_DAG/DAG-007/` graph context, and D-41/`DEC-074` through the completed T1-T6 bounded records. The implemented working-tree slice and its evidence supersede this surface's setup-only, future-only, or overtaken TBD wording as a current declaration; that earlier wording remains historical setup context only.

Surviving deliverable-local residuals and gates are those recorded in `_STATUS.md ## Remaining`; dated MEMORY and formal-review history remain unchanged. This refresh does not imply lifecycle, review, validation, release, professional-reliance, or code-compliance closure.

##### PDU-024 Runtime Version Evidence

- Current authored model-document schema: `0.2.0`.
- Governed legacy path: `0.1.0 -> 0.2.0`, reported as `stale` by version check and `migrated` by migration evidence.
- Refusal/diagnostic states: `unsupported_schema`, `newer_than_supported`, and `failed`.
- UI evidence consumers: Project Validation, Export Review, and Report persistence context; all use the shared browser-preview mirror of the DEC-019/DEC-033 evaluator.

##### Construction

The deliverable construction target is a three-artifact kit:

| Artifact | Minimum construction expectation | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Project file schema | Define a versioned project document contract covering project identity, schema version, unit system, model payload, load payloads, rule-pack references, provenance metadata, and validation/migration status. Exact schema file layout is TBD. | `docs/_Registers/Deliverables.csv` row DEL-02-05; `docs/SPEC.md` section 3; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` AB-00-04 |

Exact test harness details are TBD. | `docs/PRD.md` section 10 FR-001; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` AB-00-04 and AB-00-08 |
| Persistence service contract | Define application-service operations for create/open/save/version validation, migration-status reporting, diagnostics/result envelopes, and data-boundary checks. Exact interface language/API shape is TBD. | `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` AB-00-02, AB-00-03, AB-00-06, AB-00-07 |

ASSUMPTION: The persisted project document will be treated as durable project state, while session-only UI state and job-progress state remain outside this deliverable unless later injected by an applicable GUI-state brief.

##### Scope

This specification defines the bounded requirements for DEL-02-05: create/open/save/versioned project persistence and deterministic round-trip serialization for project models, unit metadata, loads, rule-pack references, and provenance metadata.

In scope:

- project file schema contract;
- round-trip serialization and deterministic canonicalization behavior for JSON payloads;
- persistence service contract for create/open/save/version validation and migration-status reporting;
- validation and test obligations for schema, round-trip, hash stability, provenance, unit metadata, and protected-content boundaries.

Out of scope:

- numerical solving, stress recovery, GUI views, report rendering, and rule-pack expression evaluation;
- physical project package/container selection, migration framework/tooling, binary asset packaging, exact dependency versions, public API transport, and exact schema file layout, all of which remain TBD under SCA-001;
- any bundled protected standards content, code-specific formulas, tables, allowables, or proprietary project examples.

### CLM-013 — PDU-024 Version Contract Integration

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Specification.md","line_end":34,"line_start":31,"source_sha256":"6f286962f9f6d2f85f960339c3643e92ff834ab1b0e28c2dc16896cd4ea55a36","target_id":"CLM-013"} -->
##### PDU-024 Version Contract Integration

The accepted runtime authoring family is model-document schema `0.2.0`. UI version checks consume the established DEC-019/DEC-033 migration evaluator: `current` identifies `0.2.0`, `stale` identifies an older document with a governed migration path, and `unsupported_schema`, `newer_than_supported`, or `failed` remain explicit refusal/diagnostic states. Separate migration evidence continues to report `migrated` when the `0.1.0 -> 0.2.0` in-memory path is applied. No new status names or migration framework is introduced.

### CLM-016 — Project Envelope Slots

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Specification.md","line_end":82,"line_start":68,"source_sha256":"6f286962f9f6d2f85f960339c3643e92ff834ab1b0e28c2dc16896cd4ea55a36","target_id":"CLM-016"} -->
###### Project Envelope Slots

| Slot | Minimum contract content | Verification note |
|---|---|---|
| `document_metadata` | Document kind, schema version, project/document identity, and version-handling metadata. | Fixture exposes version fields and migration status or diagnostic behavior. |
| `project` | Project identity, design-basis metadata, storage policy/private-data indicators, and report settings where applicable. | Fields align to `Project` object scope in `docs/SPEC.md` section 3; exact field names TBD. |
| `units` | Declared unit system and/or explicit unit metadata on numerical values. | Missing units and incompatible dimensions fail with deterministic findings. |
| `model` | Nodes, elements, sections, materials, components, supports, and references used by the persisted model where present. | Round-trip comparison verifies stable identity and references, not text formatting. |
| `loads` | Load cases and load records with units and source/provenance where needed. | Round-trip comparison verifies load IDs, types, magnitudes, units, and source fields where present. |
| `rule_pack_refs` | Rule-pack ID/name, version, checksum, source note, redistribution/private status, and required-input linkages where present. | Public fixtures reference only invented or permissively licensed rule packs. |
| `provenance` | Source/provenance and redistribution/review metadata for public data records; private/source labels where project records are private. | Public data records follow `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md` section 4 fields. |
| `diagnostics_and_migration` | Validation findings, migration status, and structured result-envelope diagnostics. | Unsupported, stale, and failed migration cases have deterministic diagnostics. |
| `reproducibility` | Model hash, input-manifest compatibility, solver/report linkage where applicable, and rule-pack checksum references. | Hash inputs are identified and stable for canonical JSON payloads. |
| `review_records` | Optional human review labels and hashes for project-specific acceptance records. | Any review label remains human authority only and cannot be generated as code compliance. |

### CLM-017 — Round-Trip Equality Criteria

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Specification.md","line_end":93,"line_start":83,"source_sha256":"6f286962f9f6d2f85f960339c3643e92ff834ab1b0e28c2dc16896cd4ea55a36","target_id":"CLM-017"} -->
###### Round-Trip Equality Criteria

| Category | Equal after round trip when | Failure examples |
|---|---|---|
| Model content | Stable object IDs, object types, references, coordinates/geometry fields, component/material/section references, and support/load associations remain semantically equivalent. | Missing object, changed reference, changed engineering-relevant value, or unreported schema loss. |
| Unit metadata | Explicit units or declared unit-system references remain present and dimensionally compatible. | Missing unit, incompatible unit dimension, or silent default insertion. |
| Loads | Load-case IDs, load types, magnitudes, units, and source/provenance fields where present are preserved. | Changed magnitude, missing units, lost load case, or lost source note. |
| Rule-pack references | ID/name, version, checksum, source note, private/public or redistribution status, and required-input linkages remain present. | Expanded protected rules in public artifacts, checksum loss, or private/public status loss. |
| Provenance metadata | Provenance fields required for engineering-reliance data remain present or generate findings when missing. | Lost source, lost redistribution status, or missing provenance accepted as complete. |
| Reproducibility metadata | Canonical JSON payload hash basis and input-manifest compatibility are reproducible for the selected payload/manifest partition. | Hash includes volatile/session fields without approved basis, or payload partition is undocumented. |

### CLM-018 — Migration Status Semantics

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Specification.md","line_end":103,"line_start":94,"source_sha256":"6f286962f9f6d2f85f960339c3643e92ff834ab1b0e28c2dc16896cd4ea55a36","target_id":"CLM-018"} -->
###### Migration Status Semantics

| Status / case | Required handling | Open detail |
|---|---|---|
| Supported/current schema | Validate and round-trip without migration diagnostics. | Runtime version-check status `current`; accepted authoring family `0.2.0`. |
| Unsupported schema | Return a structured diagnostic and avoid silent coercion. | Runtime status `unsupported_schema`. |
| Stale schema | Report migration-needed status or diagnostic before accepting as current. | Version-check status `stale`; separate migration evidence reports `migrated` when the governed path succeeds. |
| Failed migration | Return a structured failure diagnostic with affected object/source where available. | Runtime status `failed`; rollback/transaction details remain bounded by the existing persistence operation. |
| Newer-than-supported schema | Refuse down-migration and emit a structured diagnostic. | Runtime status `newer_than_supported`. |

###### Persistence Service Operations

| Operation | Minimum inputs | Minimum outputs / diagnostics | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Create project | Project identity, unit system, storage/private-data policy, optional template/reference selection. | Versioned project envelope or diagnostics/result envelope. | Exact constructor/API shape TBD. |
| Open project | Project artifact reference and caller context. | Parsed project envelope, validation result, migration status, diagnostics. | Must not bypass schema, unit, provenance, or data-boundary checks. |
| Save project | Validated project envelope, target artifact reference, canonicalization/hash options. | Saved artifact reference, version metadata, hash/manifest evidence, diagnostics. | Physical container remains TBD. |
| Validate project | Project envelope or artifact reference. | Schema, unit, provenance, rule-pack-reference, private-data, and protected-content diagnostics. | Diagnostics use structured result-envelope fields. |
| Version check | Project schema/version metadata. | `current`, `stale`, `unsupported_schema`, `failed`, or `newer_than_supported` status and diagnostics. | Implemented for the bounded DEC-019/DEC-033 runtime; no additional names introduced. |
| Migrate project | Source project, target schema version, migration policy. | Migrated project or failed migration diagnostics. | Migration framework/tooling TBD. |

### CLM-020 — Diagnostic Class Coverage

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Specification.md","line_end":129,"line_start":115,"source_sha256":"6f286962f9f6d2f85f960339c3643e92ff834ab1b0e28c2dc16896cd4ea55a36","target_id":"CLM-020"} -->
###### Diagnostic Class Coverage

| Class / namespace | Applies when | Source basis |
|---|---|---|
| `SCHEMA_VALIDATION` (PROPOSAL) | Project envelope or object payload violates schema. | SOW-041; JSON Schema 2020-12 baseline. |
| `MIGRATION` (PROPOSAL) | Schema version is unsupported, stale, or migration fails. | AB-00-04; OI-011. |
| `UNIT_METADATA` (PROPOSAL) | Unit metadata is missing or incompatible. | OPS-K-UNIT-1; PRD FR-002. |
| `PROVENANCE_WARNING` | Source/provenance is missing or weak. | `docs/SPEC.md` section 7; OPS-K-DATA-2/3. |
| `RULE_CHECK_BLOCKING` | Mechanics may exist, but required user/rule-pack data is missing. | `docs/SPEC.md` section 7; PRD section 14.4. |
| `IP_BOUNDARY_WARNING` | Public contribution, fixture, report hook, or export may expose protected/private content. | `docs/SPEC.md` section 7; IP/data-boundary policy. |
| `PRIVATE_DATA` (PROPOSAL) | An operation would transmit, commit, export, or publish private project/rule/library data by default. | OPS-K-PRIV-1; PRD section 18. |
| `PROFESSIONAL_BOUNDARY` (PROPOSAL) | A status or artifact could imply certification, sealing, approval, authentication, or automatic code compliance. | OPS-K-AUTH-1; `docs/TYPES.md` section 4. |

PROPOSAL: Exact diagnostic code prefixes remain TBD; the table above records required deterministic coverage, not final code names.

##### Standards

| Standard / basis | Applicability | Status |
|---|---|---|
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Public schema/interchange baseline for the project file schema. | Required by SCA-001; exact schema file layout TBD. |
| Canonical JSON / JCS-compatible canonicalization | Hash basis for JSON payloads. | Required by SCA-001; exact library/tooling TBD. |
| OpenPipeStress invariant catalog | Binding constraints for IP boundary, unit safety, provenance, professional boundary, private data, and agent outputs. | Required by `docs/CONTRACT.md`. |
| OpenPipeStress data-boundary policy | Controls public/private data handling and provenance fields. | Required by `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md`. |

No piping design code or protected standards dataset is a governing input to this deliverable. The persistence schema may carry user-supplied rule-pack references and provenance, but it must not bundle protected code content.

##### Documentation

The deliverable should leave or update these records:

- project file schema documentation, including schema version, migration status semantics, canonicalization/hash basis, and unresolved implementation TBDs;
- persistence service contract documentation for create/open/save/version validation and diagnostics/result envelopes;
- round-trip test documentation naming fixtures, expected preserved fields, semantic equality checks, canonical hash expectations, and protected-content/provenance gates;
- diagnostic taxonomy coverage and migration-status case matrix, with exact code names/status names marked TBD where not approved;
- fixture/public-data review evidence covering provenance, redistribution status, protected-content screening, private-data handling, and professional-boundary language;
- open decisions for physical project package/container, migration framework/tooling, binary asset packaging, exact schema file layout, dependency/tool selections, and hash payload partitioning;
- no protected standards excerpts, proprietary data, or code-compliance/certification claims.
<!-- sow-source-end -->

- **AC-001** — The contract preserves the accepted source requirements for schema-governed local persistence, deterministic round trips, explicit units and provenance, validated service boundaries, and unresolved physical-container or migration decisions.

##### D-41 R5 T7 PDU-055 current declaration

Current authority is `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` revision 0.8, approved `execution/_DAG/DAG-007/` graph context, and D-41/`DEC-074` through the completed T1-T6 bounded records. The implemented working-tree slice and its evidence supersede this surface's setup-only, future-only, or overtaken TBD wording as a current declaration; that earlier wording remains historical setup context only.

Surviving deliverable-local residuals and gates are those recorded in `_STATUS.md ## Remaining`; dated MEMORY and formal-review history remain unchanged. This refresh does not imply lifecycle, review, validation, release, professional-reliance, or code-compliance closure.

##### PDU-024 Version Contract Check

1. Evaluate the in-document semantic version through the established migration evaluator.
2. Emit `current` only for the accepted `0.2.0` family; map a successful older-version migration path to `stale` at version-check grain and retain `migrated` in the migration record.
3. Emit structured `unsupported_schema`, `newer_than_supported`, or `failed` diagnostics without coercion.
4. Exercise current, stale, unsupported, newer, and failed classifications in focused contract tests and verify the Project Validation, Export Review, and Report consumers do not contain stale current-version comparisons.

### CLM-027 — Purpose

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Procedure.md","line_end":22,"line_start":19,"source_sha256":"fe11a411d76b89740faf8e15ff6f4715d57d13e6d11bf0d3ee7673b8e6b2bf52","target_id":"CLM-027"} -->
##### Purpose

This procedure describes how to produce and check the DEL-02-05 artifacts: project file schema, round-trip tests, and persistence service contract. It is operational guidance for implementation and review; it does not itself implement the schema or service.

<!-- sow-source-end -->

### CLM-028 — Prerequisites

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Procedure.md","line_end":30,"line_start":23,"source_sha256":"fe11a411d76b89740faf8e15ff6f4715d57d13e6d11bf0d3ee7673b8e6b2bf52","target_id":"CLM-028"} -->
##### Prerequisites

- Confirm the active deliverable is DEL-02-05 under PKG-02 and that write scope is limited to the deliverable-local artifacts. Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `docs/AGENTIC_DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` section 4.
- Use `_CONTEXT.md` revision 0.7, `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` revision 0.7, and register rows for DEL-02-05, SOW-050, SOW-041, and ContextBudgetQA DEL-02-05.
- Apply SCA-001 basis IDs AB-00-01, AB-00-02, AB-00-03, AB-00-04, AB-00-06, AB-00-07, and AB-00-08 only to the extent they constrain this persistence deliverable.
- Treat `_DEPENDENCIES.md` as human-owned dependency context. Current state: no specific upstream/downstream dependency list was declared.
- Keep protected standards/code data, proprietary values, and code-compliance/certification claims out of public artifacts. Source: `docs/CONTRACT.md`; `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md`.

### CLM-029 — Steps

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Procedure.md","line_end":87,"line_start":31,"source_sha256":"fe11a411d76b89740faf8e15ff6f4715d57d13e6d11bf0d3ee7673b8e6b2bf52","target_id":"CLM-029"} -->
##### Steps

1. Confirm scope and lifecycle state.
   - Verify the deliverable folder, status, allowed writes, and anticipated artifacts.
   - Stop or escalate if the task requires protected data or expands outside project persistence.

2. Establish the source set.
   - Read `_CONTEXT.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, `docs/_Registers/*.csv` rows for this deliverable, `docs/CONTRACT.md`, and the relevant SOFTWARE_DECOMP sections.
   - Record missing or inaccessible sources as warnings; do not invent requirements.

3. Define the persistence boundary.
   - Include create/open/save/version behavior, project schema, round-trip serialization, and service diagnostics.
   - Exclude numerical solving, GUI views, rule-pack evaluator behavior, report rendering, external API transport, and physical package/container decisions unless a later brief authorizes them.

4. Draft or update the project file schema contract.
   - Include schema/version metadata, migration status, project identity, unit-system references, model payload, load payloads, rule-pack references, and provenance metadata.
   - Enumerate the logical project-envelope slots before choosing exact files or generated types: document metadata, project identity/storage policy, unit system, model payload, load payloads, rule-pack references, provenance/redistribution metadata, diagnostics/migration status, reproducibility metadata, and optional review records.
   - For rule-pack references, capture ID/name, version, checksum, source note, redistribution/private status, and missing/private-reference diagnostics without embedding protected rule content in public artifacts.
   - For provenance-bearing public data records, include source, source location, license or redistribution basis, contributor certification, redistribution status, and review status when applicable.
   - Use JSON Schema 2020-12 as the public schema/interchange baseline.
   - Mark exact schema file layout, code-generation tooling, migration framework, and physical project container as TBD unless already resolved by an approved decision.

5. Define the persistence service contract.
   - Specify create/open/save/validate/version-check/migrate entry points and expected result envelopes.
   - For each operation, document minimum inputs, outputs, diagnostics, and boundary checks:
     - create: project identity, declared unit system, storage/private-data policy, and optional template/reference selection;
     - open: project artifact reference, schema/version handling, validation, migration status, and diagnostics;
     - save: validated project envelope, target artifact reference, canonicalization/hash evidence, and diagnostics;
     - validate: schema, unit, provenance, rule-pack-reference, private-data, and protected-content diagnostics;
     - version-check/migrate: unsupported, stale, failed, and TBD newer/current status handling.
   - Require structured diagnostics for validation, migration, protected-content, private-data, unit, provenance, rule-pack-reference, and professional-boundary failures or warnings.
   - Preserve application-service/domain-core/storage boundaries; adapters and plugins cannot bypass validation or data-boundary checks.

6. Define canonicalization and reproducibility handling.
   - Use canonical JSON with JCS-compatible canonicalization as the basis for JSON payload hashes.
   - Record whether each hash applies to a normalized JSON payload, input manifest, referenced private/rule/library artifact, or non-JSON/binary asset manifest. Exact split is TBD.
   - Document which fields are excluded from deterministic comparison because they are volatile, environment-specific, or session-only. If exclusion cannot be justified from source or approved decision, mark the partition TBD.
   - Avoid relying on non-deterministic field ordering, timestamps, machine-local paths, or session-only state for deterministic comparisons.

7. Build the round-trip test plan.
   - Include a fixture inventory with valid invented fixtures and invalid fixtures.
   - Minimum fixture classes: valid minimal invented project; invalid schema shape; missing units; incompatible unit metadata; missing/weak provenance; private rule-pack reference; missing rule-pack reference; unsupported/stale/failed migration version cases; and synthetic protected-content/private-data boundary warnings that do not include actual protected data.
   - Test parse -> validate/normalize -> serialize -> parse cycles for semantic equality.
   - Test semantic equality by category: model identity/references, unit metadata, loads, rule-pack references, provenance metadata, and reproducibility metadata.
   - Test canonical output/hash stability for JSON payloads and record expected canonical JSON/hash outputs for each fixture where the payload partition is known.
   - Test unit metadata preservation, missing provenance findings, migration status handling, rule-pack reference preservation, and private/protected data boundary checks.

8. Review public-data safety.
   - Confirm public fixtures are invented, original, public-domain, or permissively licensed.
   - Confirm no protected standards text, protected tables, proprietary formulas, material allowables, copied SIF/flexibility data, or commercial examples are present.
   - Confirm no persisted status claims automatic code compliance or professional approval.
   - Produce or update a `public_fixture_data_boundary_review` record (PROPOSAL; final path TBD) with fixture name, source/provenance, redistribution status, contributor certification, protected-content review status, private-data review status, and professional-boundary review status.

9. Record open items.
   - Keep physical project package/container, migration framework/tooling, binary asset packaging, exact schema file layout, public API transport, dependency versions, diagnostic code names, status labels, and hash payload partitioning as TBD unless resolved by human/architecture decision.
   - Record the open-decision artifact path as TBD until the repo-level ADR/open-decision convention is approved; AB-00-01 requires decision records, and OI-011 assigns physical container/migration details to PKG-02 / human architecture decision.

##### Verification

| Check | Expected result |
|---|---|
| Scope check | Artifacts address DEL-02-05 only and do not implement solver, GUI, reporting, rule evaluator, or external transport behavior. |
| Schema check | Project fixtures validate against JSON Schema 2020-12 contracts; invalid fixtures fail deterministically; each logical project-envelope slot is covered or explicitly marked TBD. |
| Round-trip check | Required model, unit, load, rule-pack reference, provenance, and reproducibility metadata survives round trip without semantic loss. |
| Equality check | The test plan states per-category equality criteria for model content, unit metadata, loads, rule-pack references, provenance metadata, and reproducibility metadata. |
| Canonicalization check | JSON payloads produce stable canonical serialization and stable JCS-compatible hash inputs; the payload/manifest partition is documented or marked TBD. |
| Migration check | Unsupported, stale, and failed migration cases produce explicit migration status or diagnostics; newer/current status labels remain TBD unless approved. |
| Unit/provenance check | Missing/inconsistent unit metadata and missing/weak provenance are surfaced as findings. |
| Rule-pack reference check | Rule-pack reference ID/name, version, checksum, source note, and private/public or redistribution status survive round trip without exposing protected rule content. |
| Boundary check | Public fixtures contain no protected standards/code data, no proprietary values, no private rule-pack expansion, and no compliance/certification claims. |
| Service-contract check | Create/open/save/validate/version-check/migrate failures return structured diagnostics/result envelopes with affected objects and remediation where applicable. |
| Review-record check | Public fixture/data-boundary review evidence names provenance, redistribution status, protected-content review, private-data review, and professional-boundary review disposition. |

- **VER-001** — Validate the contract and review source parity, round-trip semantic preservation, canonical serialization and hash behavior, version diagnostics, private-data and protected-content boundaries, and absence of professional-approval claims.

## Governing Values and Decisions — Axiology

### CLM-032 — Guidance - DEL-02-05 Project Persistence and Round-Trip Serialization

### CLM-033 — D-41 R5 T7 PDU-055 current declaration

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":11,"line_start":4,"source_sha256":"47cbb14040ddd38731e44263c64209f429c724641de1bfe41fa2ac104b7ada74","target_id":"CLM-033"} -->
##### D-41 R5 T7 PDU-055 current declaration

Current authority is `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` revision 0.8, approved `execution/_DAG/DAG-007/` graph context, and D-41/`DEC-074` through the completed T1-T6 bounded records. The implemented working-tree slice and its evidence supersede this surface's setup-only, future-only, or overtaken TBD wording as a current declaration; that earlier wording remains historical setup context only.

Surviving deliverable-local residuals and gates are those recorded in `_STATUS.md ## Remaining`; dated MEMORY and formal-review history remain unchanged. This refresh does not imply lifecycle, review, validation, release, professional-reliance, or code-compliance closure.

PDU-055 cited claim(s): `DEL-02-05-DECL-003`.

### CLM-034 — PDU-024 Version Handling Guidance

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":15,"line_start":12,"source_sha256":"47cbb14040ddd38731e44263c64209f429c724641de1bfe41fa2ac104b7ada74","target_id":"CLM-034"} -->
##### PDU-024 Version Handling Guidance

Do not compare UI model-document versions against duplicated literals. Use `evaluateModelDocumentLocal` and `modelDocumentVersionCheckStatus`, mirroring the backend DEC-019/DEC-033 evaluator. Treat `0.2.0` as current; treat a migratable `0.1.0` source as stale at version-check grain while retaining `migrated` in migration evidence. Unsupported, newer, and failed versions must remain explicit and must not be coerced.

### CLM-035 — Purpose

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":19,"line_start":16,"source_sha256":"47cbb14040ddd38731e44263c64209f429c724641de1bfe41fa2ac104b7ada74","target_id":"CLM-035"} -->
##### Purpose

DEL-02-05 exists to make project files auditable, deterministic, and reusable across the OpenPipeStress workflow. The persistence layer is the handoff surface between domain schemas, unit-aware modeling, rule-pack references, solver inputs, reports, automation, and future adapters. Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` SOW-050 and OBJ-012.

### CLM-036 — Principles

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":29,"line_start":20,"source_sha256":"47cbb14040ddd38731e44263c64209f429c724641de1bfe41fa2ac104b7ada74","target_id":"CLM-036"} -->
##### Principles

- Treat the project file as a versioned domain artifact, not as an implementation dump. Required persisted content must be described by schema and service contracts. Source: `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` AB-00-04.
- Preserve semantics, not formatting accidents. Round-trip success means required project content is preserved and canonical JSON/hash behavior is deterministic. Source: `docs/PRD.md` section 10 FR-001; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` AB-00-04.
- Keep units explicit. Every numerical value that can affect solving, rule checks, reports, or exports needs unit metadata or a traceable unit-system reference. Source: `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-UNIT-1.
- Preserve provenance. Missing provenance is a finding or warning, not a reason to invent source information. Source: `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-DATA-2 and OPS-K-DATA-3; `docs/TYPES.md` section 5.
- Store rule-pack references and checksums without bundling protected rule content into public project examples. Source: `docs/SPEC.md` section 6; `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md` sections 3, 6, and 7.
- Route persistence through application/service/storage boundaries that keep validation and diagnostics enforceable. Source: `docs/SPEC.md` section 1; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` AB-00-02, AB-00-03, AB-00-06, and AB-00-07.
- Separate software-computed state from professional approval. Persistence may record user-rule check states or human review records only with appropriate authority labels and hashes; it must not turn software output into code compliance. Source: `docs/TYPES.md` section 4; `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-AUTH-1 and OPS-K-AUTH-2.

### CLM-037 — Considerations

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":41,"line_start":30,"source_sha256":"47cbb14040ddd38731e44263c64209f429c724641de1bfe41fa2ac104b7ada74","target_id":"CLM-037"} -->
##### Considerations

- Use a schema-versioned project envelope with explicit document kind, project identity, schema version, unit-system reference, migration status, and payload sections. ASSUMPTION: this envelope shape is a suitable implementation pattern; the exact schema file layout remains TBD under SCA-001.
- Make canonicalization scope explicit before hashing. A hash over volatile, environment-specific, or session-only fields will undermine reproducibility. The exact hash payload subset is TBD; the binding basis is canonical JSON with JCS-compatible canonicalization for JSON payloads.
- Preserve unknowns as `TBD`, `UNKNOWN_SOURCE`, warnings, or diagnostics rather than filling defaults. This applies especially to units, provenance, rule-pack references, and migration status.
- Keep public fixtures small and invented. They can verify schema shape and round-trip behavior without exposing protected standards data, proprietary values, or commercial software examples.
- Represent private data boundaries in the contract. Project files may reference private libraries and rule packs, but the public project must not assume those files are redistributable.
- Design diagnostics for machine and user review. Open/save/migrate failures should identify affected objects, source, severity, remediation, and provenance rather than returning unstructured text only.
- Avoid overclaiming SCA-001. The architecture basis resolves JSON Schema 2020-12, canonical JSON/JCS-compatible hash basis, schema-first envelopes, and test-gate classes; it does not resolve exact dependency versions, physical container, migration framework, or binary packaging.
- Record unresolved persistence decisions in an ADR/open-decision mechanism before implementation depends on them. Source: `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` AB-00-01, section 8.2, and OI-011.
- Treat local-first behavior as a boundary condition for persistence, not only as a publication policy. Create/open/save must not imply cloud storage, public commit, telemetry, or redistribution of private project/rule/library data by default; the exact split between persistence checks and PKG-12 privacy controls remains TBD. Source: `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-PRIV-1; `docs/PRD.md` sections 18.1-18.3.

### CLM-038 — Vocabulary Normalization

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":53,"line_start":42,"source_sha256":"47cbb14040ddd38731e44263c64209f429c724641de1bfe41fa2ac104b7ada74","target_id":"CLM-038"} -->
###### Vocabulary Normalization

Use these terms consistently until a human/architecture decision replaces them:

| Term | Use in DEL-02-05 | Avoid using it to mean |
|---|---|---|
| Project document | The logical persisted project content governed by schema and round-trip requirements. | A specific file extension or physical package format. |
| Project envelope | The versioned top-level contract containing metadata, payload slots, diagnostics/migration status, and reproducibility metadata. | A final schema file path or code-generated type. |
| Project file | A user-facing persistence artifact created/opened/saved by the product. | A commitment to a single JSON file. |
| Project package/container | The physical storage choice, such as single file versus packaged container. | A settled decision; this remains TBD under SCA-001/OI-011. |
| Input manifest | A reproducibility record that identifies hash inputs, referenced artifacts, and private/rule/library checksums where applicable. | A report approval or compliance claim. |

### CLM-039 — Trade-offs

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":65,"line_start":54,"source_sha256":"47cbb14040ddd38731e44263c64209f429c724641de1bfe41fa2ac104b7ada74","target_id":"CLM-039"} -->
##### Trade-offs

| Decision area | Conservative guidance | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Single JSON file vs packaged project container | Keep the physical package/container TBD until a human/architecture decision resolves it. | SCA-001 explicitly leaves the container unresolved. |
| Schema file layout and code generation | Record the exact schema layout/tooling decision in an ADR or open-decision log before implementation depends on it. | SCA-001 selects JSON Schema 2020-12 but leaves exact schema file layout and code-generation tooling TBD. |
| Embedded rule-pack data vs references | Prefer references with version/checksum/source notes for persistence; avoid embedding protected or private rule content in public examples. | Maintains code-neutral and private-data boundaries. |
| Human-readable JSON vs strict canonical form | Permit authoring/readability where useful, but tests should compare normalized semantic content and canonical JSON/hash output. | Determinism is required for reproducibility. |
| Full-file hash vs payload/manifests | Use canonical JSON for JSON payload hashes and manifest hashes for non-JSON/binary assets; exact split is TBD. | Matches SCA-001 without deciding binary package structure prematurely. |
| Migration now vs migration framework later | Require schema version and migration status now; leave migration framework/tooling TBD. | This records compatibility boundaries without inventing implementation details. |
| Local project operations vs public sharing | Make create/open/save local-first by default; treat public export, bug-report attachment, telemetry, and repository commit as separately reviewed actions. | PRD section 18 and OPS-K-PRIV-1 prohibit default transmission or public commitment of private project data. |

### CLM-040 — Examples

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":71,"line_start":66,"source_sha256":"47cbb14040ddd38731e44263c64209f429c724641de1bfe41fa2ac104b7ada74","target_id":"CLM-040"} -->
##### Examples

TBD. No deliverable-specific project file example was available in the accessible sources. Any future public fixture should use invented or permissively licensed data, include provenance/redistribution fields where data records exist, and avoid protected standards/code content.

Future fixtures should also carry a durable review record with, at minimum, source name/location, license or redistribution basis, contributor certification, review status, and confirmation that the fixture does not include protected standards/code data, proprietary values, or professional approval claims.
