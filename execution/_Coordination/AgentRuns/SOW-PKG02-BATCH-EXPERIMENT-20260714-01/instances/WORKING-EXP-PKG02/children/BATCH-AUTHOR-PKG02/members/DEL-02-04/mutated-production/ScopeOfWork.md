# Scope of Work — DEL-02-04

## Purpose and Objective Traceability

This Scope of Work defines `DEL-02-04` in service of project scope [SOW-038] and package objectives [OBJ-009].

- **OUT-001** — Plugin and extension domain contracts defining governed extension points, adapter boundaries, permissions, and schema-first application-service access are produced for the declared scope and objective.

### CLM-007 — Construction

> ##### Construction
>
> The DEL-02-04 contract kit is constructed from the following conservative parts:
>
> | Part | Status | Notes |
> |---|---|---|
> | Plugin interface spec | Draft target | Must define extension point identity, lifecycle status, schema version, capability declarations, diagnostic envelope use, and validation obligations. Exact schema file layout is TBD. |
> | Sandbox/permission model notes | Draft target | Must express deny-bypass constraints for units, provenance, data boundary, diagnostics, report controls, and rule sandboxing. Exact runtime mechanism is TBD. |
> | Extension point registry | ASSUMPTION / TBD approval record | Candidate families are import adapter, export adapter, report/output extension, validation hook, and rule-pack integration hook. Approved registry names, registry ownership, and a decision/open-issue pointer are TBD. Concrete public API transport and format support remain TBD. |
> | Capability/permission declarations | ASSUMPTION / TBD approval record | Candidate classes for later review are governed project mutation, read-only query access, private-library access, filesystem path access, network access, report/export generation, background job execution, and rule-pack evaluator integration. Exact permission names, grant records, enforcement implementation, and approval path remain TBD. |
> | Human-ruling log pointer | TBD | Needed before exact extension registry, permission taxonomy, sandbox mechanism, transport binding, or telemetry/private-data exposure can be treated as approved. SourcePath: `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md`; SectionRef: DEC-012 and OI-004. |
> | Provenance and redistribution metadata | Required concept | Public data records require source, source location, license, contributor certification, redistribution status, and review status. SourcePath: `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md`; SectionRef: 4. Required provenance fields. |
> | Verification hooks | Required concept | Future implementation should support schema validation, unit checks, protected-content/provenance gates, and adapter/plugin tests. SourcePath: `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md`; SectionRef: 8.1 Architecture basis register, AB-00-08. |

### CLM-014 — Verification

> ##### Verification
>
> | Requirement IDs | Verification approach |
> |---|---|
> | REQ-01, REQ-09, REQ-10 | Architecture review confirms plugin/adapter calls enter through governed service/domain contracts and cannot bypass validation, diagnostics, envelopes, or report controls. |
> | REQ-02 | Unit schema tests and dimensional validation tests reject incompatible units and surface missing-unit diagnostics. |
> | REQ-03, REQ-04 | Provenance-field schema validation and contribution-review checklist confirm required source, license, contributor, redistribution, and review metadata. |
> | REQ-05, REQ-06 | Protected-content/provenance gate and quarantine procedure exercise public and private data paths with invented non-code fixtures only. |
> | REQ-07 | Diagnostic envelope tests confirm required fields and warning class propagation for plugin/adapter failures. |
> | REQ-08 | Report/template and message review confirms no certification, approval, endorsement, or code-compliance claims. |
> | REQ-11, REQ-12 | Schema validation and canonicalization/hash tests verify manifest and envelope stability once concrete schemas exist. |
> | REQ-13 | Security tests for any rule-pack-facing hook confirm no arbitrary code, filesystem, or network access unless a later human-approved sandbox design allows a bounded capability. |
> | REQ-14 | Layered test plan maps plugin/adapter behavior to schema, unit, provenance, diagnostics, protected-content, and regression gates. |
> | REQ-15, REQ-17 | Review confirms implementation-level TBDs remain visible and are not silently resolved or treated as approved capabilities. |
> | REQ-16 | Manifest/interface documentation review confirms each concept slot is present as an approved field or explicit `TBD` placeholder. |
> | REQ-18 | Privacy/security review confirms plugins/adapters do not receive telemetry-facing or private engineering data by default; any exception has an explicit human ruling and test evidence. |

### CLM-015 — Verification acceptance criteria and interim gates

> ###### Verification acceptance criteria and interim gates
>
> | Gate | Applies to | Pass/hold criteria |
> |---|---|---|
> | Schema/manifest review gate | REQ-11, REQ-12, REQ-16 | Hold until concrete schema layout, field names, transport binding, and code-generation tooling are either approved or carried as explicit `TBD`; pass only with schema validation and canonicalization/hash evidence where hashing is required. |
> | Layered plugin/adapter gate | REQ-01 through REQ-14 | Pass only when schema, unit, provenance, diagnostics, protected-content/provenance, and regression evidence is present or the missing evidence is explicitly recorded as `TBD`/open risk for human review. |
> | Rule-pack sandbox gate | REQ-13 | Pass only when tests demonstrate deterministic, unit-aware behavior and no arbitrary code execution or unauthorized filesystem/network access. Exact sandbox technology remains TBD until approved. |
> | Human-ruling gate | REQ-15, REQ-17, REQ-18 | Hold until open decisions for transport, registry, permission taxonomy, sandbox mechanism, import/export formats, telemetry/private-data exposure, and approval owner are recorded or explicitly deferred. |
> | Diagnostic class check | REQ-02, REQ-03, REQ-05, REQ-06, REQ-07, REQ-13 | Pass only when missing units, weak provenance, protected-content risk, assumptions, and rule-blocking outcomes surface through the existing warning/diagnostic classes where applicable; exact severity taxonomy beyond the source-defined classes remains TBD. |

### CLM-020 — Purpose

> ##### Purpose
>
> This procedure describes how to produce and later maintain the DEL-02-04 plugin/extension domain contract artifacts without expanding beyond the sealed PKG-02 domain/API scope or introducing protected/private data into public artifacts.
>

### CLM-021 — Prerequisites

> ##### Prerequisites
>
> - Sealed deliverable context for DEL-02-04 with explicit write scope. SourcePath: `_CONTEXT.md`; SectionRef: Context: DEL-02-04.
> - Current `_STATUS.md` state that permits drafting or update. For this Pass 3 run, state is `SEMANTIC_READY`; the prior Pass 1+2 drafting history includes `OPEN` as recorded in `_STATUS.md`.
> - Scope, deliverable, and context-budget register rows for DEL-02-04 and SOW-038. SourcePath: `docs/_Registers/Deliverables.csv`; SectionRef: row DEL-02-04. SourcePath: `docs/_Registers/ScopeLedger.csv`; SectionRef: row SOW-038. SourcePath: `docs/_Registers/ContextBudgetQA.csv`; SectionRef: row DEL-02-04.
> - Applicable contract invariants from `docs/CONTRACT.md`, especially IP/data boundary, unit safety, rule sandboxing, report controls, privacy, and agent epistemic constraints.
> - SCA-001 architecture basis IDs AB-00-01, AB-00-02, AB-00-03, AB-00-04, AB-00-06, AB-00-07, and AB-00-08. SourcePath: `_CONTEXT.md`; SectionRef: Architecture Basis Injection.
> - No human-declared upstream/downstream dependency list is available in `_DEPENDENCIES.md`; dependencies are coordinated externally by humans. ASSUMPTION: implementation work may later need outputs from DEL-02-01 and DEL-02-02, but this document kit does not add that dependency.

>    - Verify deliverable ID `DEL-02-04`, package `PKG-02`, type `API_CONTRACT`, scope item `SOW-038`, and objective `OBJ-009`.
>    - Confirm the work is limited to plugin/adapter domain/API contract artifacts and does not implement runtime loading, external formats, solver behavior, or GUI views.
>
> 2. Gather governing source slices.
>    - Read `_CONTEXT.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, and the DEL-02-04 rows in the registers.
>    - Read `docs/CONTRACT.md`, `docs/TYPES.md`, `docs/SPEC.md`, `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md`, `docs/DIRECTIVE.md`, `docs/VALIDATION_STRATEGY.md`, and relevant SCA-001 rows in `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md`.
>    - Use PRD sections only as supporting context where the decomposition or scope ledger cites them.
>
> 3. Define the plugin interface specification at contract level.
>    - Identify required manifest concepts: plugin identity, version, extension point declarations, schema/envelope version, capability request, provenance/data-boundary declaration, diagnostics compatibility, and review status.
>    - Mark exact schema file layout, field names, code-generation tooling, and transport binding as `TBD` unless later source material resolves them.
>
> 4. Define extension point families conservatively.
>    - Candidate families are import adapter, export adapter, report/output extension, validation hook, and rule-pack integration hook.
>    - Mark the registry as ASSUMPTION until the human project authority or later architecture/API deliverables approve concrete extension point names.
>
> 5. Apply mandatory no-bypass controls.
>    - Require unit-aware validation for dimensional/numerical data.
>    - Require source/provenance, redistribution status, and review disposition for imported or public data.
>    - Require diagnostics/result-envelope compatibility for plugin/adapter failures and warnings.
>    - Require protected-content, public/private data-boundary, and report-control checks before data is committed, exported, or included in public artifacts.
>    - Prohibit certification, approval, endorsement, or automatic code-compliance claims.
>
> 6. Draft sandbox and permission model notes.
>    - Start from deny-by-default.
>    - Record capability classes as ASSUMPTION/TBD until implementation design resolves them.
>    - Include at least these candidate classes for later review: governed project mutation, read-only query access, private-library access, filesystem path access, network access, report/export generation, background job execution, and rule-pack evaluator integration.
>    - Do not resolve exact sandbox technology, process isolation, permissions syntax, or storage paths in this deliverable.
>
> 7. Map requirements to verification.
>    - For every normative requirement, define a future verification path: schema validation, unit tests, provenance checks, protected-content gates, diagnostics envelope tests, rule-sandbox tests, or architecture review.
>    - Use invented, public-safe fixtures only.
>
> 8. Perform cross-document consistency review.
>    - Confirm Datasheet attributes appear in Specification requirements where appropriate.
>    - Confirm Specification requirements have Guidance rationale and Procedure verification hooks.
>    - Replace unsupported detail with `TBD` or `ASSUMPTION`.
>    - Add or update the Guidance conflict table if sources disagree.
>
> 9. Stop and escalate when needed.
>    - Stop if protected standards/proprietary data is needed, if permission/sandbox design would require resolving a human security decision, if a requirement would blur user-rule status with professional approval, or if source conflicts affect safety or code-relevant values.

### CLM-023 — Verification

> ##### Verification
>
> Completion checks for this deliverable:
>
> - `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, and `Procedure.md` exist and retain the default required sections.
> - Scope remains DEL-02-04 and PKG-02; no files outside the allowed write targets are modified.
> - Requirements cite accessible source slices or are labeled ASSUMPTION/TBD.
> - No protected standards/code text, copied tables, copied code formulas, proprietary commercial data, or private project/rule/library data is introduced.
> - No statement claims certification, sealing, approval, endorsement, or automatic engineering code compliance.
> - Terms are used consistently: plugin/adapter, extension point, schema-first envelope, unit-aware validation, provenance, diagnostics/result envelope, public/private data boundary, and report controls.
> - Remaining implementation details are visible as TBD, especially public API transport, import/export format list, exact permission taxonomy, exact sandbox mechanism, exact dependency versions, CI thresholds, and concrete schema layout.
>

### CLM-024 — Records

> ##### Records
>
> - `Datasheet.md` records deliverable identity, attributes, conditions, construction assumptions, and source references.
> - `Specification.md` records normative requirements, standards/baselines, verification mapping, and documentation obligations.
> - `Guidance.md` records rationale, principles, considerations, trade-offs, invented safe examples, and conflict status.
> - `Procedure.md` records the production and maintenance procedure for the contract kit.
> - Future manifest/schema review record should identify the approved fields or explicit `TBD` placeholders for plugin identity/version, extension declarations, schema/envelope version, capability declarations, provenance/data-boundary declarations, diagnostics compatibility, and review/status metadata.
> - Future canonicalization/hash verification record should identify the manifest or payload schema version, canonicalization basis, sample invented fixtures, expected hashes, and unresolved `TBD` items when JSON hashing is required.
> - Future sandbox/privacy verification record should document rule-pack-facing sandbox tests, denied arbitrary-code/filesystem/network paths, capability-grant review evidence, and any approved exception for telemetry-facing or private-data exposure.
> - `_run_records/TASK_RUN_*.md` records the TASK execution, sources consulted, outputs, QA checks, and warnings.
> - `_STATUS.md` records the safe lifecycle update when the current state permits it.

- **VER-001** — Validate the contracts and review source parity, extension-point and permission boundaries, no-bypass behavior, structured diagnostics, private-data controls, and absence of protected content or authority expansion.

### CLM-026 — Guidance: Plugin and Extension Domain Contracts

> #### Guidance: Plugin and Extension Domain Contracts
>

### CLM-027 — Purpose

> ##### Purpose
>
> DEL-02-04 exists so OpenPipeStress can be extensible without turning plugins or adapters into an escape route around the domain model, unit system, provenance model, diagnostics, report controls, or public/private data boundary. This is the PKG-02 domain/API contract for that boundary, not a plugin-loader implementation. SourcePath: `_CONTEXT.md`; SectionRef: Description. SourcePath: `docs/_Registers/ScopeLedger.csv`; SectionRef: SOW-038.
>

### CLM-028 — Principles

> ##### Principles
>
> 1. Deny-bypass is the governing principle. Plugins/adapters may extend behavior only through governed interfaces that preserve validation, diagnostics, envelopes, and report controls. SourcePath: `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md`; SectionRef: AB-00-02 and AB-00-07.
> 2. Schema-first boundaries should be preferred for public manifests and interchange surfaces because SCA-001 selected JSON Schema 2020-12 and schema-first command/query/job/result envelopes. SourcePath: `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md`; SectionRef: 8.2 Resolved architecture baseline.
> 3. Unit and provenance checks are not optional plugin features. They are part of the core data contract and must be preserved across imports, exports, reports, and rule-facing hooks. SourcePath: `docs/CONTRACT.md`; SectionRef: OPS-K-UNIT-1 and OPS-K-DATA-3.
> 4. Private or protected data must remain under user control. Public artifacts can provide schemas, empty templates, invented examples, and import mechanisms, but must not embed protected standards or proprietary data. SourcePath: `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md`; SectionRef: 2. Public repository may contain and 3. Public repository must not contain.
> 5. Diagnostics should be machine-readable as well as user-visible. Plugin/adapter failures need enough source, affected-object, remediation, and provenance detail to support audit and review. SourcePath: `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md`; SectionRef: AB-00-06.
> 6. Software may show computed states and user-rule outcomes, but it must not claim professional approval or code compliance. SourcePath: `docs/TYPES.md`; SectionRef: 4. Analysis-status vocabulary. SourcePath: `docs/CONTRACT.md`; SectionRef: OPS-K-AUTH-1.
>

### CLM-029 — Considerations

> ##### Considerations
>
> - Keep DEL-02-04 at the domain/API level. Public API transport, concrete import/export formats, concrete plugin loader behavior, and packaging/distribution are later implementation decisions unless separately authorized. SourcePath: `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md`; SectionRef: OI-004 and DEC-012.
> - Treat plugin capability grants as explicit and minimal. ASSUMPTION: a future permission model will need to distinguish read-only project access, governed project mutation, private-library access, filesystem path access, network access, report/export generation, background job execution, and rule-pack evaluator integration. Exact permission names and enforcement technology are TBD.
> - Treat candidate extension point families as rationale-backed assumptions, not an approved registry. Import/export adapter candidates trace to the public API/import-export scope; report/output extension candidates trace to report-control obligations; validation-hook candidates trace to layered testing and protected-content/provenance gates; rule-pack integration hook candidates trace to sandboxed, unit-aware rule evaluation. Exact registry names, registry owner, and approval record are TBD.
> - Prefer private-by-default behavior for user rule packs, component libraries, material data, project files, and calculation results. SourcePath: `docs/PRD.md`; SectionRef: 18.1 Local-First Design and 18.2 Telemetry.
> - When a plugin imports external values, the contract should require provenance and redistribution metadata before those values can become public or reusable. Missing provenance should produce `PROVENANCE_WARNING` or a blocking result when required for reliance. SourcePath: `docs/SPEC.md`; SectionRef: 7. GUI requirements warning classes; SourcePath: `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md`; SectionRef: 4. Required provenance fields.
> - If a plugin touches rule-pack evaluation, it should not run arbitrary executable code. Keep that work declarative, sandboxed, deterministic, unit-aware, and aligned with the rule-pack engine scope. SourcePath: `docs/PRD.md`; SectionRef: 12.3 Rule-Pack Evaluator.
> - If a plugin hashes a JSON manifest or JSON data payload for reproducibility, use the accepted canonical JSON/JCS-compatible hash basis. SourcePath: `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md`; SectionRef: 8.2 Resolved architecture baseline.

### CLM-030 — Trade-offs

> ##### Trade-offs
>
> | Trade-off | Guidance |
> |---|---|
> | Extensibility vs. governance | Prefer stricter validation and explicit diagnostics over broad plugin authority. SOW-038 requires extensibility without bypass. |
> | Schema-first contracts vs. idiomatic in-process APIs | Keep the public/domain contract schema-first where possible; implementation bindings can be generated or wrapped later. Exact code-generation tooling is TBD. |
> | Sandboxing strength vs. plugin ergonomics | Start from least privilege and grant capabilities only when evidence, user intent, and review controls are clear. Exact sandbox mechanism is TBD. |
> | Import/export flexibility vs. data boundary protection | Support adapters, but require provenance, redistribution status, unit checks, and protected-content gates before data leaves private control. |
> | Report customization vs. protected content risk | Allow private report templates under user responsibility, but public templates and exports must not reproduce protected standards or proprietary formulas. |
> | Plugin diagnostics volume vs. auditability | Favor structured diagnostics with source and remediation over terse failures; diagnostics are part of reproducibility and review. |
>

### CLM-031 — Open Decision Table (for human ruling)

> ##### Open Decision Table (for human ruling)
>
> | Decision ID | Decision needed | Current bounded position | Source basis | Human ruling |
> |---|---|---|---|---|
> | OD-02-04-001 | Public API transport for plugin/adapter interfaces | TBD; keep schema-first envelope baseline only | `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` 8.2 Resolved architecture baseline; DEC-012 | TBD |
> | OD-02-04-002 | Approved extension-point registry names and owner | TBD; candidate families remain ASSUMPTION | `docs/_Registers/ScopeLedger.csv` row SOW-038; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` AB-00-07 | TBD |
> | OD-02-04-003 | Permission taxonomy, sandbox mechanism, and approval path | TBD; deny-by-default and no-bypass controls remain governing | `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` AB-00-07 and DEC-012; `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-RULE-2 | TBD |
> | OD-02-04-004 | Supported import/export formats | TBD; do not imply concrete format support | `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` OI-004 and DEC-012 | TBD |
> | OD-02-04-005 | Whether plugins can ever receive telemetry-facing or private engineering data | TBD; default is no telemetry/private-data exposure | `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-PRIV-1 and OPS-K-PRIV-2; `docs/PRD.md` 18.2 Telemetry | TBD |
>

### CLM-032 — Examples

> ##### Examples
>
> The examples below are invented contract scenarios only. They do not define concrete schema syntax or provide engineering values.
>
> | Scenario | Expected contract behavior |
> |---|---|
> | Invented CSV import adapter reads user-supplied component metadata from a private path. | Adapter declares private data access, maps fields to canonical schema, requires units for dimensional values, records source/provenance, and emits diagnostics for missing source/license fields. |
> | Invented result exporter writes a machine-readable result package. | Exporter receives data through a governed query/result envelope, preserves units, includes warnings/assumptions, and does not claim code compliance or professional approval. |
> | Invented rule-pack helper provides a custom interpolation table using user-owned values. | Helper remains sandboxed and deterministic, records redistribution status, rejects missing units, and does not access filesystem or network except through a granted, reviewed capability. |
> | Invented report extension tries to include copied standards text. | Protected-content gate blocks the public artifact, classifies the issue for quarantine/human review, and emits an `IP_BOUNDARY_WARNING`. |
>

### CLM-033 — Conflict Table (for human ruling)

> ##### Conflict Table (for human ruling)
>
> No technical source conflict was identified for plugin-contract content during Pass 3. One metadata traceability conflict remains outside this run's write scope.
>
> | Conflict ID | Conflict (short statement) | Source A (file + section) | Source B (file + section) | Impacted sections | Proposed authority (PROPOSAL) | Human ruling (TBD) |
> |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> | CONF-02-04-001 | Decomposition revision wording differs between current context and local reference index. | `_CONTEXT.md` - Decomposition Reference identifies accepted revision 0.7/current_basis. | `_REFERENCES.md` - Decomposition and Registers describes the decomposition as accepted v0.2. | Datasheet References; future metadata/reference cleanup. | Treat `_CONTEXT.md` and current `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` revision 0.7 as the active basis for this run; route `_REFERENCES.md` cleanup to a later authorized metadata/reference pass. | TBD |
