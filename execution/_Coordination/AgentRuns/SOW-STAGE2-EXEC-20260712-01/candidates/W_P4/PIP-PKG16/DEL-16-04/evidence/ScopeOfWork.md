##### Conditions

| Condition | Status |
|---|---|
| This deliverable does not authorize hidden model mutation or autonomous engineering acceptance. | FACT: PKG-16 package exclusion in `_CONTEXT.md` and `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` section 6. |
| Agent output cannot become accepted engineering work by itself. | FACT: `_CONTEXT.md` Context Envelope Notes and Context Budget QA note. |
| Human acceptance, if represented, is external, human-actor-owned, and bound to reviewed evidence hashes. | FACT: `docs/SPEC.md` sections 4.3 and 9. |
| Current rationale implementation path is established for this slice. | FACT: `core/model_operations/agent_rationale/engine.py` provides `record_agent_rationale()` and `canonical_json()` for DEL-16-04 rationale records. |
| Current focused guard-test path is established for this slice. | FACT: `tests/test_agent_rationale_boundary.py` covers deterministic rationale records, decision-support posture, no accepted-state mutation, visible TBD diagnostics, unresolved assumptions, prohibited-claim blocking, copied-context scanning, enum-style authority tokens, and lowercase approved coordination-context false-positive behavior. |

##### Construction

| Construct | Conservative Definition |
|---|---|
| Agent rationale record | Current Python implementation builds deterministic DEL-16-04 rationale records from DEL-16-01 operation envelopes plus optional audit trail, validation context, source, actor, rationale text, assumptions, affected references, audit references, timestamp, and accepted-state input. It records rationale as decision-support metadata only and computes stable rationale ID/hash values. Standalone rationale schema remains TBD. |
| Professional-boundary controls | Current implementation sets explicit professional-boundary booleans, prevents rationale from creating accepted operation records, mutating accepted model state, or bypassing user acceptance, and emits blocking diagnostics for prohibited authority claims in rationale or copied operation/audit/validation context. Final UI/API/report presentation remains TBD. |
| Guard tests | Current focused test harness is `tests/test_agent_rationale_boundary.py`; adjacent evidence includes `tests/test_operation_audit_trail.py`, `tests/test_operation_validation_preview.py`, and `tests/test_model_operation_schema.py`. Broader persistence/application behavior remains TBD. |
| Dependency evidence surface | `Dependencies.csv` is an approved DAG-006 mirror with ACTIVE upstream rows for architecture-basis deliverables, professional responsibility policy, user acceptance/audit trail, and security threat model. The mirror is not rewritten by this setup pass. |

### CLM-008 — Scope

##### Scope

This deliverable covers the security-control specification surface for recording agent rationale and unresolved assumptions while preserving the professional boundary. It is scoped to DEL-16-04 in PKG-16 and SOW-070.

Included:

- rationale and assumption recording expectations for accepted model operations;
- professional-boundary controls that prevent agent/software claims of certification, approval, authentication, sealing, professional reliance, or code compliance;
- guard-test expectations for that boundary.

Excluded:

- implementation of model-operation schemas owned by DEL-16-01;
- implementation of validation/diff preview owned by DEL-16-02;
- implementation of user acceptance and operation audit trail owned by DEL-16-03;
- professional responsibility/product-claims policy authorship owned by DEL-01-04;
- standalone rationale JSON Schema, final UI/agent workflow presentation, broader persistence/application-service behavior outside this slice, dependency versions, and human review dispositions, which remain TBD unless assigned by later Type 2 work or human ruling.

Current implementation evidence for this deliverable-local slice is `core/model_operations/agent_rationale/engine.py` with focused tests in `tests/test_agent_rationale_boundary.py`. That implementation consumes DEL-16-01 operation envelopes and optional DEL-16-03 audit / DEL-16-02 validation context as read-only rationale context; it does not implement those sibling deliverables.

| REQ-16-04-08 | Public artifacts shall not introduce protected standards text, code-specific values, proprietary data, private project data, or private rule-pack payloads. | `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md` sections 2-6; `docs/CONTRACT.md` section 1, OPS-K-IP-1 through OPS-K-IP-3 | Protected-content and data-boundary review; exact linter integration TBD. |
| REQ-16-04-09 | Plugin, adapter, persistence, report, and application-service paths that touch this control surface shall preserve schema validation, provenance, private-data, protected-content, diagnostics, hashes, and professional-boundary checks. | `docs/SPEC.md` sections 4.4 and 4.5 | Rationale implementation path is established for this slice; plugin, adapter, persistence, report, and broader application-service integration remain TBD until concrete paths are assigned. |
| REQ-16-04-10 | Guard tests shall cover both positive preservation of rationale/assumptions and negative blocking of professional/code-compliance claim language. | `_CONTEXT.md` Anticipated Artifacts; `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-AUTH-1 and OPS-K-AGENT-4 | Current focused guard tests exist in `tests/test_agent_rationale_boundary.py`; broader UI/API/report coverage remains TBD. |

##### Verification

| Verification Item | Method | Acceptance Signal |
|---|---|---|
| Scope conformance | Review against `_CONTEXT.md`, Deliverables register row, and decomposition DEL-16-04 row. | No scope expansion beyond agent rationale and professional-boundary controls. |
| Rationale and assumption preservation | Focused test review of `tests/test_agent_rationale_boundary.py` and implementation review of `core/model_operations/agent_rationale/engine.py`. | Operation-related rationale, unresolved assumptions, affected entities, validation context, audit references, and audit metadata are retained or explicitly marked TBD. |
| Prohibited claim prevention | Focused guard tests for rationale text and copied operation/audit/validation context; future UI/API/report guard coverage remains TBD. | Prohibited authority language yields blocking diagnostics and does not become a permitted rationale status. |
| Human acceptance separation | Review current rationale flags and adjacent audit-trail tests. | Rationale output is decision-support only and does not create accepted operation records, bypass user acceptance, or mutate accepted model state; final human-disposition workflow remains TBD. |
| Protected-content/data boundary | Protected-content and private-data checks. | No protected standards content or private project/rule data added to public artifacts. |
| Dependency preservation | Check approved DAG-006 local mirror. | Existing approved rows remain ACTIVE unless later changed by RECONCILIATION plus CHANGE approval. |

Current authority is `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` revision 0.8, approved `execution/_DAG/DAG-007/` graph context, and D-41/`DEC-074` through the completed T1-T6 bounded records. The implemented working-tree slice and its evidence supersede this surface's setup-only, future-only, or overtaken TBD wording as a current declaration; that earlier wording remains historical setup context only.

Surviving deliverable-local residuals and gates are those recorded in `_STATUS.md ## Remaining`; dated MEMORY and formal-review history remain unchanged. This refresh does not imply lifecycle, review, validation, release, professional-reliance, or code-compliance closure.

### CLM-017 — Steps

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Procedure.md","line_end":44,"line_start":30,"source_sha256":"ce54f371b9d99214f2b673773383384915e66ae24e931ab5391d2bd2d4e2e5d3","target_id":"CLM-017"} -->
##### Steps

1. Confirm the work is still bounded to DEL-16-04 and SOW-070.
2. Review source authority in this order: `_REFERENCES.md` listed governing sources, `_CONTEXT.md`, approved local `Dependencies.csv`, and `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md`.
3. Identify the rationale-record categories supported by sources and implementation: operation history/context, rationale, assumptions, affected entities, audit metadata/references, validation context, source/actor metadata, diagnostics, provenance, and stable rationale ID/hash.
4. Confirm the record posture remains decision-support only: no accepted operation record creation, no accepted-model-state mutation, no user-acceptance bypass, and explicit human-review requirement.
5. Mark unsupported schema fields, standalone schema path, persistence path, UI/agent workflow presentation, broader application behavior, and human dispositions as `TBD` rather than inventing them.
6. Identify prohibited professional-boundary outputs from `docs/CONTRACT.md`, `docs/TYPES.md`, `docs/SPEC.md`, and `PROHIBITED_CLAIM_PATTERNS` in `core/model_operations/agent_rationale/engine.py`.
7. Check that rationale text and copied operation/audit/validation/source/actor/reference context produce blocking diagnostics for prohibited authority language.
8. Check that lowercase coordination references such as approved DAG authority are not misclassified as professional approval unless they use blocked authority language.
9. Check that assumptions, warnings, limitations, missing context, and `TBD` values remain explicit findings.
10. Check that no protected standards text, code-specific values, private project data, or private rule-pack payloads are introduced.
11. Check dependency handling against the local DAG-006 mirror; do not retire, delete, or reclassify approved ACTIVE rows during this setup pass.
12. Record unresolved issues as `TBD`, `ASSUMPTION`, or `PROPOSAL` using `docs/TYPES.md` epistemic labels.

| Rationale preservation check | Operation history, rationale, assumptions, affected entities, and audit metadata are present as required categories or explicitly marked TBD pending schema work. |
| Non-acceptance check | Current rationale output is decision-support only and does not create accepted operation records, bypass user acceptance, or mutate accepted model state. |
| Prohibited-claim check | Automatic output cannot state or imply certification, sealing, approval, authentication, professional reliance, external validation authority, autonomous engineering acceptance, or code compliance. |
| Status-vocabulary check | Automatic statuses remain within the permitted vocabulary from `docs/TYPES.md` and `docs/SPEC.md`. |
| Human-acceptance check | Any human acceptance reference is external, human-actor-owned, and hash-bound; it is not generated by software. |
| Copied-context check | Prohibited authority language in copied operation, audit, or validation context is blocked before rationale is treated as captured for user review. |
| Visible-TBD check | Missing audit context, validation context, source metadata, actor metadata, rationale text, and timestamp remain visible `TBD_VISIBLE` diagnostics. |
| Data-boundary check | No protected standards text, proprietary data, private project data, or private rule-pack payload is introduced. |
| Dependency preservation check | `Dependencies.csv` approved DAG-006 rows remain ACTIVE and unchanged by this setup pass. |

### CLM-019 — Records

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Procedure.md","line_end":68,"line_start":60,"source_sha256":"ce54f371b9d99214f2b673773383384915e66ae24e931ab5391d2bd2d4e2e5d3","target_id":"CLM-019"} -->
##### Records

The expected records for this deliverable are:

- agent rationale record: current implementation path `core/model_operations/agent_rationale/engine.py`; standalone schema and persistence path TBD;
- professional-boundary guard tests: current focused path `tests/test_agent_rationale_boundary.py`; broader UI/API/report coverage TBD;
- unresolved assumptions and `TBD` decisions surfaced in deliverable documents;
- validation evidence from focused implementation tests;
- this setup document kit and semantic/lensing metadata.
<!-- sow-source-end -->

- **VER-001** — Validate the contract and review source parity, rationale/audit/validation/source/actor context preservation, deterministic identity, visible TBD and unresolved-assumption behavior, all prohibited-claim and copied-context guards including false-positive boundaries, external human-owned acceptance separation, no application or state mutation, protected-data posture, retained downstream TBDs, and absence of autonomous acceptance or professional-authority claims.

## Governing Values and Decisions — Axiology

### CLM-020 — Guidance: DEL-16-04 Agent rationale and professional-boundary controls

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":2,"line_start":1,"source_sha256":"4e45ad92490c47ec4a7407e53ace2fc6ef5fda03a8592ced3c9a03780938621e","target_id":"CLM-020"} -->
#### Guidance: DEL-16-04 Agent rationale and professional-boundary controls

<!-- sow-source-end -->

### CLM-021 — Purpose

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":6,"line_start":3,"source_sha256":"4e45ad92490c47ec4a7407e53ace2fc6ef5fda03a8592ced3c9a03780938621e","target_id":"CLM-021"} -->
##### Purpose

This deliverable exists to keep agent-assisted model operation workflows auditable without allowing agent output to become accepted engineering work by itself. The source basis is DEL-16-04, SOW-070, OBJ-015, OBJ-018, and the project authority boundaries in `docs/CONTRACT.md`, `docs/TYPES.md`, and `docs/SPEC.md`.

### CLM-022 — Principles

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":18,"line_start":7,"source_sha256":"4e45ad92490c47ec4a7407e53ace2fc6ef5fda03a8592ced3c9a03780938621e","target_id":"CLM-022"} -->
##### Principles

| Principle | Guidance | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Proposal is not acceptance | Treat agent rationale as proposal/supporting explanation until a human gate accepts the related work. | `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-AGENT-4; `docs/AGENTIC_DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` section 1 |
| Preserve rationale and assumptions | Do not collapse rationale, unresolved assumptions, affected entities, and audit metadata into unstructured text that cannot support reproducible review. | `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` SOW-070 |
| Block professional claims | Controls should prevent certification, approval, sealing, authentication, professional reliance, and code-compliance claim language from being generated as software/agent authority. | `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-AUTH-1; `docs/TYPES.md` section 4 |
| Surface unknowns | Missing or unsupported facts should remain `TBD` or explicit assumptions rather than silent defaults. | `docs/DIRECTIVE.md` section 2.4; `docs/SPEC.md` section 12 |
| Keep protected data out | Rationale and tests must not quote or paraphrase protected standards content, proprietary data, private project data, or private rule-pack payloads into public artifacts. | `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md` sections 2-6 |
| Preserve hash-bound human authority | If human acceptance records are referenced, treat them as external, human-owned, and bound to reviewed payload hashes. | `docs/SPEC.md` sections 4.3 and 9 |
| Keep rationale non-applying | Treat `record_agent_rationale()` output as deterministic decision-support metadata only; it must not create accepted operation records, mutate accepted model state, or bypass user acceptance. | `core/model_operations/agent_rationale/engine.py`; `tests/test_agent_rationale_boundary.py` |

### CLM-023 — Considerations

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":29,"line_start":19,"source_sha256":"4e45ad92490c47ec4a7407e53ace2fc6ef5fda03a8592ced3c9a03780938621e","target_id":"CLM-023"} -->
##### Considerations

| Topic | Consideration |
|---|---|
| Record shape | The current Python record shape is established in `core/model_operations/agent_rationale/engine.py` for this slice: deliverable/package/scope metadata, operation set ref, audit context, source, actor, timestamp, rationale posture, assumptions, validation context, affected entities, audit references, operation context, diagnostics, accepted-state unchanged flag, professional boundary, provenance, rationale ID, and rationale hash. Standalone JSON Schema and final persistence path remain TBD. |
| Guard-test surface | Current focused guards are in `tests/test_agent_rationale_boundary.py`. They cover deterministic records, no accepted-state mutation, no accepted-operation creation, no user-acceptance bypass, missing-context/TBD visibility, unresolved assumptions, prohibited rationale claims, copied-context claims, enum-style authority tokens, and lowercase approved coordination-context false-positive behavior. Broader UI/API/report coverage remains TBD. |
| Dependency context | The approved DAG-006 mirror identifies architecture-basis deliverables, professional responsibility policy, user acceptance/audit trail, and security threat model as upstream context. This setup pass preserves that mirror rather than reclassifying it. |
| Rationale privacy | Rationale may mention project context or user inputs. Future implementation must respect private-data and protected-content controls before public export. |
| Human review | Human review is a boundary, not a wording detail. A UI label or report phrase must not imply human acceptance unless backed by an external, human-owned, hash-bound record. |
| Copied context | Rationale capture scans rationale text plus copied operation, audit, validation, source, actor, affected-reference, and audit-reference context for prohibited authority language. Blocking diagnostics should be treated as wording/authority blockers, not engineering findings. |

### CLM-024 — Trade-offs

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":38,"line_start":30,"source_sha256":"4e45ad92490c47ec4a7407e53ace2fc6ef5fda03a8592ced3c9a03780938621e","target_id":"CLM-024"} -->
##### Trade-offs

| Trade-off | Conservative Direction |
|---|---|
| Detailed rationale vs. private-data exposure | Preserve enough rationale for reproducible model-state review, but redact or keep private any protected, proprietary, or project-private content. |
| Strict prohibited-claim filters vs. false positives | Prefer blocking or flagging ambiguous professional/code-compliance language until a human resolves the wording. |
| Flexible notes vs. structured review | Allow notes only when structured fields preserve operation history, assumptions, affected entities, audit metadata, and review status. |
| Human acceptance references vs. software statuses | Keep human acceptance external and hash-bound; do not convert it into an automatic software status. |

### CLM-025 — Examples

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":52,"line_start":39,"source_sha256":"4e45ad92490c47ec4a7407e53ace2fc6ef5fda03a8592ced3c9a03780938621e","target_id":"CLM-025"} -->
##### Examples

Source-backed vocabulary examples:

| Category | Examples from Sources |
|---|---|
| Permitted automatic software statuses | `MODEL_INCOMPLETE`, `MECHANICS_SOLVED`, `RULE_INPUTS_INCOMPLETE`, `USER_RULE_CHECKED`, `USER_RULE_FAILED`, `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED` (`docs/TYPES.md` section 4). |
| Prohibited automatic status or claim language | `HUMAN_APPROVED_FOR_PROJECT`, `CODE_COMPLIANT`, `CERTIFIED`, `SEALED`, `APPROVED`, or equivalent professional/code-compliance language (`docs/TYPES.md` section 4). |
| Required epistemic labels | `FACT`, `ASSUMPTION`, `PROPOSAL`, `TBD` (`docs/TYPES.md` section 5). |
| Current rationale blocking diagnostics | `RATIONALE-AUTHORITY-COMPLIANCE-BLOCKED`, `RATIONALE-AUTHORITY-CERTIFICATION-BLOCKED`, `RATIONALE-AUTHORITY-SEALING-BLOCKED`, `RATIONALE-AUTHORITY-AUTHENTICATION-BLOCKED`, `RATIONALE-AUTHORITY-PROFESSIONAL-APPROVAL-BLOCKED`, `RATIONALE-AUTHORITY-EXTERNAL-VALIDATION-BLOCKED`, and `RATIONALE-AUTHORITY-AUTONOMOUS-ACCEPTANCE-BLOCKED` from `core/model_operations/agent_rationale/engine.py`. |
| Current visible TBD diagnostics | Missing audit context, validation context, source metadata, actor metadata, rationale text, and timestamp are emitted as `TBD_VISIBLE` diagnostics in `record_agent_rationale()`. |

The authorized implementation/test evidence uses invented fixtures only. No project-specific engineering example, standards clause, acceptance value, or professional/code-compliance conclusion is established by this slice.
