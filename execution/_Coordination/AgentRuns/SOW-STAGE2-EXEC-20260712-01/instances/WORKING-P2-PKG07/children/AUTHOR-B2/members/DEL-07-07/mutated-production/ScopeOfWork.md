# Scope of Work — DEL-07-07

## Purpose and Objective Traceability

This Scope of Work defines `DEL-07-07` in service of project scope [SOW-055] and package objectives [OBJ-006, OBJ-007].

- **OUT-001** — A solve-execution UX contract covering background job launch, service-reported progress, cancellation requests and terminal states, diagnostics, blocked-state separation, reproducibility signals, and professional-review boundaries is produced.

### CLM-004 — Attributes

> ##### Attributes
>
> | Attribute | Setup value |
> |---|---|
> | UX surface | Solve run panel, progress/cancel controls, diagnostic presentation |
> | Execution mode | Background solve execution through application-service command/job boundaries |
> | Progress basis | Report only progress states, phases, or measures supplied by the job contract; exact progress semantics remain TBD |
> | Cancellation basis | User cancellation is routed through the application-service job cancellation contract; direct GUI bypass of solver state is out of scope |
> | Diagnostics basis | Diagnostic/result-envelope contract from PKG-00, including code, class, severity, source, affected object, message, remediation, and provenance where available |
> | Result review basis | Mechanics solve status, missing data, assumptions, diagnostics, and reproducibility signals remain visible for professional review |
> | Implementation status | No GUI source code, tests, schemas, job code, or solver code is implemented by this setup run |
>

### CLM-005 — Conditions

> ##### Conditions
>
> | Condition | Treatment |
> |---|---|
> | Missing solve-required inputs | Presented as `SOLVE_BLOCKING` diagnostics or equivalent envelope entries; never silently defaulted |
> | Missing rule-check inputs | Presented separately from solve readiness as `RULE_CHECK_BLOCKING` or equivalent diagnostics |
> | Nonlinear or numerical uncertainty | Presented as solver diagnostics and warning classes rather than hidden state |
> | Protected standards/code data | Not introduced; any code-specific or proprietary data remains user-supplied/private |
> | Professional reliance | Human review remains required; the GUI shall not claim certification, approval, sealing, or code compliance |
> | Reproducibility | Run records should preserve model/version/hash/checksum inputs when provided by upstream contracts; exact fields remain TBD |
>

### CLM-006 — Construction

> ##### Construction
>
> This setup constructs only deliverable-local planning artifacts:
>
> - `Datasheet.md`
> - `Specification.md`
> - `Guidance.md`
> - `Procedure.md`
> - `_SEMANTIC.md`
> - `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md`
> - `Dependencies.csv`
> - `_DEPENDENCIES.md`
> - `_run_records/*`
> - `_STATUS.md`
>
> Future implementation work must remain bounded by the GUI/application-service seam defined by PKG-00. It should consume command/job/progress/cancellation and diagnostics/result-envelope contracts rather than inventing GUI-owned solver semantics.

### CLM-015 — Acceptance Notes

> ##### Acceptance Notes
>
> `SEMANTIC_READY` means the setup artifacts are prepared for review. It does not mean product implementation is complete, UI behavior is tested, solver behavior is verified, protected data is authorized, code compliance is established, or professional approval has occurred.

### CLM-016 — D-41 R5 T5 PDU-008 current GUI boundary

> ##### D-41 R5 T5 PDU-008 current GUI boundary
>
> The desktop diagnostic type/detail/filter path preserves class, remediation, and provenance when supplied and labels their absence as producer-unsupplied. Producer-side reduced shapes remain open; the GUI does not fabricate missing metadata.

- **AC-001** — The contract preserves service-owned progress and cancellation semantics, complete diagnostic fields and warning classes, separate solve and rule-check readiness, reproducibility traceability, and no invented progress, silent defaults, compliance status, or professional approval.

>

### CLM-027 — Purpose

> ##### Purpose
>
> This deliverable keeps solve execution reviewable from the GUI without moving solver authority into the GUI. The user should be able to see that a solve is running, what the service reports about its progress, whether cancellation was requested or completed, and which diagnostics qualify the result.
>
> The setup is intentionally contract-facing. It prepares a future GUI slice to consume application-service jobs and diagnostics/result envelopes while preserving missing-data, provenance, unit, privacy, and professional-responsibility boundaries.
>

### CLM-028 — Principles

> ##### Principles
>
> | Principle | Guidance |
> |---|---|
> | Service boundary first | GUI components initiate commands/jobs and observe job/envelope state. They do not own solver lifecycle semantics. |
> | Report what is supplied | Progress should reflect service-provided phases, counts, statuses, or messages. If only indeterminate progress is available, the UI should show indeterminate progress rather than fabricate precision. |
> | Cancellation is a request | Cancellation UX should distinguish requested, accepted, completed, failed, and not-supported states only when the service contract supplies those states. Exact enum names remain `TBD`. |
> | Diagnostics stay attached | Warnings and errors should remain linked to the run, affected object, source, severity, and remediation fields where available. |
> | Missing data is visible | Solve-blocking, rule-check-blocking, provenance, assumption, nonlinear, and IP-boundary warnings should remain visible instead of becoming generic failure messages. |
> | Professional boundary remains visible | A completed mechanics solve is not a code-compliance certificate. Human review remains required for professional reliance. |
>

### CLM-029 — Considerations

> ##### Considerations
>
> Background solves often have phases that are meaningful to users even when exact completion percentages are not reliable. A future UI can show service-reported states such as queued, validating, solving, recovering results, checking user rules, writing report/export artifacts, canceled, failed, or complete only if those states are supplied by the job contract. These labels are examples of UX categories, not fixed contract enums.
>
> Cancellation should preserve auditability. A canceled run may still produce diagnostics, partial records, or a terminal envelope explaining what was stopped and what was not computed. The GUI should present that terminal envelope rather than removing the run from view.
>
> Diagnostic presentation should support both quick triage and detailed review. A user needs to know which diagnostics block solving, which block only rule checks, which are provenance or assumption warnings, and which reflect nonlinear/numerical uncertainty. The future UI should keep diagnostic class and severity visible without converting warnings into professional judgments.
>
> Result/export readiness should be traceable. Where upstream contracts supply hashes, solver versions, model versions, rule-pack checksums, warning sets, and limitations, the solve UX should preserve those signals for reports and result exports. Where those fields are missing, the setup should mark them `TBD` rather than inventing them.
>

### CLM-030 — Trade-offs

> ##### Trade-offs
>
> | Decision area | Recommended posture | Risk if ignored |
> |---|---|---|
> | Percent progress | Prefer contract-supplied percentages; otherwise use indeterminate or phase-based progress | False precision can mislead users and reviewers |
> | Cancellation feedback | Show request and final job state separately | Users may believe a solve stopped cleanly when the service did not confirm it |
> | Diagnostic density | Provide summary and detail surfaces | Hiding details weakens reviewability; flooding the main surface weakens usability |
> | Result status wording | Use mechanics/rule/human-review status vocabulary | Users may infer code compliance or professional approval from software output |
> | Error recovery | Preserve terminal envelopes and run records | Failed/canceled solves become unreviewable |
>

### CLM-031 — Examples

> ##### Examples
>
> The following are non-normative UX examples only:
>
> - If the job contract supplies no percentage, show an indeterminate progress indicator plus the current service-reported phase.
> - If cancellation is requested, disable duplicate cancel requests while continuing to display diagnostics and the final terminal envelope when received.
> - If a solve completes but rule-pack inputs are missing, present the mechanics result separately from the rule-check-blocking diagnostics.
> - If a nonlinear warning is returned, keep it visible with the affected object and remediation text supplied by the diagnostic record.
>

### CLM-032 — Open Issues

> ##### Open Issues
>
> | ID | Issue | Owner |
> |---|---|---|
