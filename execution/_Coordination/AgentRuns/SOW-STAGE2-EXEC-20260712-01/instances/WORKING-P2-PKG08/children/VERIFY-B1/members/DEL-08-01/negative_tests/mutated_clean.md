# Scope of Work — DEL-08-01

## Purpose and Objective Traceability

This Scope of Work defines `DEL-08-01` in service of project scope [SOW-024] and package objectives [OBJ-007].

- **OUT-001** — A calculation-report generation contract covering auditable input, source, result, warning, assumption, limitation, unit, provenance, rule-pack, and reproducibility content is produced without claiming certification or professional approval.

### CLM-004 — Attributes

> ##### Attributes
>
> | Attribute | Source-grounded value |
> |---|---|
> | Production family | Calculation reports for OpenPipeStress analysis outputs. |
> | Required report content | Inputs, sources, warnings, assumptions, results, rule-pack checksums, and limitations. |
> | Anticipated downstream artifacts | Report renderer, report template, tests. |
> | Setup-session implementation boundary | Renderer source, templates outside this deliverable, tests, schemas, and repo-level artifacts are out of write scope. |
> | Architecture baseline | Rust core/application services, schema-first command/query/job/result envelopes, JSON Schema 2020-12 contracts, canonical JSON/JCS-compatible hash basis where JSON payload hashes are used. |
> | Report authority boundary | Reports are decision-support artifacts and must not claim certification, sealing, approval, authentication, or automatic code compliance. |
> | Protected-content boundary | Public templates/examples must not reproduce protected standards text, protected standards tables, protected figures, proprietary formulas, or protected code-derived content. |
>

### CLM-005 — Conditions

> ##### Conditions
>
> | Condition | Handling requirement |
> |---|---|
> | Missing solve-required data | Preserve as explicit diagnostics or report findings; do not hide with silent defaults. |
> | Missing rule-check-required data | Preserve as explicit rule-check-blocking diagnostics or findings; do not imply a completed check. |
> | User-supplied code data | Record as user-supplied or private/provenance-tagged data; do not convert it into public defaults. |
> | Rule-pack references | Report only identity, version, checksum, source/provenance notices, redistribution status, and user-provided report notices; do not reproduce protected rule text. |
> | Professional reliance | Include a notice that competent human review is required before project reliance. |
> | Unit-bearing values | Preserve units and dimensional context in generated report sections. |
> | Private project data | Keep redaction/export handling visible as a requirement and defer detailed controls to PKG-12 where needed. |
>

### CLM-006 — Construction

> ##### Construction
>
> The calculation report generator deliverable is specified here as a bounded backend feature slice, not implemented in this setup session. Its future implementation should assemble report content from schema-first project/model/result envelopes, diagnostics, provenance metadata, and rule-pack references. The report generator must preserve the diagnostic/result-envelope boundary injected by AB-00-03 and AB-00-06: report content reflects mechanics outputs, user-rule-check outputs, warnings, assumptions, and limitations without promoting software output into professional approval.
>
> The setup artifact family prepared for this session is:
>
> - `Datasheet.md`
> - `Specification.md`
> - `Guidance.md`
> - `Procedure.md`
> - `_SEMANTIC.md`
> - `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md`
> - `Dependencies.csv`
> - `_DEPENDENCIES.md`
> - `_run_records/*`
> - `_STATUS.md`

>

### CLM-013 — Verification

> ##### Verification
>
> The future implementation should be accepted only after these checks exist and pass:
>
> - Four-document setup artifacts exist for this deliverable.
> - `Dependencies.csv` is valid v3.1 and every ACTIVE row has evidence.
> - Report fixtures cover mechanics-only, rule-inputs-incomplete, user-rule-checked, warnings-present, and protected-content-risk cases.
> - Report reproducibility tests normalize volatile metadata and verify stable report payloads.
> - Protected-content and prohibited-claim gates scan public report templates/examples.
> - Human review confirms that the report generator does not assert compliance, certification, sealing, or project acceptance.
>

### CLM-014 — Documentation

> ##### Documentation
>
> Required setup documentation for this deliverable:
>
> - `Datasheet.md` records identity, boundaries, conditions, and reference basis.
> - `Specification.md` records requirements and verification targets.
> - `Guidance.md` records rationale, principles, trade-offs, and open questions.
> - `Procedure.md` records execution and future implementation workflow.

>
> - No file outside `execution/PKG-08_Reporting, Audit, and Reproducibility/1_Working/DEL-08-01_Calculation report generator/` is edited.
> - No renderer source, external report template, test, schema, or repo-level artifact is modified.
> - Setup artifacts are source-grounded to local governance, decomposition, register, and context files.
> - No protected standards content or certification/compliance claim is introduced.
> - `_STATUS.md` reports `SEMANTIC_READY` only after the four-document kit, semantic artifacts, dependency register, and validation checks are complete.

- **AC-001** — The contract preserves report content and status boundaries, explicit missing-data and diagnostic findings, units and provenance, safe rule-pack metadata, protected-content limits, reproducibility requirements, and competent-human-review notices without inventing unresolved renderer or schema choices.

>

### CLM-027 — Purpose

> ##### Purpose
>
> The calculation report generator exists to make analysis outputs reviewable and reproducible without converting software output into professional approval. It should help a competent reviewer see what was analyzed, what data was supplied, what assumptions or gaps remain, what warnings were raised, what rule-pack metadata was used, and what limitations apply.
>

### CLM-028 — Principles

> ##### Principles
>
> | Principle | Guidance |
> |---|---|
> | Auditability first | Report content should be traceable to model inputs, result envelopes, diagnostics, provenance records, report settings, and rule-pack references. |
> | Boundary clarity | The report should separate mechanics solve output, user-rule-check output, incomplete inputs, and human review. |
> | No protected content | Public report templates and examples should contain placeholders, invented values, or safe metadata, not protected code text/tables/formulas. |
> | No professional overclaim | Report language should say what the software computed and what data was supplied, not that the work is certified, sealed, approved, or code-compliant for reliance. |
> | Unit visibility | Unit-bearing values should display units and keep dimensional context visible. |
> | Reproducibility | Reports should bind to versions, hashes, manifests, warnings, and rule-pack checksums so reviewers can reproduce or compare results. |
> | Local-first privacy | Private project/rule/material/component data should remain user-controlled unless intentionally exported with documented rights. |
>

### CLM-029 — Considerations

> ##### Considerations
>
> The report generator will depend on upstream model/result/rule-pack envelopes that are not implemented in this setup session. Where the current source set does not provide exact field names, template structure, renderer API, or output format, those details remain `TBD` for future sealed implementation briefs.
>
> The report generator should be conservative about rule-pack content. A report can identify a rule pack, version, checksum, required-input state, source notice, redistribution status, and user-provided notice. It should not copy protected rule text or proprietary formulas into public templates/examples.
>
> The report generator should expose warnings as findings, not as decoration. Missing solve-required values, rule-check-required values, weak provenance, assumptions, nonlinear uncertainty, and IP-boundary concerns should be report-visible when present in the input envelopes.
>

### CLM-030 — Trade-offs

> ##### Trade-offs
>
> | Topic | Conservative direction |
> |---|---|
> | Human-readable PDF/HTML vs structured output | This deliverable can define report assembly behavior, but result export format is a separate DEL-08-04 concern. Avoid binding a public transport/output format here beyond setup requirements. |
> | Rich template language vs protected-content control | Prefer constrained placeholders and safe metadata over a template model that encourages copying protected code text into public examples. |
> | User-private templates vs public templates | User-private templates may contain user-owned content under user responsibility; public templates must stay protected-content-free. |
> | Completion language vs professional boundary | Use "generated", "computed", "reported", "checked by user rule pack" and "human review required"; avoid compliance/certification language. |
>

### CLM-031 — Examples

> ##### Examples
>
> Safe report section labels may include:
>
> - Model input summary
> - Source and provenance summary
> - Load case and combination summary
> - Result summary
> - Warnings and missing data
> - Assumptions and limitations
> - Rule-pack references and checksums
> - Reproducibility manifest
> - Professional review notice
>
> These labels are illustrative only and do not define a renderer template in this setup session.
>

### CLM-032 — Conflict Table (for human ruling)

> ##### Conflict Table (for human ruling)
>
> No source conflicts were identified in the local reference set for this setup run.

> |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> | None | None identified | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
>

### CLM-033 — Open Questions

> ##### Open Questions
>
> | ID | Question | Current disposition |
> |---|---|---|
> | OQ-08-01-001 | Exact renderer library, file format, and report template language. | TBD; outside setup-session write scope. |
> | OQ-08-01-002 | Exact report schema fields and result-envelope field names. | TBD; downstream schema/service deliverables must define before implementation. |
> | OQ-08-01-003 | Redaction/export configuration for private project data in shared reports. | TBD; coordinate with PKG-12 in future sealed work. |
> | OQ-08-01-004 | Human approval workflow and acceptance-record binding to report hashes. | TBD; outside software authority unless human governance defines a record process. |
