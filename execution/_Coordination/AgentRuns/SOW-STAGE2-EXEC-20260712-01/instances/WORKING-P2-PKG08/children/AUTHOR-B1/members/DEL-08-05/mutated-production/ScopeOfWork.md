# Scope of Work — DEL-08-05

## Purpose and Objective Traceability

This Scope of Work defines `DEL-08-05` in service of project scope [SOW-043] and package objectives [OBJ-002, OBJ-007].

- **OUT-001** — A protected-content report-linting contract covering configured public report surfaces, conservative heuristic findings, safe synthetic fixtures, deterministic diagnostics, quarantine and review routing, optional private scanning, and CI integration boundaries is produced.

>

### CLM-004 — Attributes

> ##### Attributes
>
> | Attribute | Value |
> |---|---|
> | Primary purpose | Define setup expectations for checks that prevent public report templates/examples from automatically embedding protected code text, copied standards tables, proprietary formulas, or private/proprietary engineering content. |
> | Public/private boundary | Public templates and examples must stay protected-content-free. User-private report templates remain user responsibility. |
> | Review posture | Heuristic plus review; this linter cannot be the sole legal/IP control. |
> | Anticipated future artifacts | `report linter`; `CI guard` |
> | Authorized current artifacts | Four-document setup kit, semantic artifacts, dependency register, run records, status update. |
> | Explicit exclusions | No linter source, no CI workflow edits, no test fixtures embedding protected examples, no legal-sufficiency claim, no `ISSUED` movement. |
>

### CLM-005 — Conditions

> ##### Conditions
>
> | Condition | SourceRef | Disposition |
> |---|---|---|
> | Public repository must not contain protected standards text, tables, figures, examples, copied code formulas, material allowables, SIF/flexibility tables, protected dimensional tables, or proprietary commercial data. | `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-IP-1; `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md` Section 3 | Binding guardrail for future linter scope. |
> | Suspected protected content must be quarantined and escalated; agents must not paraphrase protected tables into public data. | `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-IP-3; `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md` Section 5 | Linter findings must route to review rather than automatic acceptance. |
> | Public report templates and examples must not reproduce protected standards content. | `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-REPORT-2; `docs/SPEC.md` Section 8 | Direct requirement for this deliverable. |
> | Reports must not claim certification, sealing, approval, authentication, or code compliance for reliance. | `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-AUTH-1; `docs/TYPES.md` Section 4 | Linter scope may include prohibited public-claim language, but human review remains required. |
> | Reports may reference user rule-pack IDs, versions, checksums, and source notes without embedding protected formulas or tables. | `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md` Section 7; `docs/SPEC.md` Sections 6 and 8 | Safe metadata is allowed; rule-pack content remains user/private unless rights are documented. |
> | Telemetry/private data boundaries must be preserved. | `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-PRIV-1; OPS-K-PRIV-2 | Future linter should not transmit or collect private project/rule data. |
>

### CLM-006 — Construction

> ##### Construction
>
> The future linter should be framed as a conservative protected-content and public-report guard. It should inspect only authorized public report-template/example surfaces unless a user explicitly runs it against private material. It should flag suspected protected or private content for human review, not decide legal sufficiency or professional acceptability.
>
> Expected future check categories:
>
> | Category | Intended behavior | Boundary |
> |---|---|---|
> | Protected text/table/formula indicators | Detect likely copied standards/code/vendor content in public templates/examples using heuristic patterns and allowlisted safe placeholders. | No protected examples may be embedded as fixtures. |
> | Public/private marker checks | Require explicit public/private or redistribution-status metadata where template/example content may expose rule-pack or provenance text. | Unknown status is a finding, not a silent pass. |
> | Prohibited public claims | Flag public report language that claims software certification, sealing, approval, authentication, or automatic code compliance. | The check supports OPS-K-AUTH-1 but does not replace human review. |
> | Safe metadata allowance | Permit rule-pack identity, version, checksum, source notice, redistribution status, and user-supplied notices when represented as metadata. | Do not reproduce protected rule formulas or tables in public artifacts. |
> | Review routing | Emit actionable diagnostics such as `IP_BOUNDARY_WARNING` and review-required findings. | Do not auto-quarantine outside future authorized implementation scope. |
>

### CLM-010 — Scope

> ##### Scope
>
> This deliverable specifies setup requirements for a protected-content linter that will guard public report templates and examples against accidental inclusion of protected standards/code text, copied standards tables, proprietary formulas, private rule-pack content, or misleading professional-authority claims.
>
> In scope for future implementation:
>
> - checks over public report templates/examples and other explicitly configured public report surfaces;
> - heuristic detection of protected-content risk categories without embedding protected examples as fixtures;
> - diagnostics that route suspected protected/private content to human review;
> - checks that public report language does not claim software certification, sealing, approval, authentication, or automatic code compliance;
> - CI guard integration when separately authorized by implementation scope.
>
> Out of scope for this setup session:
>
> - writing linter source code;
> - adding or modifying CI guards;
> - adding tests or protected-content fixtures;
> - editing report templates or report generator source;
> - making legal sufficiency, compliance, certification, or professional-reliance claims;
> - moving the deliverable to `ISSUED`.

### CLM-021 — Setup sequence used in this session

> ###### Setup sequence used in this session
>
> 1. Read the sealed context and required governance/decomposition files.
> 2. Run `four-documents` with `RUN_PASSES=P1_P2` by drafting `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, and `Procedure.md` from accessible local sources.
> 3. Run `semantic-matrix-build` by replacing the placeholder `_SEMANTIC.md` with deliverable-bound semantic matrices and recording audit PASS.
> 4. Run `lens-register` by creating `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` with complete matrix-cell coverage.
> 5. Run `four-documents` with `RUN_PASSES=P3_ONLY` by applying warranted lensing findings or recording that no document rewrite was warranted.

>

### CLM-022 — Future implementation procedure

> ###### Future implementation procedure
>
> 1. Confirm authorized scan surfaces.
>    - Enumerate public report template/example paths.

>

### CLM-027 — Purpose

> ##### Purpose
>
> The protected-content linter exists to reduce the risk that public report templates or examples accidentally carry content the OpenPipeStress public repository must not redistribute. It supports the IP/data boundary and reproducible professional review, but it remains a heuristic guard plus review workflow, not a legal opinion or engineering acceptance decision.
>

### CLM-028 — Principles

> ##### Principles
>
> | Principle | Guidance |
> |---|---|
> | Protect public artifacts | Default scanning should target public report templates/examples and configured public report surfaces. |
> | Preserve private responsibility | User-private report templates, licensed standards quotes, owner design bases, and private rule packs remain user responsibility unless the user explicitly opts into local scanning. |
> | Use synthetic fixtures | Future tests should use invented markers and safe placeholders rather than copied standards/code/vendor content. |
> | Flag, do not certify | Findings should route suspected content to quarantine/review. A clean scan should not be described as legally sufficient. |
> | Allow safe metadata | Rule-pack IDs, versions, checksums, source notices, redistribution status, and required-input status can be safe when they do not expose protected content. |
> | Keep professional boundary visible | Public report text should avoid claims of certification, sealing, approval, authentication, or automatic code compliance. |
> | Keep diagnostics reproducible | Finding output should be stable, traceable to files/locations, and suitable for CI and review records. |
>

### CLM-029 — Considerations

> ##### Considerations
>
> The linter cannot know whether every phrase, formula, or table is protected. It should combine conservative heuristic checks, required metadata, safe fixture policy, and human/legal review routing. False positives are acceptable when they protect the public repository boundary; false negatives are a residual risk that review must address.
>
> Public report templates should prefer placeholders, invented values, and metadata references over copied explanatory text or engineering formula bodies. User-private report templates may include licensed or proprietary content under user control, but the public project should not assume those templates are redistributable.
>
> The future implementation should avoid a fixture strategy that recreates the very material it is intended to detect. Synthetic markers, invented table structures, and non-code phrases are preferable to copied source examples.
>

### CLM-030 — Trade-offs

> ##### Trade-offs
>
> | Topic | Conservative direction |
> |---|---|
> | Detection breadth vs false positives | Prefer review-blocking warnings for plausible protected-content risk in public artifacts. |
> | Pattern specificity vs protected fixture risk | Use safe synthetic markers, metadata checks, and structural heuristics instead of copied protected examples. |
> | CI automation vs legal judgment | CI can block or warn based on policy, but legal/provenance disposition remains a human process. |
> | Public template convenience vs IP boundary | Public templates should be sparse and metadata-driven where protected content might otherwise be copied. |
> | User-private template support vs privacy | Local opt-in scanning can help users, but default behavior must not transmit or commit private content. |
>

### CLM-031 — Examples

> ##### Examples
>
> Safe public examples may use:
>
> - invented placeholder notices;
> - synthetic rule-pack IDs and checksums;
> - fake non-code formula markers that are explicitly marked as invented;
> - empty or schematic table headings that do not reproduce protected table content;
> - professional-review notices that describe decision support without claiming approval.
>
> Unsafe public-example patterns include:
>
> - copied standards-body explanatory text;
> - copied standards or vendor tables;
> - copied proprietary formulas or formula commentary;
> - private owner/rule-pack text committed as a public template;
> - report wording that states the software certifies or declares code compliance for reliance.
>
> These examples are categorical only. They intentionally do not include protected source text or copied proprietary values.
