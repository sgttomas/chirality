# Scope of Work — DEL-08-04

## Purpose and Objective Traceability

This Scope of Work defines `DEL-08-04` in service of project scope [SOW-046] and package objectives [OBJ-007, OBJ-009].

- **OUT-001** — A schema-first machine-readable JSON result-envelope contract for review, regression comparison, report generation, GUI consumption, automation, and governed downstream adapters is produced while additional concrete export formats remain TBD.

### CLM-005 — Conditions

> ##### Conditions
>
> - This session is setup/document production only; no schema file, exporter source, tests, docs outside this folder, or repository-level artifacts are modified.
> - The export baseline is a JSON result envelope contract. Any additional export format remains `TBD` until a later bounded decision or implementation brief.
> - Result exports must preserve the PKG-00 no-bypass baseline: adapters and downstream tools cannot bypass unit checks, diagnostics, provenance, public/private data boundaries, or professional-responsibility notices.
> - Mechanics results, user-rule-check results, and human review/approval states must remain distinguishable in exported data.
> - Exported diagnostics must carry enough structured information for review and regression triage without relying on prose-only warnings.
>

### CLM-006 — Construction

> ##### Construction
>
> The future result export contract is expected to include these setup-level components:
>
> | Component | Purpose | Boundary |
> |---|---|---|
> | Result envelope header | Identifies export schema version, result set ID, model/run reference, solver version reference, and creation context. | Does not imply validation, certification, or professional acceptance. |
> | Unit-aware result payloads | Carries displacement, rotation, force, moment, reaction, stress, ratio, or rule-check result values with unit metadata and dimensional categories. | No hidden unit defaults; code-specific values remain user/rule-pack supplied. |
> | Diagnostics block | Carries structured diagnostics with code, class, severity, source, affected object, message, remediation, and provenance. | Diagnostics must not be dropped by exporters or adapters. |
> | Provenance and reproducibility references | Links to model hash, manifest, rule-pack checksum, source/provenance notes, and input/run identifiers where available. | References private data safely; does not copy protected or private payloads into public artifacts. |
> | Analysis status fields | Distinguishes `MECHANICS_SOLVED`, `RULE_INPUTS_INCOMPLETE`, `USER_RULE_CHECKED`, `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED`, and related statuses. | Must not emit automatic `CODE_COMPLIANT` or professional approval status. |
> | Regression comparison surface | Provides stable identifiers, deterministic ordering, and numeric/unit metadata suitable for comparison tests. | Exact comparison tolerances and tooling remain future validation work. |
> | Downstream tooling handoff | Provides a stable machine-readable contract for headless CLI, report generation, GUI results viewer, and adapters. | External transport and concrete non-JSON formats remain `TBD`. |
>

### CLM-012 — Standards

> ##### Standards
>
> | Standard or basis | Applicability | Status |
> |---|---|---|
> | JSON Schema 2020-12 | Baseline schema technology for public result envelope contracts. | Architecture basis; schema file editing is outside this setup write scope. |
> | Schema-first command/query/job result envelope baseline | Result export/API boundary and no-bypass contract. | Required by PKG-00 architecture basis referenced in `_CONTEXT.md`. |
> | Canonical JSON / JCS-compatible canonicalization | Relevant when exported JSON payloads or manifests are hashed for reproducibility. | Hash implementation belongs primarily to DEL-08-02 / future implementation; this deliverable shall preserve compatible references. |
> | OpenPipeStress invariant catalog | IP, data, units, rule-pack, privacy, professional-responsibility, and agent-boundary constraints. | Binding project governance draft. |
>
> No protected engineering code, standard clause text, standards table, commercial example, or proprietary rule content is used as an authority in this setup artifact.
>

### CLM-013 — Verification

> ##### Verification
>
> Future implementation acceptance should include the following checks:
>
> | Verification ID | Check | Expected result |
> |---|---|---|
> | V-1 | Validate a representative JSON result envelope against the result schema. | Schema validation passes and required envelope fields are present. |
> | V-2 | Export a result set with unit-bearing displacements, rotations, forces, moments, reactions, stresses, and ratios. | Each value family carries explicit unit/dimensional metadata or a blocking diagnostic. |
> | V-3 | Export a run with missing rule-pack input or missing provenance. | Export includes structured diagnostics/findings instead of silent defaults. |
> | V-4 | Export a run with rule-pack references. | Envelope records rule-pack identity/version/checksum/source status without copying private formulas or protected values. |
> | V-5 | Re-export an equivalent result set. | Stable identifiers and ordering allow deterministic regression comparison. |
> | V-6 | Route the export through an adapter or downstream tool. | Unit, provenance, diagnostics, and professional-boundary fields are preserved. |
> | V-7 | Scan public fixtures/templates for protected content and approval/compliance claims. | Protected/private data and certification/compliance claims are absent or blocked. |
> | V-8 | Generate a report or GUI result view from the export. | Consumer can distinguish mechanics, user-rule, diagnostics, and human-review-required statuses. |
>

### CLM-017 — Purpose

> ##### Purpose
>
> This procedure describes how to maintain the setup artifact for the result export format and how a later implementation brief should convert the setup specification into a governed result export contract.
>

### CLM-018 — Prerequisites

> ##### Prerequisites
>
> | Prerequisite | Why it matters | Source |
> |---|---|---|
> | Deliverable identity and scope for DEL-08-04 | Keeps the work bounded to SOW-046, OBJ-007, and OBJ-009. | `_CONTEXT.md` |
> | PKG-00 result-envelope/API no-bypass architecture basis | Establishes schema-first envelopes, diagnostics, unit/provenance boundaries, and adapter no-bypass constraints. | `_CONTEXT.md` Architecture Basis Injection; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` AB-00-03, AB-00-06, AB-00-07 |
> | Unit system and dimensional-analysis core contract | Result exports need unit-aware values and dimensional checks. | `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-UNIT-1; upstream DEL-02-02 |
> | Canonical domain model and result object semantics | Result exports need stable model/result references and object vocabulary. | `docs/TYPES.md` section 8; upstream DEL-02-01 |
> | Audit manifest and model hash | Reproducible exports should carry or reference run/model manifest and hash metadata. | DEL-08-02; `docs/_Registers/ScopeLedger.csv` row SOW-039 |
> | Solver/load/stress result producers | Export format must consume mechanics outputs without redefining solver behavior. | PKG-04 and PKG-05 deliverables |
> | Rule-pack lifecycle and checksum handling | Rule-check exports need rule-pack identity/version/checksum without copying private/protected payloads. | DEL-06-04; `docs/SPEC.md` sections 6 and 8 |
> | Headless runner and adapter surfaces | Downstream automation and adapter workflows need the governed envelope contract. | DEL-10-02 and DEL-10-05 |
>

### CLM-019 — Steps

> ##### Steps
>
> 1. Confirm the current brief is limited to DEL-08-04 and does not authorize edits to `schemas/results.schema.yaml`, exporter source, tests, or documentation outside this deliverable folder.
> 2. Read `_CONTEXT.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, `docs/CONTRACT.md`, `docs/SPEC.md`, `docs/TYPES.md`, `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md`, `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md`, and the register rows for DEL-08-04 and SOW-046.
> 3. Treat the baseline export as a schema-first JSON result envelope. Record additional formats as `TBD` unless a later human-approved scope change chooses them.
> 4. Define future envelope responsibilities at setup level: result identity, model/run references, unit-aware values, diagnostics, provenance, analysis status, warnings, and reproducibility references.
> 5. Keep mechanics results, user-rule-check outcomes, missing-data findings, and human review/approval records separate in terminology and future fields.
> 6. Confirm that no public artifact embeds protected standards text, standards tables, proprietary formulas, private rule-pack payloads, private project data, or automatic compliance/approval claims.
> 7. Record dependency edges only when source documents state an explicit anchor, prerequisite, interface, or handoff. Do not add structural adjacency or coordination-only edges.
> 8. For a later implementation brief, create or edit schemas/exporter/tests only inside that later brief's write scope and run the applicable schema, unit, diagnostics, protected-content, and regression gates.
>

### CLM-020 — Verification

> ##### Verification
>
> | Check | Expected result |
> |---|---|
> | Four-document setup kit | `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, and `Procedure.md` exist with stable default sections. |
> | Scope boundary | No files outside `execution/PKG-08_Reporting, Audit, and Reproducibility/1_Working/DEL-08-04_Result export format/**` are edited. |
> | Format boundary | JSON result envelope baseline is stated; additional export formats remain `TBD`. |
> | Unit/provenance/diagnostic boundary | Unit-aware values, provenance, diagnostics, and no-bypass adapter constraints are visible in the specification. |
> | Protected/private boundary | No protected standards text, copied tables, proprietary formulas, private rule-pack payloads, private project data, or certification/compliance claims are introduced. |
> | Dependency register | `Dependencies.csv` validates against v3.1 schema and `_DEPENDENCIES.md` counts match the CSV. |
> | Lifecycle state | `_STATUS.md` is `SEMANTIC_READY` only after the four docs, semantic matrix, lensing register, and dependency extraction setup gates pass. |
>

### CLM-021 — Records

> ##### Records
>
> The setup run should leave these records in the deliverable folder:
>
> - Four production documents: `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, `Procedure.md`
> - Semantic artifacts: `_SEMANTIC.md`, `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md`
> - Dependency artifacts: `Dependencies.csv`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`
> - Run records: `_run_records/TASK_RUN_2026-04-30_*.md`
> - Lifecycle status: `_STATUS.md`

- **VER-001** — Validate the contract and review source parity, schema-first JSON baseline, retained TBD format choices, unit and diagnostic completeness, deterministic comparison identity, provenance and rule-pack references, adapter no-bypass behavior, protected-content limits, and every governed residual.

## Governing Values and Decisions — Axiology

### CLM-022 — Guidance: DEL-08-04 Result export format

> #### Guidance: DEL-08-04 Result export format
>

### CLM-023 — Purpose

> ##### Purpose
>
> The result export format exists to make solver and rule-check outputs reviewable, reproducible, comparable, and consumable by downstream tools without losing the project boundaries that make OpenPipeStress code-neutral. The setup baseline is a schema-first JSON result envelope; other export formats remain `TBD`.
>

### CLM-024 — Principles

> ##### Principles
>
> - Preserve the result envelope as the governed contract. Downstream tools may consume exports, but they should not bypass unit checks, diagnostics, provenance, public/private data handling, or report controls.
> - Keep the export format review-oriented. A result export can support professional review, but the software must not claim certification, sealing, approval, authentication, or automatic code compliance.
> - Treat units as data, not context. Every exported numeric result needs explicit unit and dimensional meaning, or a diagnostic explaining why it is incomplete.
> - Keep diagnostics structured. Review and regression tools need stable diagnostic codes/classes/severities and affected-object references, not prose-only warnings.
> - Carry reproducibility references without copying private payloads. Model hashes, manifest IDs, solver versions, and rule-pack checksums are appropriate references; protected standards text, proprietary formulas, private rule-pack internals, and owner data are not public export payloads by default.
> - Prefer deterministic ordering and stable identifiers for regression comparison.
> - Use `TBD` for unresolved format decisions. Do not imply that a spreadsheet, CSV, FEA handoff, or other external export has been selected.
>

### CLM-025 — Considerations

> ##### Considerations
>
> | Topic | Guidance |
> |---|---|
> | Schema-first baseline | Start from JSON result envelopes because they align with the architecture basis and can be validated before exporter code exists. |
> | Results vs reports | Exports are machine-readable result contracts; reports are human-facing review artifacts. Reports may consume exports, but report wording and protected-content controls remain their own workflow. |
> | Mechanics vs rule checks | Mechanics result values and user-rule-check outcomes should remain separately identifiable. A user-rule check is not professional approval. |
> | Diagnostics | Export consumers should be able to filter by diagnostic class, severity, source, affected object, remediation, and provenance. |
> | Regression comparison | Stable object identifiers, result-station identifiers, load-case/combination references, deterministic ordering, and unit metadata are more important than display formatting. |
> | Interoperability | Downstream tools need a governed envelope first. Concrete external formats and transport protocols are later decisions. |
> | Privacy and protected data | Public fixtures should use invented or permissively licensed data only. User-private exports remain user controlled and should not become public defaults. |
>

### CLM-026 — Trade-offs

> ##### Trade-offs
>
> | Trade-off | Setup position |
> |---|---|
> | Single JSON envelope vs many early formats | Use the JSON envelope as the baseline. Additional formats remain `TBD` to avoid premature commitments and governance bypasses. |
> | Verbose metadata vs compact exports | Preserve units, diagnostics, provenance, and status semantics even when compactness is desirable. Reviewability takes precedence over minimal payload size. |
> | Human-readable labels vs stable machine keys | Include stable identifiers for comparison and downstream tooling. Human-readable labels may supplement them but should not be the only references. |
> | Private rule-pack detail vs reproducibility references | Export identifiers, versions, checksums, source notes, and redistribution status; do not copy private formulas or protected values into public artifacts. |
> | Report convenience vs professional boundary | Avoid report/export wording that could be read as approval or compliance. Human review remains external to the software result. |
>

### CLM-027 — Examples

> ##### Examples
>
> The following are setup-level examples of export concerns, not final schema definitions:
>
> | Concern | Acceptable setup direction | Not acceptable in public baseline |
> |---|---|---|
> | A displacement result | Unit-aware value with node/result reference, load-case or combination basis, and source run metadata. | Numeric value without unit metadata or affected-object reference. |
> | A rule-check outcome | User-rule-check result with rule-pack ID/version/checksum and status distinguishing incomplete inputs, checked, or failed. | Automatic `CODE_COMPLIANT` status or copied protected formula text. |
> | A warning | Structured diagnostic with class, severity, source, affected object, message, remediation, and provenance. | Prose-only warning that cannot be traced or compared. |
> | A downstream export | Adapter consumes governed JSON envelope and preserves units/provenance/diagnostics. | Adapter-specific shortcut that drops diagnostics or private-data handling. |
>

### CLM-028 — Conflict Table (for human ruling)

> ##### Conflict Table (for human ruling)
>
> No unresolved source conflicts were found during this setup run. Open format choices remain `TBD` by scope, not a source conflict.
