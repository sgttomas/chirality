# Scope of Work — DEL-08-03

## Purpose and Objective Traceability

This migration candidate defines `DEL-08-03` in service of project scope [SOW-024] and package objectives [OBJ-007, OBJ-011].

- **OUT-001** — A report-section contract covering warnings, assumptions, missing solve and rule inputs, user-supplied values, provenance, units, reproducibility references, and professional-review notices is produced.

## Deliverable Definition — Ontology

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Datasheet.md","line_end":49,"line_start":39,"source_sha256":"1084bca29063ad168f42671b9a1929f45d9d5285740077ecbfa6ecfa99128bf0","target_id":"CLM-005"} -->
##### Conditions

| Condition | Datasheet Value |
|---|---|
| Implementation state for this setup run | Documentation/setup only; no report code is implemented in this session |
| Required upstream inputs | Diagnostic/result-envelope contract, warning classes, report generator integration point, audit manifest/hash metadata, and protected-content guardrails |
| User/private data handling | Report section may reference private rule-pack or source identifiers but must not expose protected/private content in public templates by default |
| Engineering values | No engineering values are created here; unknown or absent values remain `TBD` or report findings |
| Certification/compliance claims | Prohibited for software-generated report language |
| Unit handling | Any future rendered values must preserve units and dimensional context; this setup artifact does not define value schemas |

##### Construction

The future report section is expected to be a report-renderer subsection that consumes already-classified diagnostics and provenance metadata rather than creating new engineering judgments. The section should present the following report-facing groups:

| Group | Purpose | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Missing data | Expose absent solve-required or rule-check-required inputs | Do not infer or backfill engineering values |
| Warnings | Render diagnostic classes from GUI/core/result envelopes | Do not reclassify solver or rule-engine findings without evidence |
| Assumptions | Show user/model assumptions requiring review | Do not convert assumptions into accepted facts |
| User-supplied values | Identify values supplied by users, private libraries, or rule packs where report-facing provenance is needed | Do not reproduce protected source content |
| Source/provenance notes | Summarize source identity, license/redistribution status, checksum/ref where applicable, and review status where available | Do not claim legal sufficiency or professional acceptance |
| Professional notice | State the software output is decision support and requires competent human review before reliance | Do not claim certification, sealing, approval, or code compliance |

### CLM-020 — Steps

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Procedure.md","line_end":68,"line_start":28,"source_sha256":"27ebcd538626e25d6a25f60dd755810ad85ea1da04f3b260b1b8b5fe31783e89","target_id":"CLM-020"} -->
##### Steps

1. Confirm scope.
   - Verify the work remains limited to DEL-08-03 report-section behavior.
   - Do not implement unrelated report generator, manifest, export, linter, GUI, solver, or rule-engine code.

2. Identify input payloads.
   - Use diagnostics/result envelopes as the source for warning class, code, severity, source, affected object, message, remediation, and provenance.
   - Use report/audit manifest inputs for software version, solver version, model hash, rule-pack name/version/checksum, and source notes where supplied.
   - Mark unavailable fields `TBD` instead of inventing values.

3. Map report subsections.
   - Missing data findings.
   - Warnings grouped or filterable by class/severity/source.
   - Assumptions requiring review.
   - User-supplied values and private/public source status.
   - Source/provenance summary.
   - Professional-responsibility and protected-content notices.

4. Preserve boundaries.
   - Do not reproduce protected standards text, copied standards tables, copied code formulas, material allowables, SIF/flexibility tables, protected dimensional tables, or proprietary vendor data in public templates/examples.
   - Do not claim certification, sealing, approval, authentication, endorsement, or automatic code compliance.
   - Do not transmit or publish private project/rule-pack/library data by default.
   - Bind final professional-boundary wording to a canonical product-claims policy or approved report notice when available; until then, keep wording conservative and mark exact final text `TBD`.

5. Implement or refresh report fixtures.
   - Include at least one fixture for each warning class listed in the diagnostics basis where upstream fixtures exist.
   - Include fixtures for missing solve data, missing rule-check data, missing provenance, assumptions, private rule-pack reference, and human-review-required status.
   - Use invented/non-code data only for public examples.

6. Verify output.
   - Run report snapshot or equivalent tests for expected section content.
   - Run protected-content lint once DEL-08-05 or equivalent tooling is available.
   - Confirm unit-bearing values retain units.
   - Confirm status language distinguishes mechanics solve, user rule check, and human review.

7. Record evidence.
   - List changed report-section files and tests.
   - Record validation commands/results.
   - Record warnings, `TBD` fields, and open dependencies.

### CLM-024 — D-41 R5 T7 PDU-055 current declaration

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":11,"line_start":4,"source_sha256":"a5362f1163cc2110979a007691ac0d6688d8f9ae3dffc0364c2736678910fddf","target_id":"CLM-024"} -->
##### D-41 R5 T7 PDU-055 current declaration

Current authority is `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` revision 0.8, approved `execution/_DAG/DAG-007/` graph context, and D-41/`DEC-074` through the completed T1-T6 bounded records. The implemented working-tree slice and its evidence supersede this surface's setup-only, future-only, or overtaken TBD wording as a current declaration; that earlier wording remains historical setup context only.

Surviving deliverable-local residuals and gates are those recorded in `_STATUS.md ## Remaining`; dated MEMORY and formal-review history remain unchanged. This refresh does not imply lifecycle, review, validation, release, professional-reliance, or code-compliance closure.

PDU-055 cited claim(s): `DEL-08-03-DECL-003`.

### CLM-025 — Purpose

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":15,"line_start":12,"source_sha256":"a5362f1163cc2110979a007691ac0d6688d8f9ae3dffc0364c2736678910fddf","target_id":"CLM-025"} -->
##### Purpose

This deliverable exists so calculation reports make uncertainty, missing inputs, assumptions, and provenance visible to professional reviewers. The section should help a reviewer see what the software computed, what the user supplied, what remains incomplete, and what must not be treated as software-certified engineering approval.

### CLM-026 — Principles

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":26,"line_start":16,"source_sha256":"a5362f1163cc2110979a007691ac0d6688d8f9ae3dffc0364c2736678910fddf","target_id":"CLM-026"} -->
##### Principles

| Principle | Guidance |
|---|---|
| Findings over defaults | Missing solve-required or rule-check-required values should appear as explicit findings, not be filled by convenience defaults. |
| Provenance over opacity | Values affecting engineering reliance should carry source/provenance notes or a visible `TBD`/unknown-source finding. |
| Warnings preserve origin | Report rendering should carry diagnostic class, severity, source, affected object, and remediation from the producing layer when available. |
| Decision support only | Report language may support professional review but must not claim certification, sealing, approval, authentication, or automatic code compliance. |
| Protected-content restraint | Public templates/examples may identify rule-pack references and checksums but must not reproduce protected standards text, tables, copied formulas, or proprietary content. |
| Unit visibility | Values shown in the section should preserve unit context wherever units exist in upstream data. |

### CLM-027 — Considerations

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":34,"line_start":27,"source_sha256":"a5362f1163cc2110979a007691ac0d6688d8f9ae3dffc0364c2736678910fddf","target_id":"CLM-027"} -->
##### Considerations

The report section should be a consumer of upstream diagnostics and provenance, not a source of new engineering meaning. If upstream data says a rule-pack input is missing, the report should expose that state. If a source note is missing, the report should expose that as a provenance warning. If a human has not accepted the output for project use, the report should not imply that acceptance.

The section should remain useful even when upstream components are incomplete. `TBD`, `UNKNOWN_SOURCE`, or missing manifest fields are acceptable setup outputs when the evidence is not available. They should be made visible rather than normalized away.

When upstream diagnostic or provenance fields are missing, the safer report behavior is to preserve the missingness as `TBD` or an explicit warning. Inferring a message, source, severity, or professional disposition inside the report renderer would create unaudited meaning and could blur the boundary between software output and engineering judgment.

### CLM-028 — Trade-offs

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":43,"line_start":35,"source_sha256":"a5362f1163cc2110979a007691ac0d6688d8f9ae3dffc0364c2736678910fddf","target_id":"CLM-028"} -->
##### Trade-offs

| Trade-off | Preferred Direction |
|---|---|
| Readability vs audit detail | Keep the section readable, but retain machine-traceable warning/provenance fields in the report source data. |
| Private detail vs public safety | Public templates should reference private rule-pack/library identity, version, checksum, and source notes without exposing protected/private content by default. |
| Concise warnings vs remediation | Include enough remediation/source context for review; avoid turning warnings into instructions that imply professional acceptance. |
| Early implementation vs dependency maturity | Future code may begin with schema-backed fixtures and `TBD` integration points while upstream diagnostics, manifest, and linter deliverables mature. |

### CLM-029 — Examples

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":55,"line_start":44,"source_sha256":"a5362f1163cc2110979a007691ac0d6688d8f9ae3dffc0364c2736678910fddf","target_id":"CLM-029"} -->
##### Examples

The following examples are invented reporting patterns only. They do not encode code-specific requirements or protected standards content.

| Scenario | Report Section Behavior |
|---|---|
| Rule-pack required input is absent | Show a rule-check blocking finding, affected object/reference if supplied, and remediation such as "provide required user/rule-pack input"; do not report a pass/fail code result. |
| Component value has no source note | Show the value only with its unit context if otherwise permitted, mark source/provenance as `UNKNOWN_SOURCE` or `TBD`, and emit a provenance warning. |
| User entered an assumption for a support condition | Show the assumption as user/model-supplied and requiring review; do not treat it as verified project acceptance. |
| Private rule pack is used | Show rule-pack name or ID, version, checksum, private/public status, and source notice if available; do not quote protected formulas or standards clauses in public templates. |
| Solver emitted nonlinear uncertainty | Show nonlinear warning class, severity, source, affected object, and remediation if supplied by the result envelope. |
