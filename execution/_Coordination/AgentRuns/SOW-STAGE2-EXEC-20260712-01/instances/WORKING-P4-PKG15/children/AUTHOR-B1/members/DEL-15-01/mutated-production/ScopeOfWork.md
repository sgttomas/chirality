# Scope of Work — DEL-15-01

## Purpose and Objective Traceability

This Scope of Work defines `DEL-15-01` in service of project scope [SOW-074] and package objectives [OBJ-017].

- **OUT-001** — A canonical schema-first handoff package and manifest contract for traceable downstream modeling and professional-validation workflows is produced.

### CLM-006 — Construction

> ##### Construction
>
> The deliverable is a contract-definition unit with a materialized JSON Schema and invented validation fixture. Construction evidence currently supports the following schema/manifest slots:
>
> | Slot | Required treatment | Source |
> |---|---|---|
> | Package identity | Include stable package identity, schema version, deliverable/package/scope/objective identifiers, and review state fields. | SOW-074; `schemas/handoff_package.schema.json` |
> | Model hash | Represent model basis through the required `model_hash` checksum object, including algorithm, value, canonicalization, and provenance. | SOW-074; AB-00-04 hash basis; `schemas/handoff_package.schema.json` |
> | Canonicalization label | Use `deterministic_sorted_compact_json_payload_hash` only for the existing sorted-key compact-JSON byte basis; do not interpret it as RFC 8785. Legacy JCS-compatible labels remain accepted until their producers are separately repaired. | `DEC-074` E1; `schemas/handoff_package.schema.json` |
> | Units manifest | Represent explicit units through the required `units_manifest` object, including unit system, dimensional basis, entries, diagnostics, and provenance. | SOW-074; `docs/SPEC.md#4-unit-system-and-dimensional-analysis`; `schemas/handoff_package.schema.json` |
> | Entity IDs | Preserve stable model/entity identifiers through required `entity_ids` records with `entity_id`, `entity_kind`, `source_ref`, and optional mapping keys. | SOW-074; `docs/TYPES.md#2-stable-identifiers`; `schemas/handoff_package.schema.json` |
> | Library/rule references | Reference libraries and rule packs through `library_refs` and `rule_pack_refs` identity/checksum/provenance records without copying protected/private payloads. | SOW-074; `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md`; `docs/SPEC.md#9-reporting-and-audit`; `schemas/handoff_package.schema.json` |
> | Warnings and unresolved assumptions | Carry structured `warnings`, `unresolved_assumptions`, and `diagnostics` as review evidence with source/provenance fields. | SOW-074; `docs/SPEC.md#8-gui-requirements`; `docs/SPEC.md#9-reporting-and-audit`; `schemas/handoff_package.schema.json` |
> | Target mapping metadata | Reserve a manifest surface for mapping to downstream target fields. Detailed target mapping contract is DEL-15-02. | SOW-074; DEL-15-02 row in decomposition |
> | Unsupported-target flags | Reserve explicit unsupported/approximate target behavior flags. Detailed target contract is DEL-15-02. | SOW-074; OI-015 |
> | Provenance | Preserve source/provenance for reliance-affecting data through the schema's required `provenance` object and nested reference provenance records. | `docs/DIRECTIVE.md#22-epistemology--what-is-warranted`; `docs/CONTRACT.md#1-invariant-index`; `schemas/handoff_package.schema.json` |

### CLM-011 — Requirements

> ##### Requirements
>
> | Req ID | Requirement | Source | Verification |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | DEL-15-01-R01 | The handoff package contract shall be represented as a schema-first API/data contract. | `_CONTEXT.md` Type `API_CONTRACT`; `docs/TYPES.md#3-software-deliverable-types` | Confirm artifact naming and schema document role in this deliverable. |
> | DEL-15-01-R02 | The schema baseline shall use JSON Schema 2020-12 unless a later approved architecture change supersedes it. | `_CONTEXT.md#Architecture Basis Injection`; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md#82-resolved-architecture-baseline` | Validate `schemas/handoff_package.schema.json` with Draft 2020-12 tooling. |
> | DEL-15-01-R03 | The package shall include or reference a model hash through the required `model_hash` checksum object, including algorithm, value, canonicalization, and provenance. | SOW-074; AB-00-04 | Review schema properties and fixture validation for model-hash presence. |
> | DEL-15-01-R04 | The package shall include a `units_manifest` with unit system, dimensional basis, entries, diagnostics, and provenance sufficient to avoid silent missing-unit behavior. | SOW-074; `docs/SPEC.md#4-unit-system-and-dimensional-analysis`; OPS-K-UNIT-1 | Schema review plus fixture validation for unit-related fields. |
> | DEL-15-01-R05 | The package shall preserve stable entity IDs used by downstream mapping and review through `entity_ids` records. | SOW-074; `docs/TYPES.md#2-stable-identifiers`; `docs/TYPES.md#8-canonical-domain-object-registry` | Schema review for required ID/reference fields and no positional-only coupling. |
> | DEL-15-01-R06 | The package shall carry library and rule-pack references by identity, version/checksum/source note, or equivalent reference metadata without copying protected/private payloads through `library_refs` and `rule_pack_refs`. | SOW-074; `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md#6-private-user-data`; `docs/SPEC.md#9-reporting-and-audit` | Protected-content/privacy review and schema review for reference-only design. |
> | DEL-15-01-R07 | The package shall carry unresolved assumptions, warnings, and diagnostics as explicit review evidence, not silent defaults. | SOW-074; OPS-K-DATA-2; AB-00-06; `docs/SPEC.md#8-gui-requirements` | Schema review for `unresolved_assumptions`, `warnings`, `diagnostics`, and provenance fields. |
> | DEL-15-01-R08 | The package shall reserve target mapping metadata required by SOW-074 while leaving detailed target mapping rules to DEL-15-02. | SOW-074; DEL-15-02 row in decomposition | Cross-deliverable interface review against `schemas/target_mapping.schema.json`. |
> | DEL-15-01-R09 | The package shall reserve unsupported-target flags required by SOW-074 while leaving detailed unsupported behavior semantics to DEL-15-02. | SOW-074; OI-015 | Cross-deliverable interface review against `schemas/target_mapping.schema.json`. |
> | DEL-15-01-R10 | The package and manifest shall preserve provenance for reliance-affecting data and references. | OPS-K-DATA-3; `docs/DIRECTIVE.md#25-axiology--what-values-govern`; `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md#4-required-provenance-fields` | Schema review for provenance-bearing records and protected-content gate. |

> | DEL-15-01-R12 | The package container remains TBD. OI-015 names initial export and target surfaces, while concrete mappings, unsupported-behavior taxonomy extensions, target field coverage, and target-specific implementation remain gated by DEL-17-01 and DEL-17-02. | OI-015; `_CONTEXT.md#Architecture Basis Injection` | Confirm the handoff schema remains target-neutral and does not claim target-specific mapping maturity. |
> | DEL-15-01-R13 | Checksum canonicalization metadata shall distinguish the existing Python sorted-key compact-JSON payload-hash basis as `deterministic_sorted_compact_json_payload_hash`; this value is not an RFC 8785/JCS claim. The existing `JCS_compatible_json_payload_hash` value remains accepted for backward compatibility until separately authorized producer repairs land. | D-41 `DEC-074` E1; PDU-002 prerequisite | Focused schema tests accept both values, assert the non-JCS boundary, and do not change producer or fixture output. |

> Define the bounded procedure for producing and reviewing the canonical handoff package schema and manifest contract for DEL-15-01. This procedure is operational guidance for the deliverable artifact; it does not implement runtime export behavior.
>
> Sources: `_CONTEXT.md`; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md`; `docs/CONTRACT.md`; `docs/SPEC.md`.
>

### CLM-018 — Prerequisites

> ##### Prerequisites
>
> | Prerequisite | Evidence / status |
> |---|---|
> | DEL-15-01 context and references are available. | `_CONTEXT.md`; `_REFERENCES.md` |
> | SOW-074 and OBJ-017 are the active scope/objective basis. | `_CONTEXT.md`; decomposition; registers |
> | JSON Schema 2020-12 is the schema baseline. | `_CONTEXT.md#Architecture Basis Injection`; AB-00-04/AB-00-07 |
> | Unit, provenance, diagnostics, privacy, protected-content, and professional-boundary invariants are available. | `docs/CONTRACT.md`; `docs/SPEC.md`; `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md` |
> | Existing DAG-002 mirror rows remain ACTIVE evidence and are not reclassified by this setup run. | local `Dependencies.csv`; `_DEPENDENCIES.md` |
> | Package container, concrete mappings, target field coverage, and target-specific implementation remain unresolved. | OI-015; DEL-17-01; DEL-17-02 |
>

### CLM-019 — Steps

> ##### Steps
>
> 1. Confirm deliverable identity from `_CONTEXT.md`, including DEL-15-01, PKG-15, type `API_CONTRACT`, SOW-074, OBJ-017, and anticipated artifacts.
> 2. Read the DEL-15-01 decomposition entry and associated SOW-074 / OBJ-017 rows. Record scope as schema/manifest contract work, not runtime export implementation.
> 3. List required handoff-package slots from SOW-074: model hash, units manifest, entity IDs, library/rule references, unresolved assumptions, warnings, target mapping metadata, unsupported-target flags, and provenance.
> 4. Apply architecture-basis constraints that are explicitly injected into `_CONTEXT.md`: JSON Schema 2020-12 contracts, precise canonicalization metadata, schema-first envelopes, and no-bypass adapter controls. For the existing Python sorted-key compact-JSON basis, use `deterministic_sorted_compact_json_payload_hash` and do not claim RFC 8785 JCS.
> 5. Treat `schemas/handoff_package.schema.json`, its `$id`, and `fixtures/invented_handoff_package.json` as materialized contract evidence; keep package container, concrete mappings, target field coverage, and target-specific implementation gated under OI-015 / DEL-17-01 / DEL-17-02.
> 6. Draft or review schema artifacts and fixtures so they preserve references and metadata without copying protected standards text, private project data, private rule-pack payloads, proprietary commercial data, or real secrets.
> 7. Ensure the manifest design includes structured warnings, assumptions, provenance, unit metadata, hashes, and professional-boundary posture.
> 8. Verify that target mapping metadata and unsupported-target flags are present as contract surfaces while detailed semantics remain delegated to DEL-15-02.
> 9. Check that no field, enum, status, or explanatory text creates automatic professional approval, certification, sealing, authentication, endorsement, or code-compliance claims.
> 10. Validate dependency artifacts locally if `Dependencies.csv` exists using `python3 tools/validation/validate_dependencies_schema.py`.
> 11. Confirm `JCS_compatible_json_payload_hash` remains accepted for backward compatibility, while producer outputs and fixtures remain unchanged until separately authorized repair tasks.
>

### CLM-020 — Verification

> ##### Verification
>
> | Verification item | Method |
> |---|---|
> | Source grounding | Check each non-trivial requirement against `_CONTEXT.md`, decomposition, registers, local DAG-002 mirror, or governing references. |
> | Schema baseline | Validate `schemas/handoff_package.schema.json` with `jsonschema.Draft202012Validator.check_schema` and validate the invented fixture with `python3 tests/test_handoff_package_schema.py`. |
> | Canonicalization vocabulary | Run focused pytest cases proving the new non-JCS label validates, the legacy JCS-compatible label still validates, and the schema explicitly denies RFC 8785 conformance for the new label. |
> | Required slots | Confirm the SOW-074 slots are present as requirements or explicit TBD surfaces. |
> | TBD discipline | Confirm package container, concrete mappings, target field coverage, and target-specific implementation are not invented. Schema property names and validation fixture are now materialized evidence. |
> | Data boundary | Check that schema guidance does not embed protected/private/proprietary payloads or examples. |
> | Professional boundary | Check that the contract does not emit automatic approval/compliance/certification statuses. |
> | Dependency mirror preservation | Confirm approved DAG-006 rows remain ACTIVE and are not retired, deleted, or reclassified. |
>

### CLM-021 — Records

> ##### Records
>
> Maintain these records in the DEL-15-01 folder for setup:
>
> - `Datasheet.md`
> - `Specification.md`
> - `Guidance.md`
> - `Procedure.md`
> - `_SEMANTIC.md`

> | Evidence preservation | Prefer references, hashes, manifests, and provenance over copied private/protected payloads. | `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md`; OPS-K-IP-1 through OPS-K-DATA-3 |
> | Unit explicitness | Do not allow missing or ambiguous units to become downstream assumptions. | `docs/SPEC.md#4-unit-system-and-dimensional-analysis`; OPS-K-UNIT-1 |
> | Stable identity | Preserve stable object/entity identity so downstream mapping can be reviewed and reconciled. | SOW-074; `docs/TYPES.md#2-stable-identifiers` |
> | Canonicalization truth | Label the existing Python sorted-key compact-JSON payload hash as `deterministic_sorted_compact_json_payload_hash`. This deterministic basis is not RFC 8785 JCS. Retain `JCS_compatible_json_payload_hash` only for backward compatibility with producers not yet repaired. | D-41 `DEC-074` E1; PDU-002 prerequisite |
> | Boundary clarity | Keep target mapping and unsupported behavior explicit. OI-015 now names initial export and target surfaces, while concrete mappings, unsupported-behavior taxonomy extensions, target field coverage, and target-specific implementation remain gated by DEL-17-01 and DEL-17-02. | SOW-074; DEL-15-02 row; OI-015 |
> | Professional non-authority | The handoff package may support professional validation workflows, but it must not create automatic approval, certification, sealing, endorsement, or code-compliance states. | OBJ-017; OPS-K-AUTH-1; `docs/TYPES.md#4-analysis-status-vocabulary` |

### CLM-026 — Considerations

> ##### Considerations
>
> - The physical package/container remains unresolved for this deliverable. OI-015 names initial export and target surfaces, but concrete mappings, unsupported-behavior taxonomy extensions, target field coverage, and target-specific implementation remain gated by DEL-17-01 and DEL-17-02.
> - DAG-002 rows identify important upstream context, including architecture basis, local FEA handoff contract, result export format, audit manifest/model hash, immutable model states, analysis run records, and canonical domain model schema. These rows are dependency evidence, not authority to inspect or modify sibling deliverable folders during this task.
> - Target mapping metadata and unsupported-target flags are required by SOW-074, but detailed semantics belong to DEL-15-02. DEL-15-01 should reserve clear schema surfaces for those records.
> - The deliverable now has an invented, non-engineering fixture at `fixtures/invented_handoff_package.json`. Public examples or fixtures for this contract must remain invented or otherwise reviewed and must not include protected standards text, private rule-pack payloads, proprietary commercial files, or real project data.
> - Handoff package validation is covered by `tests/test_handoff_package_schema.py`, including Draft 2020-12 schema validation and fixture validation. It should not attempt to prove external solver correctness or code compliance.
> - This prerequisite changes vocabulary only. Do not rewrite producer output,
>   fixtures, or downstream schemas here, and do not infer RFC 8785 conformance
>   from stable sorted-key compact serialization.

### CLM-027 — Trade-offs

> ##### Trade-offs
>
> | Trade-off | Preferred direction | Reason |
> |---|---|---|
> | Rich payload vs reference-heavy manifest | Prefer reference-heavy records for private/protected or large payloads. | Preserves data boundary and avoids copying private/protected values. |
> | Target-neutral vs target-specific fields | Keep DEL-15-01 target-neutral and reserve extension/mapping surfaces. | Detailed target mapping belongs to DEL-15-02 and target-specific implementation remains gated by DEL-17-01 and DEL-17-02. |
> | Strict required fields vs unresolved project reality | Require the slots named by SOW-074 using the materialized schema property map. | Avoids hidden defaults while preserving target-specific and container deferrals. |
> | Software status vs professional status | Emit diagnostics/findings and human-review-needed notices, not approval/compliance states. | Maintains OPS-K-AUTH-1 and OBJ-017. |
>

### CLM-028 — Examples

> ##### Examples
>
> The current invented example payload is `fixtures/invented_handoff_package.json`. It is provenance-labeled, non-engineering fixture data used to validate `schemas/handoff_package.schema.json` with `jsonschema.Draft202012Validator` through `tests/test_handoff_package_schema.py`.
>
> Any future example must avoid protected standards content, private project data, private rule-pack content, proprietary values, real secrets, and automatic professional-approval claims.

### CLM-029 — Conflict Table (for human ruling)

> ##### Conflict Table (for human ruling)
>
> No direct source conflicts were identified in this setup pass. The following open items are unresolved rather than conflicting:
>
> | Conflict ID | Conflict (short statement) | Source A (file + section) | Source B (file + section) | Impacted sections | Proposed authority (PROPOSAL) | Human ruling (TBD) |
> |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> | OI-015-OPEN | Current decomposition names initial export and target surfaces, but concrete mappings, unsupported-behavior taxonomy extensions, target field coverage, target-specific implementation, and this deliverable's physical package/container remain gated. | `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md#11-open-issues` | `_CONTEXT.md#Scope Detail` | Datasheet Attributes; Specification Requirements; Procedure Steps | Keep DEL-15-01 target-neutral; do not claim target-specific mapping maturity before DEL-17-01 and DEL-17-02 evidence. | TBD |
