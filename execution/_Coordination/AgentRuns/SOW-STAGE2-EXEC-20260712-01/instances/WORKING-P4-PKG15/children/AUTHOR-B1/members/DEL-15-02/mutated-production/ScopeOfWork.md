# Scope of Work — DEL-15-02

## Purpose and Objective Traceability

This Scope of Work defines `DEL-15-02` in service of project scope [SOW-074] and package objectives [OBJ-017].

- **OUT-001** — A provider-neutral target-mapping and unsupported or approximate behavior contract for handoff exports is produced.

### CLM-010 — Scope

> ##### Scope
>
> This deliverable defines an API contract for target mapping metadata and unsupported or approximate behavior flags used by handoff exports. It covers the target mapping schema and unsupported behavior taxonomy identified in `_CONTEXT.md`.
>
> This deliverable excludes target-specific commercial parser implementation, automatic external-prover approval states, professional acceptance records, comprehensive commercial-tool result ingestion, and any claim that a downstream target has validated, certified, sealed, or approved the engineering work. These exclusions are grounded in the PKG-15 package exclusion and the professional-boundary constraints in `docs/CONTRACT.md`.

### CLM-020 — Steps

> ##### Steps
>
> 1. Confirm the deliverable identity:
>    - Use DEL-15-02, PKG-15, API_CONTRACT, SOW-074, and OBJ-017 from `_CONTEXT.md`.
>
> 2. Confirm governing boundaries:
>    - Apply unit awareness, provenance, no silent defaults, professional-boundary, protected-content, and private-data constraints from `docs/CONTRACT.md`, `docs/DIRECTIVE.md`, `docs/SPEC.md`, `docs/TYPES.md`, and `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md`.
>
> 3. Define the contract scope:
>    - Include target mapping metadata.
>    - Include unsupported-target flags.
>    - Include approximate behavior disclosure as an explicit ASSUMPTION from the decomposition wording.
>    - Use `schemas/target_mapping.schema.json` and `core/handoff/target_mapping/contract.py` for provider-neutral schema path, property names, and taxonomy values.
>    - Keep exact commercial target names and target-specific taxonomy/strategy values as TBD unless accepted source material resolves them.
>
> 4. Map upstream handoff context:
>    - Treat the canonical handoff package schema and manifest as a required predecessor.
>    - Preserve model hash, units manifest, entity IDs, library/rule references, unresolved assumptions, and warnings as handoff context where the final contract supports them.
>
> 5. Define unsupported behavior handling:
>    - Record unsupported or approximate behavior as explicit flags, findings, diagnostics, or TBD slots.
>    - Do not coerce unsupported behavior into defaults.
>    - Do not claim target-tool equivalence, validation, certification, approval, or code compliance.
>
> 6. Define privacy and protected-content handling:
>    - Prefer stable references, checksums, source notes, review state, and redaction status.
>    - Exclude private project data, protected standards text, proprietary formulas, proprietary values, and private rule-pack payloads from public artifacts by default.
>
> 7. Check dependencies:
>    - Read the deliverable-local `Dependencies.csv` as an approved DAG-006 mirror/evidence surface.
>    - Preserve all approved DAG-006 rows as ACTIVE for this workflow.
>    - Record any conflict with dependency-extract normalization rules rather than rewriting the mirror.
>
> 8. Record unresolved decisions:
>    - Initial export and target surfaces: named by OI-015.
>    - Canonical package container: TBD.
>    - Concrete mappings and target field coverage: gated by DEL-17-01 and DEL-17-02.
>    - Target-specific implementation strategy: gated by DEL-17-01 and DEL-17-02.
>    - Target-specific unsupported behavior taxonomy extensions: gated by DEL-17-01 and DEL-17-02.
>    - Provider-neutral schema path and property names: materialized in `schemas/target_mapping.schema.json`.
>

### CLM-021 — Verification

> ##### Verification
>
> | Check | Expected result |
> |---|---|
> | Four-document consistency | Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, and Procedure use the same deliverable ID, package ID, scope item, objective, and TBD boundaries. |
> | Source grounding | Non-trivial claims cite `_CONTEXT.md`, decomposition/registers, approved dependency mirror, or listed governing docs. |
> | Unsupported behavior | Unsupported and approximate behavior are explicit; no silent defaults are introduced. |
> | Privacy/IP boundary | Public artifacts do not copy private/protected payloads. |
> | Professional boundary | No field or procedure creates software-generated approval, certification, sealing, authentication, or code-compliance status. |
> | Dependency mirror preservation | All existing approved DAG-006 rows in `Dependencies.csv` remain ACTIVE and unmodified. |
> | Schema validation | `python3 tests/test_target_mapping_contract.py` validates generated normal and negative contracts against `schemas/target_mapping.schema.json`; `python3 tools/validation/validate_dependencies_schema.py <deliverable>/Dependencies.csv` passes if `Dependencies.csv` exists. |

### CLM-026 — Purpose

> ##### Purpose
>
> This deliverable prevents silent loss of critical handoff assumptions or unsupported target behavior. It supplies the contract surface for explaining how internal OpenPipeStress entities map into a handoff target and where a target cannot carry the source semantics exactly.
>

### CLM-027 — Principles

> ##### Principles
>
> | Principle | Guidance | Source |
> |---|---|---|
> | Explicit non-support | Unsupported target behavior must be visible as a finding or flag, not hidden by defaults. | `_CONTEXT.md` Context Envelope; `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-DATA-2 |
> | Unit safety | Unit-bearing values and exports must preserve unit and dimensional metadata or diagnostics. | `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-UNIT-1; `docs/DIRECTIVE.md` Principles |
> | Provenance preservation | Mapped entities, rule/library references, and reliance-affecting metadata should carry source/provenance references where supported by upstream contracts. | `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-IP-2; `docs/TYPES.md` Provenance |
> | Private-data restraint | Public handoff artifacts should expose references, checksums, review status, and allowed metadata without copying private or protected payloads. | `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md` Private user data; `docs/SPEC.md` result export boundary |
> | Professional-boundary restraint | Handoff support is not software certification, sealing, approval, authentication, or code-compliance determination. | `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-AUTH-1; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` DEC-015 |
> | Deferred target specificity | OI-015 names initial export and target surfaces. Concrete mappings, target field coverage, target-specific taxonomy extensions, and target-specific implementation remain gated by DEL-17-01 and DEL-17-02. | `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` OI-015 |
>

### CLM-028 — Considerations

> ##### Considerations
>
> - Treat target mapping as traceability and disclosure metadata. It does not prove that the target tool reproduced the source model correctly.
> - Treat unsupported and approximate behavior flags as review evidence. They should help a human identify gaps, not resolve those gaps automatically.
> - Favor references to rule packs, libraries, manifests, diagnostics, and hashes over copying private formulas, protected standards text, proprietary values, or private rule-pack payloads.
> - Use `schemas/target_mapping.schema.json` as the provider-neutral schema contract and `core/handoff/target_mapping/contract.py` as the current generated-output implementation surface.
> - Use the materialized provider-neutral behavior fields and statuses for current handoff review. Target-specific mappings, taxonomy extensions, and field coverage remain gated by DEL-17-01 and DEL-17-02.
>

### CLM-029 — Trade-offs

> ##### Trade-offs
>
> | Trade-off | Conservative position |
> |---|---|
> | Generic target contract vs target-specific convenience | Prefer the current provider-neutral schema-first metadata until accepted target-specific export/profile work is in scope. |
> | Rich mapping details vs private-data exposure | Preserve traceability and review evidence while excluding private/protected payloads by default. |
> | Approximation support vs false confidence | Allow approximate behavior disclosure, but do not let it imply equivalence, validation, approval, or compliance. |
> | Automated workflow vs human authority | The software may package and disclose handoff evidence; professional reliance remains external and human-owned. |
>

### CLM-030 — Examples

> ##### Examples
>
> | Example topic | Status |
> |---|---|
> | Provider-neutral target mapping record | Materialized in `schemas/target_mapping.schema.json` and validated by `tests/test_target_mapping_contract.py`. |
> | Unsupported behavior taxonomy values | Provider-neutral behavior statuses and flag records are materialized; target-specific taxonomy extensions remain gated by DEL-17-01 and DEL-17-02. |
> | Approximate behavior flag semantics | Materialized as explicit provider-neutral approximate behavior disclosure; target-specific interpretation remains gated. |
>

### CLM-031 — Conflict Table (for human ruling)

> ##### Conflict Table (for human ruling)
>
> | Conflict ID | Conflict (short statement) | Source A (file + section) | Source B (file + section) | Impacted sections | Proposed authority (PROPOSAL) | Human ruling (TBD) |
> |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> | CT-001 | Dependency-extract v3.1 enum guidance would normalize dependency rows, but the project task rule requires preserving approved DAG-006 mirror rows as ACTIVE without reclassification. | `skills/dependency-extract/SKILL.md` Function 3 and canonical enums | User task instruction; `_DEPENDENCIES.md` Authority Boundary; `Dependencies.csv` approved DAG-006 rows | `Dependencies.csv`; `_DEPENDENCIES.md`; final workflow report | Preserve the approved mirror unchanged for this run. | TBD |
