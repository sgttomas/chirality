# Scope of Work — DEL-15-03

## Purpose and Objective Traceability

This Scope of Work defines `DEL-15-03` in service of project scope [SOW-074] and package objectives [OBJ-017].

- **OUT-001** — A generic schema-compliant downstream modeling export workflow contract using invented target evidence and explicit unsupported-target findings is produced.

## Deliverable Definition — Ontology

### CLM-001 — Datasheet: DEL-15-03 Downstream modeling export workflow

### CLM-004 — Attributes

> ##### Attributes
>
> | Attribute | Value | Source |

>

### CLM-005 — Conditions

> ##### Conditions
>
> | Condition | Status |
> |---|---|
> | Target surfaces, canonical package container, and target-specific implementation | OI-015 names initial export and target surfaces; canonical package container, concrete mappings, target field coverage, and target-specific implementation remain gated by DEL-17-01 and DEL-17-02. |
> | Exact dependency versions and package-specific implementation choices | TBD per `_CONTEXT.md#Architecture Basis Injection`. |
> | Target-specific commercial stress output parsers | Deferred per `_CONTEXT.md#Context Envelope` and `SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md#SOW-074`. |
> | Professional approval, certification, sealing, or code-compliance claims | Excluded by `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-AUTH-1 and OPS-K-AGENT-4. |
> | Unit handling | Exports must remain unit-aware and validate against `schemas/handoff_package.schema.json` and `schemas/target_mapping.schema.json`; target-specific unit export strategy remains TBD under OI-015. |
> | Private/protected data | Must be excluded unless intentionally supplied with documented rights through a governed path. |
>

### CLM-006 — Construction

> ##### Construction
>
> | Construct | Datasheet value |
> |---|---|
> | Primary input contracts | ACTIVE upstream rows in local `Dependencies.csv`, plus `schemas/handoff_package.schema.json` and `schemas/target_mapping.schema.json`. |
> | Primary output | Generic handoff exporter at `core/handoff/exporter/workflow.py` capable of producing a schema-compliant handoff package and provider-neutral target mapping record. |
> | Validation evidence | `tests/test_handoff_export_workflow.py` validates exported handoff/mapping inputs against schema contracts and checks `fixtures/invented_target_fixture.json` provenance. |
> | Unsupported target behavior | Must surface unsupported-target flags and warnings; taxonomy and target mapping records are provided by upstream contract work. |
> | Hash handling | Package/model checksum/reference fields preserve the producer-declared byte-basis label. DEL-15-03 does not recompute, relabel, or assert JCS conformance; package container and target-specific hash packaging remain TBD. |
> | Fixture data | Invented target fixture only; no protected commercial-tool examples or proprietary data. |
>

> ##### D-41 R5 T2A supplied-checksum evidence (2026-07-12)
>
> The downstream workflow carries supplied checksum records without recomputing them. Its governed invented records now use `deterministic_sorted_compact_json_payload_hash`; this is a narrow byte-basis label, not a JCS assertion by DEL-15-03.

### CLM-011 — Requirements

> ##### Requirements
>
> | ID | Requirement | Source | Verification |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | DEL-15-03-REQ-001 | The workflow shall generate schema-compliant handoff packages. | SOW-074 in `_CONTEXT.md` and `SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` | `tests/test_handoff_export_workflow.py` validates exported handoff packages against `schemas/handoff_package.schema.json`. |
> | DEL-15-03-REQ-002 | The package data surfaced by the workflow shall include or preserve model hash, units manifest, entity IDs, library/rule references, unresolved assumptions, warnings, target mapping metadata, and unsupported-target flags. | SOW-074 in `_CONTEXT.md` and `SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` | Fixture-based validation that required fields are present or explicitly reported as TBD/unsupported according to upstream schema contracts. |
> | DEL-15-03-REQ-003 | The workflow shall remain generic and shall not implement target-specific commercial-tool parsers in this deliverable. | `_CONTEXT.md#Context Envelope`; `SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md#SOW-074`; OI-015 | Tests or review evidence confirming invented target fixture use and no commercial parser fixture dependency. |
> | DEL-15-03-REQ-004 | The workflow shall preserve unit metadata across the export boundary. | `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-UNIT-1; `docs/SPEC.md#Unit system and dimensional analysis` | Schema validation and unit-manifest checks. |
> | DEL-15-03-REQ-005 | The workflow shall preserve diagnostics, warnings, unresolved assumptions, provenance, and hashes rather than hiding missing data or boundary risks. | `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-DATA-2, OPS-K-REPORT-1; `docs/TYPES.md` Diagnostic, Assumption, Checksum, ResultExportEnvelope | Export validation tests and review of generated diagnostics/warnings. |
> | DEL-15-03-REQ-006 | The workflow shall not claim certification, sealing, approval, authentication, professional acceptance, or engineering code compliance. | `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-AUTH-1, OPS-K-AGENT-4; `SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` OBJ-017 and DEC-015 | Protected/professional-boundary wording review and tests where applicable. |

>

### CLM-012 — Standards

> ##### Standards
>
> | Standard or governing source | Applicability | Status |
> |---|---|---|
> | JSON Schema 2020-12 | Contract basis for schema-backed handoff/package validation. | Applicable from `_CONTEXT.md#Architecture Basis Injection`; current upstream schemas are `schemas/handoff_package.schema.json` and `schemas/target_mapping.schema.json`. |
> | Producer-declared JSON hash basis | Carry supplied checksum algorithm, payload scope, digest, and canonicalization label unchanged; no recomputation or conformance ruling by this workflow. | Applicable from `_CONTEXT.md#Architecture Basis Injection`; exact producer payload boundaries remain external to DEL-15-03. |
> | OpenPipeStress invariant catalog | Governs data, unit, professional-boundary, IP, privacy, and agent-output constraints. | Applicable from `docs/CONTRACT.md`. |
> | IP and Data Boundary Policy | Governs protected-content, private-data, fixture, and provenance handling. | Applicable from `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md`. |
> | Commercial stress tool formats | Target-specific parsers and commercial examples are out of scope. | Deferred; concrete mappings, target field coverage, and target-specific implementation remain gated by OI-015, DEL-17-01, and DEL-17-02. |
>

### CLM-013 — Verification

> ##### Verification
>
> | Verification item | Evidence expected |
> |---|---|
> | Schema compliance | Validation tests for handoff package output against `schemas/handoff_package.schema.json` and target mapping input against `schemas/target_mapping.schema.json`. |
> | Unit manifest preservation | Tests that exported values carry explicit unit metadata or are explicitly dimensionless/TBD according to schema rules. |
> | Hash/provenance preservation | Tests or review evidence for model/package hash fields, provenance fields, and unresolved assumptions. |
> | Unsupported-target behavior | Invented target fixture that exercises unsupported or approximate mapping behavior without using proprietary commercial examples. |
> | Boundary wording | Review confirming no generated metadata or report-adjacent output claims professional approval, certification, sealing, authentication, or code compliance. |
> | Protected-content screening | Protected-content/provenance gate for fixture and example data. |
>

### CLM-014 — Documentation

> ##### Documentation
>
> Required records for this deliverable are:
>
> - implementation notes identifying `core/handoff/exporter/workflow.py` and the schema-backed output contract;
> - export validation test evidence;
> - invented target fixture provenance and protected-content review status;
> - any unresolved target mapping, package container, hash boundary, or dependency-version TBDs;
> - dependency closure evidence for required upstream contracts before this workflow is treated as implementation-ready.

### CLM-015 — D-41 R5 T2A checksum-boundary requirement (2026-07-12)

> ##### D-41 R5 T2A checksum-boundary requirement (2026-07-12)
>
> DEL-15-03 SHALL preserve supplied checksum metadata without relabeling it as JCS and SHALL NOT imply that carrying a checksum constitutes recomputation, validation, or RFC 8785 conformance.

- **AC-001** — The contract preserves all SOW-074 handoff contents, supplied checksum metadata without recomputation or relabeling, unit and provenance boundaries, diagnostics, warnings, assumptions, schema validation, public-safe invented fixtures, explicit unsupported behavior, upstream contract boundaries, target-specific parser and package-container gates, and professional non-authority without claiming JCS conformance, external validation, or approval.

### CLM-019 — Steps

> ##### Steps
>
> 1. Confirm the work remains inside DEL-15-03 and SOW-074. If implementation needs target-specific commercial parsers, commercial examples, professional approval states, or cross-package rewrites, stop and escalate.
> 2. Identify the upstream handoff package schema and target-mapping contracts available to the implementation: `schemas/handoff_package.schema.json` and `schemas/target_mapping.schema.json`. If later target-specific inputs are not implementation-ready, record the missing inputs as TBD rather than inventing schema fields.
> 3. Define the generic exporter boundary: input model/result context, output handoff package envelope, validation result, warnings, unresolved assumptions, target mapping metadata, unsupported-target flags, and hash/provenance handling.
> 4. Implement or review the exporter using the accepted architecture basis applicable to this backend slice at `core/handoff/exporter/workflow.py`; package-specific dependency versions remain TBD unless resolved by accepted source material.
> 5. Ensure exported payloads preserve unit metadata, entity IDs, references, diagnostics/warnings, assumptions, and hash metadata required by the upstream handoff package contract.
> 6. Add unsupported-target handling that records explicit findings or flags when the target fixture lacks a supported mapping. Do not silently drop or coerce unsupported behavior.
> 7. Create an invented target fixture. Record fixture provenance and protected-content review status; do not use commercial-tool examples or protected standards-derived examples.
> 8. Add export validation tests for schema compliance, unit manifest presence, required identity/reference fields, warnings/assumptions, unsupported-target flags, and professional-boundary wording.
> 9. Run applicable validation gates: `python3 tests/test_handoff_export_workflow.py`, schema validation for exported handoff and mapping inputs, dependency validation, and protected-content/provenance review.
> 10. Record unresolved assumptions, upstream contract gaps, unsupported features, and any dependency conflicts in deliverable-local evidence.
>

### CLM-020 — Verification

> ##### Verification
>
> | Check | Expected result |
> |---|---|
> | Scope check | Work remains a generic handoff export workflow for DEL-15-03. |
> | Schema check | Output validates against `schemas/handoff_package.schema.json` and `schemas/target_mapping.schema.json`. |
> | Unit check | Unit-bearing exported values carry explicit unit metadata or a documented dimensionless/TBD classification. |
> | Warning/assumption check | Missing data and unsupported target behavior are explicit findings, not silent defaults. |
> | Boundary check | Output does not claim certification, sealing, approval, authentication, professional acceptance, or code compliance. |
> | Fixture check | Invented target fixture has provenance and does not use protected or commercial-tool example data. |
> | Dependency check | Approved DAG-002 mirror rows remain preserved; no dependency extraction refresh reclassifies them without human approval. |
>

### CLM-021 — Records

> ##### Records
>
> - Exporter implementation path: `core/handoff/exporter/workflow.py`.
> - Export validation test path: `tests/test_handoff_export_workflow.py`.
> - Invented target fixture path and provenance: `fixtures/invented_target_fixture.json`, validated as invented public metadata.
> - Handoff schema version or source: `schemas/handoff_package.schema.json`.
> - Target mapping taxonomy/source: `schemas/target_mapping.schema.json`.
> - Dependency validation evidence: `Dependencies.csv` schema validation output.
> - Boundary review evidence: focused protected/private/prohibited-authority term scan and exporter tests.

### CLM-022 — D-41 R5 T2A checksum-boundary check (2026-07-12)

> ##### D-41 R5 T2A checksum-boundary check (2026-07-12)
>
> Verify that model and manifest checksum labels are carried unchanged into export payload context and that DEL-15-03 makes no independent JCS claim or checksum-validity ruling.

- **VER-001** — Validate the contract and review source parity, complete handoff content preservation, schema and unit checks, supplied-checksum byte-basis labels, diagnostic and unsupported-target behavior, invented-fixture and protected-content controls, retained target-specific and container TBDs, upstream contract boundaries, and prohibited professional-authority claims.

## Governing Values and Decisions — Axiology

### CLM-023 — Guidance: DEL-15-03 Downstream modeling export workflow

> #### Guidance: DEL-15-03 Downstream modeling export workflow
>

### CLM-024 — Purpose

> ##### Purpose
>
> This deliverable exists to provide the generic handoff export workflow that turns OpenPipeStress model and analysis context into schema-compliant downstream modeling handoff packages. Its purpose is traceable transfer, not external-tool validation or professional approval.
>

### CLM-025 — Principles

> ##### Principles
>
> | Principle | Guidance | Source |
> |---|---|---|
> | Generic before target-specific | Keep the workflow around `schemas/handoff_package.schema.json`, `schemas/target_mapping.schema.json`, and the generic exporter before adding target-specific parsers or profiles. | `_CONTEXT.md#Context Envelope`; `SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md#SOW-074`; OI-015 |
> | Explicit missingness | Missing mapping support, unresolved assumptions, warnings, and unsupported target behavior should be visible in the export output. | SOW-074; `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-DATA-2 |
> | Unit-aware export | Unit metadata must cross the export boundary unless a field is explicitly dimensionless or otherwise classified. | `docs/SPEC.md#Unit system and dimensional analysis`; OPS-K-UNIT-1 |
> | Provenance and hash discipline | Exported packages should preserve references, provenance, rule/library refs, diagnostics, and hashes without treating them as professional acceptance. | `docs/TYPES.md` Assumption, TraceabilityLink, Diagnostic, Checksum, ResultExportEnvelope |
> | Professional boundary | The workflow may support professional review; it must not claim approval, certification, sealing, authentication, or code compliance. | OBJ-017; DEC-015; OPS-K-AUTH-1 |
> | Protected-content boundary | Fixtures must be invented or cleared; do not import protected standards examples or commercial tool files. | `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md`; OPS-K-IP-1 through OPS-K-IP-3 |
>

### CLM-026 — Considerations

> ##### Considerations
>
> - The local `Dependencies.csv` records upstream architecture-basis and interop/security/model-contract inputs as ACTIVE DAG-002 mirror evidence. Treat those rows as coordination evidence, not as permission to copy sibling deliverable prose or implementation details into this folder.
> - Upstream contracts named by the mirror include the canonical handoff package schema, target mapping and unsupported-behavior contract, import/export adapter framework, local FEA handoff data contract, private-data redaction/export controls, physical-to-analytical transformation contract, and comparison export contracts.
> - The workflow should report unsupported-target behavior rather than silently approximating it. Provider-neutral unsupported behavior and target mapping records are now supplied by `schemas/target_mapping.schema.json`; target-specific extensions remain gated by DEL-17-01 and DEL-17-02.
> - The current fixture is `fixtures/invented_target_fixture.json`; it is invented public metadata used by `tests/test_handoff_export_workflow.py` to exercise schema shape, warnings, assumptions, provenance, and unsupported-target flags without resembling commercial-tool examples.
> - The generic exporter entry point is `core/handoff/exporter/workflow.py`. Package container structure, concrete mappings, target field coverage, and target-specific implementation remain gated.
>

### CLM-027 — Trade-offs

> ##### Trade-offs
>
> | Trade-off | Conservative direction |
> |---|---|
> | Generic exporter vs. target-specific parser | Prefer a generic exporter with explicit unsupported-target flags; defer target-specific parsing behavior. |
> | Strict schema validation vs. permissive export | Prefer schema validation and explicit findings over silent coercion. |
> | Helpful external metadata vs. professional status | Preserve references, notes, hashes, and diagnostics, but avoid approval/certification/status claims. |
> | Realistic fixture vs. protected/commercial data risk | Prefer invented fixture data with clear provenance. |
>

### CLM-028 — Examples

> ##### Examples
>
> The current example fixture is `fixtures/invented_target_fixture.json`. It is invented public metadata only and is checked by `tests/test_handoff_export_workflow.py` alongside schema validation for `schemas/handoff_package.schema.json` and `schemas/target_mapping.schema.json`.
>
> Do not derive future example values from protected standards, commercial software files, proprietary catalogs, owner standards, or private project data.
>

### CLM-029 — Open Questions and TBDs

> ##### Open Questions and TBDs
>
> | ID | Item | Source |
> |---|---|---|
> | DEL-15-03-TBD-001 | Canonical package container, concrete mappings, target field coverage, and target-specific implementation. | `SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` OI-015; DEL-17-01; DEL-17-02 |
> | DEL-15-03-TBD-002 | Target-specific parser/profile behavior and commercial-tool result ingestion remain out of this deliverable. | `_CONTEXT.md#Context Envelope`; OI-015 |
> | DEL-15-03-TBD-003 | Package-specific dependency versions and broader architecture implementation choices remain governed by architecture-basis TBDs. | `_CONTEXT.md#Architecture Basis Injection` |
