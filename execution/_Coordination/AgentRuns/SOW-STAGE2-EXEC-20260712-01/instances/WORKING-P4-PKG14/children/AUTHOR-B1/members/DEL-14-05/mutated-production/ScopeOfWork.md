# Scope of Work — DEL-14-05

## Purpose and Objective Traceability

This Scope of Work defines `DEL-14-05` in service of project scope [SOW-073] and package objectives [OBJ-016].

- **OUT-001** — A comparison mapping, unmatched-classification, tolerance-profile, and CSV, JSON, and report-section export contract is produced.

### CLM-005 — Conditions

> ##### Conditions
>
> | Condition | Status |
> |---|---|
> | Tolerance defaults | TBD. `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md#OI-014` states comparison tolerance defaults and mapping workflows are pending solver/result schema prototypes. |
> | Exact CSV fields | TBD. DEL-14-05 is assigned CSV export semantics, but the accessible sources do not define field names or column order. |
> | Exact JSON schema | TBD. The baseline is schema-first JSON, but the accessible sources do not include a deliverable-specific schema body. |
> | Report-section layout | TBD. Report sections must preserve privacy, provenance, units, diagnostics, limitations, and professional-boundary notices; final rendering and layout remain outside the accessible source slice. |
> | External validation | Excluded. PKG-14 does not ingest commercial prover outputs comprehensively or determine external validation. Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md#PKG-14`. |

### CLM-017 — Purpose

> ##### Purpose
>
> This procedure describes how to produce and verify the DEL-14-05 contract artifacts using only the current governed source basis. It is a setup-stage production procedure, not an implementation procedure for runtime comparison code.
>

### CLM-018 — Prerequisites

> ##### Prerequisites
>
> | Prerequisite | Source |
> |---|---|
> | Deliverable context for DEL-14-05 is present and readable. | `_CONTEXT.md` |
> | Accepted SOFTWARE_DECOMP revision 0.7 is available. | `_CONTEXT.md`; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` |
> | Governing project invariants are available. | `_REFERENCES.md`; `docs/CONTRACT.md`; `docs/TYPES.md`; `docs/SPEC.md`; `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md`; `docs/DIRECTIVE.md` |
> | Approved DAG-002 local mirror is present and preserved. | `_DEPENDENCIES.md`; `Dependencies.csv`; `execution/_DAG/DAG-006/APPROVAL_RECORD.md` |
> | Upstream architecture basis rows remain context evidence only. | `_CONTEXT.md#Architecture-Basis-Injection`; `_DEPENDENCIES.md#Authority-Boundary` |

> - result export prerequisite: DEL-08-04;
> - unit contract prerequisite: DEL-02-02.
>

### CLM-019 — Steps

> ##### Steps
>
> 1. Confirm scope identity from `_CONTEXT.md`: DEL-14-05, PKG-14, API_CONTRACT, SOW-073, OBJ-016.
> 2. Confirm decomposition scope from `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md`: DEL-14-05 defines manual mappings, unmatched classifications, tolerance profiles, and CSV/JSON/report-section export semantics.
> 3. Record exclusions before defining contract details: no comprehensive commercial prover result ingestion, no external validation decision, no professional approval state, and no protected/private data in public artifacts.
> 4. Define the comparison mapping schema surface at a contract level:
>    - stable source and target references;
>    - manual mapping evidence/provenance;
>    - relation to model-state and analysis-run comparison outputs;
>    - unresolved fields marked `TBD`.
> 5. Define the unmatched classification surface:
>    - explicit classification slot for entities/results without an accepted counterpart;
>    - specific enum values marked `TBD` unless later source material supplies them.
> 6. Define the tolerance profile surface:
>    - unit-aware comparison quantities and delta interpretation;
>    - required unit/dimensional metadata;
>    - tolerance default values marked `TBD`.
> 7. Define JSON export semantics:
>    - schema-first envelope basis;
>    - result set, model/run basis, solver version, unit-system reference, diagnostics, provenance, hashes or audit-manifest reference, analysis statuses, and professional-boundary notice;
>    - exact fields marked `TBD`.
> 8. Define CSV export semantics:
>    - parseable tabular representation for comparison review;
>    - no protected standards text, proprietary values, private project data, or private rule-pack payloads;
>    - columns and ordering marked `TBD`.
> 9. Define report-section export semantics:
>    - report-facing comparison evidence, limitations, diagnostics, assumptions, and professional-boundary notice;
>    - final layout marked `TBD`.
> 10. Verify the resulting contract draft against unit safety, data-boundary, professional-boundary, and no-silent-defaults invariants.
> 11. Preserve approved DAG-006 mirror rows as ACTIVE. Do not delete, retire, or reclassify them during setup handling.
>

### CLM-020 — Verification

> ##### Verification
>
> | Check | Expected result |
> |---|---|
> | Scope check | Contract content is limited to DEL-14-05 and does not implement DEL-14-03 or DEL-14-04 engines. |
> | Source-grounding check | Non-trivial requirements cite `_CONTEXT.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, decomposition, local dependency mirror, or referenced governance docs. |
> | TBD check | Unsupported details are marked `TBD` or `ASSUMPTION`; no engineering values are invented. |
> | Unit check | Unit-bearing comparison/export values are specified as unit-aware or diagnostic-producing. |
> | Boundary check | No professional approval, certification, code-compliance, or external-validation claim is introduced. |
> | IP/privacy check | No protected standards content, proprietary data, private project data, or private rule-pack payload is embedded. |
> | Dependency mirror check | Existing approved DAG-006 rows remain present and ACTIVE. |

### CLM-024 — Purpose

> ##### Purpose
>
> DEL-14-05 exists to define the comparison-facing contracts that let model-state and analysis-run comparison results be mapped, interpreted with tolerances, and exported for review without turning diagnostic comparison output into professional approval or external validation.
>
> Sources: `_CONTEXT.md`; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md#DEL-14-05`; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md#SOW-073`.
>

### CLM-025 — Principles

> ##### Principles
>
> | Principle | Guidance |
> |---|---|
> | Deterministic identity first | Stable IDs are the baseline for comparison. Manual mapping should be explicit evidence where stable-ID alignment is insufficient. Source: `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md#SOW-073`. |
> | Missing values stay visible | Tolerance defaults, mapping workflow details, and exact export field sets remain `TBD` where sources do not define them. Do not substitute engineering defaults. Source: `docs/CONTRACT.md#OPS-K-DATA-2`; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md#OI-014`. |
> | Units are contract data | Unit-normalized deltas still need explicit unit/dimensional metadata or diagnostics. Source: `docs/CONTRACT.md#OPS-K-UNIT-1`; `docs/SPEC.md#result-export-format`. |
> | Export is review evidence | Exports should carry enough context for review, regression comparison, report consumption, and downstream tooling without claiming external validation. Source: `docs/SPEC.md#result-export-format`; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md#SOW-073`. |
> | Professional authority remains human | Avoid terms or statuses that imply software certification, sealing, professional approval, authentication, or code compliance. Source: `docs/CONTRACT.md#OPS-K-AUTH-1`; `docs/TYPES.md#Analysis-status-vocabulary`. |
> | Public artifacts stay clean | Public examples and contract documentation must not embed protected standards text, protected tables, code-specific values, proprietary data, or private rule-pack payloads. Source: `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md#public-repository-must-not-contain`. |
>

### CLM-026 — Considerations

> ##### Considerations
>
> - The comparison mapping contract depends on upstream model-state and analysis-run identity surfaces. The local approved DAG-006 mirror records upstream dependencies on DEL-14-01 and DEL-14-02.
> - Unit-aware tolerance behavior depends on the unit-system contract. The local approved DAG-006 mirror records an upstream dependency on DEL-02-02.
> - Export semantics should remain compatible with result export envelopes. The local approved DAG-006 mirror records an upstream dependency on DEL-08-04.
> - Architecture basis rows in the local mirror are context evidence, not independent Type 2 dispatch authority.
> - The accessible sources do not define exact mapping enums, unmatched classification values, tolerance formulas, tolerance default values, CSV columns, JSON property names, or report-section layout. These remain `TBD`.
>

### CLM-027 — Trade-offs

> ##### Trade-offs
>
> | Trade-off | Direction |
> |---|---|
> | Strict schema versus future external result states | Prefer schema-first contracts with explicit extension/TBD slots because `_CONTEXT.md` notes that future external result states may be represented without changing core compare logic. |
> | Human readability versus machine validation | Preserve both reviewable export forms and schema validation hooks; exact CSV/report fields remain TBD until contract details are sourced. |
> | Default tolerances versus no silent defaults | Keep defaults TBD unless a future governed source supplies them. Silent tolerances would conflict with the no-silent-defaults principle. |
> | Broad external comparison support versus bounded MVP | Stay within deterministic state/run comparison and comparison export semantics; comprehensive commercial prover ingestion is excluded by PKG-14. |
>

### CLM-028 — Examples

> ##### Examples
>
> TBD. No locally accessible source provides approved example mappings, tolerance profiles, CSV rows, JSON payloads, or report-section examples for DEL-14-05.
>

### CLM-029 — Conflict Table (for human ruling)

> ##### Conflict Table (for human ruling)
>
> No source conflict requiring human ruling was identified during the P1/P2 setup pass. The main unresolved items are source gaps, recorded as `TBD`: tolerance defaults, mapping workflow details, exact export fields, and report-section layout.
