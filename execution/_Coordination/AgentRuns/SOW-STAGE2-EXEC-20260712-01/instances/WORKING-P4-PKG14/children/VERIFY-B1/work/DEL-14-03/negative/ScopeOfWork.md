# Scope of Work — DEL-14-03

## Purpose and Objective Traceability

This Scope of Work defines `DEL-14-03` in service of project scope [SOW-073, SOW-071] and package objectives [OBJ-016].

- **OUT-001** — A deterministic model-state comparison contract using stable IDs and explicit mappings to classify added, removed, changed, and unchanged entities is produced.

> | Verification area | Minimum check |
> |---|---|
> | Stable-ID matching | Reorder equivalent entity lists and confirm unchanged diff output. |
> | Added/removed classification | Compare fixtures with entities present in only one state. |

> - state comparison engine artifact or module path, `TBD` until implementation;
> - state diff tests;
> - notes identifying dependency on `DEL-14-01`, `DEL-14-05`, and `DEL-02-02`;

### CLM-016 — D-41 R5 T2B unit-comparison boundary (2026-07-12)

> ##### D-41 R5 T2B unit-comparison boundary (2026-07-12)
>
> DEL-14-03 performs structural state comparison, not unit conversion. A changed field declared unit-bearing must carry explicit unit and dimension metadata on both sides. Missing metadata, incompatible dimensions, or different units without a governed normalization contract block classification as a normal change. Same-unit/same-dimension values are preserved as structured left/right evidence; the engine does not emit a bare numeric delta.

- **AC-001** — The contract preserves immutable-state context, stable-ID-first matching, explicit rather than heuristic mappings, deterministic output, metadata and diagnostic preservation, structured unit/dimension blocking behavior without bare numeric deltas, invented/public-safe fixtures, the retained dependency-enum conflict and review residuals, and the separation from run comparison, export policy, external validation, or professional approval.

> Produce or use the model-state comparison engine in a way that remains deterministic, source-grounded, unit-aware where applicable, and bounded to diagnostic/audit comparison of immutable model states.
>

### CLM-020 — Prerequisites

> ##### Prerequisites
>
> | Prerequisite | Status / source |
> |---|---|
> | Immutable model-state record contract | Upstream dependency `DEL-14-01`; approved DAG-002 mirror row `DAG-002-E0792`. |
> | Mapping/tolerance contract | Upstream dependency `DEL-14-05`; approved DAG-002 mirror row `DAG-002-E0793`; details `TBD` per `OI-014`. |
> | Unit system and dimensional-analysis contract | Upstream dependency `DEL-02-02`; approved DAG-002 mirror row `DAG-002-E0794`. |
> | Architecture basis | `AB-00-01`, `AB-00-02`, `AB-00-03`, `AB-00-04`, `AB-00-06`, `AB-00-07`, and `AB-00-08` in `_CONTEXT.md`. |
> | Professional/IP boundary | `docs/CONTRACT.md`, `docs/DIRECTIVE.md`, and `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md`. |
>

### CLM-021 — Steps

> ##### Steps
>
> 1. Confirm the work is limited to `DEL-14-03` model-state entity diffs. Escalate if the task expands into analysis-run result deltas, export formats, GUI overlays, external prover status, or professional approval workflow.
>
> 2. Identify the immutable state input contract from `DEL-14-01`. If the contract is unavailable, record the input schema as `TBD` and do not invent entity fields.
>
> 3. Identify the comparison mapping contract from `DEL-14-05`. If unavailable, implement only stable-ID matching assumptions that are source-supported, and mark manual mapping behavior `TBD`.
>
> 4. Identify unit-bearing fields through the unit contract from `DEL-02-02`. Do not compare unit-bearing values as bare numbers; missing or incompatible unit metadata should produce diagnostics.
>
> 5. Define the comparison input envelope as two model-state references or payloads plus any explicit mapping/settings record. Exact service/API syntax is `TBD`.
>
> 6. Match entities by stable ID. Apply explicit mapping records where the mapping contract allows them. Treat unresolved correspondence as unmatched or diagnostic rather than hidden equivalence.
>
> 7. Classify entities into added, removed, changed, and unchanged categories. Exact field-level normalization and change significance rules are `TBD` pending state schema and mapping/tolerance contract detail.
>
> 8. Preserve review context: state hashes, warnings, unresolved assumptions, notes, external references, provenance, and diagnostics where present.
>
> 9. Return a deterministic result envelope with professional-boundary language. Do not emit automatic certification, sealing, code-compliance, external-validation, or human-approval statuses.
>
> 10. Build state diff tests using invented/public-safe fixtures. Cover stable-ID matching, added/removed/changed/unchanged classifications, mapping behavior once available, deterministic repeatability, unit metadata diagnostics, and forbidden-claim checks.
>

### CLM-022 — Verification

> ##### Verification
>
> | Check | Expected evidence |
> |---|---|
> | Stable-ID determinism | Repeated comparisons of the same fixtures produce identical classifications and result serialization where implemented. |
> | Mapping behavior | Explicit mappings produce expected correspondence; missing mappings remain visible. `TBD` until `DEL-14-05` exists. |
> | Changed classification | Source-supported relevant field changes are reported as changed. Exact normalization policy is `TBD`. |
> | Unit metadata | Unit-bearing fields require unit/dimension context or produce diagnostics. |
> | Metadata preservation | Warnings, assumptions, external references, notes, provenance, and hashes are not silently dropped. |
> | Boundary language | No result label claims professional acceptance, code compliance, certification, sealing, authentication, or external validation. |
> | Fixture governance | Test fixtures are invented/public-safe and do not include protected standards text, proprietary values, or private project data. |
>

### CLM-023 — Records

> ##### Records
>
> - Implementation/module path: `TBD`.
> - State comparison service or engine contract: `TBD`.
> - State diff test artifact path: `TBD`.
> - Fixture provenance notes: `TBD`.
> - Dependency notes: preserve the existing DAG-002 mirror rows as ACTIVE unless a future approved coordination workflow changes the mirror.

### CLM-024 — D-41 R5 T2B unit check (2026-07-12)

> ##### D-41 R5 T2B unit check (2026-07-12)
>
> For every changed field listed in `unit_bearing_fields`, require unit and dimension on both sides; block missing metadata, dimension mismatch, and unnormalized unit mismatch; confirm accepted same-unit changes retain full left/right records and contain no derived bare-number delta.

- **VER-001** — Validate the contract and review source parity, stable-ID and mapping behavior, all four classifications, deterministic repeatability, state metadata preservation, missing/incompatible/unnormalized unit diagnostics, retained conflict and TBDs, fixture governance, deliverable boundaries, and prohibited authority claims.

### CLM-027 — Purpose

### CLM-028 — Principles

> ##### Principles
>
> | Principle | Guidance |
> |---|---|
> | Stable identity first | Treat stable IDs and typed references as the primary comparison surface. Positional or display-name matching is an implementation risk unless explicitly justified by a mapping contract. |
> | Explicit mappings | When two states intentionally refer to corresponding entities with different IDs, use explicit mapping records. Do not infer hidden engineering equivalence from proximity, naming, or apparent similarity without a source-backed rule. |
> | Deterministic output | The same inputs should produce the same classifications and serialized result shape. Hashing or canonical serialization details are governed by the persistence/hash basis where JSON payloads are involved. |
> | No silent defaults | Missing mappings, missing units, unsupported entity categories, and unresolved assumptions should become diagnostics or `TBD`, not implicit acceptance. |
> | Metadata preservation | Notes, warnings, external references, unresolved assumptions, provenance, and hashes attached to model states are part of the review context. |
> | Boundary clarity | The comparison is diagnostic/audit functionality. It must not imply professional review, code compliance, external prover approval, or certification. |
>
> Sources: `docs/DIRECTIVE.md` sections 2.2 and 3; `docs/CONTRACT.md` invariants `OPS-K-DATA-2`, `OPS-K-AUTH-1`, `OPS-K-MECH-2`; `docs/SPEC.md` sections 4, 4.3, and 4.4.
>

### CLM-029 — Considerations

> ##### Considerations
>
> | Topic | Consideration |
> |---|---|
> | Model-state versus analysis-run comparison | `DEL-14-03` is scoped to model-state diffs. Analysis-run result deltas are separately assigned to `DEL-14-04`; mapping/tolerance/export contracts are assigned to `DEL-14-05`. |
> | Tolerances | Comparison tolerance defaults and mapping workflows are an open issue (`OI-014`). Treat detailed tolerance behavior as `TBD` until resolved. |
> | Unit-normalized values | SOW-073 mentions unit-normalized result deltas, but the unit contract dependency (`DEL-02-02`) and comparison contract dependency (`DEL-14-05`) must be honored before numeric comparison policy is finalized. |
> | Entity granularity | The exact model entity categories are `TBD` until the immutable state schema and canonical domain model detail are available. |
> | Fixture content | Tests should use invented/public-safe fixtures and should carry provenance status. Do not import protected standards examples or proprietary project data. |
> | Context size | The deliverable has an `L` context envelope and WATCH risk; scope should be split or escalated if it expands beyond deterministic model-state entity diffs. |
>

### CLM-030 — Trade-offs

> ##### Trade-offs
>
> | Trade-off | Direction |
> |---|---|
> | Strict stable-ID matching vs. heuristic matching | Prefer strict stable-ID matching. Use explicit mapping records for intentional correspondence. Heuristics are `TBD` and require human-approved scope if introduced. |
> | Rich diff payload vs. bounded backend slice | Start with source-supported classifications and diagnostic metadata. Defer UI overlays, report formatting, and export semantics to their owning deliverables. |
> | Canonical hash comparison vs. field-level comparison | Hashes support reproducibility, but field-level changed classification needs a source-defined normalization policy. The exact field comparison policy remains `TBD`. |
> | Numeric tolerance vs. exact equality | Numeric tolerance policy is not yet source-defined for this deliverable. Unit and tolerance dependencies must be resolved before implementation claims are made. |
>

### CLM-031 — Examples

> ##### Examples
>
> Source-grounded example categories are limited to:
>
> - an entity appears only in the later state: added;
> - an entity appears only in the earlier state: removed;
> - an entity appears in both states with the same stable ID or explicit mapping and no relevant difference: unchanged;
> - an entity appears in both states with the same stable ID or explicit mapping and a source-supported relevant difference: changed.
>
> Concrete fixture entities, fields, values, units, tolerances, and mapping records are `TBD` until the state schema and mapping/tolerance contract are available.
