# Scope of Work — DEL-14-01

## Purpose and Objective Traceability

This Scope of Work defines `DEL-14-01` in service of project scope [SOW-071] and package objectives [OBJ-016].

- **OUT-001** — An immutable model-state record contract for named, read-only snapshots with flexible review metadata, explicit payload-scoped hashes, and reproducible persistence is produced.

### CLM-005 — Conditions

> ##### Conditions
>
> - The deliverable belongs to a schema-first architecture baseline: Rust core/application services, JSON Schema 2020-12 contracts, schema-first command/query/job result envelopes, and JCS-compatible canonical JSON hash basis where JSON payloads are hashed (`_CONTEXT.md`, Architecture Basis Injection).
> - The model state record must respect OpenPipeStress data-boundary invariants: protected standards text, copied tables, proprietary values, and private project/rule data must not be committed publicly by default (`docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-IP-1, OPS-K-PRIV-1; `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md` sections 3 and 6).
> - Missing or unsupported data remains explicit and visible; silent engineering defaults are disallowed (`docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-DATA-2; `docs/DIRECTIVE.md` section 3).
> - Human acceptance or external approval, if referenced later, remains external and hash-bound; the software must not emit professional approval, certification, sealing, authentication, or code-compliance equivalents as automatic statuses (`docs/SPEC.md` sections 4.4 and 9; `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-AUTH-1 and OPS-K-AUTH-2).
> - Approved DAG-002 mirror rows identify architecture-basis predecessors plus dependencies on canonical model, persistence, audit/hash, and analysis-status vocabulary surfaces (`Dependencies.csv`; `execution/_DAG/DAG-006/APPROVAL_RECORD.md`).
>

### CLM-017 — Purpose

> ##### Purpose
>
> Define and verify the immutable model state record surface for DEL-14-01 without expanding into analysis-run records, comparison engines, handoff workflows, or professional approval states.
>

### CLM-018 — Prerequisites

> ##### Prerequisites
>
> - Read `_CONTEXT.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, and `Dependencies.csv` in this deliverable folder.
> - Use `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` revision 0.7 for SOW-071, OBJ-016, PKG-14, and DEL-14-01 scope.
> - Apply `docs/CONTRACT.md`, `docs/DIRECTIVE.md`, `docs/SPEC.md`, `docs/TYPES.md`, and `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md` for governance, technical, vocabulary, and data-boundary constraints.
> - Treat approved DAG-006 rows as coordination evidence, not as authorization to edit upstream deliverables or dispatch Type 2 implementation.
> - Preserve all unknown implementation choices as `TBD` unless a later accepted source resolves them.
>
> Declared upstream coordination evidence from the local mirror:
>
> | Target | Meaning for this deliverable |
> |---|---|
> | DEL-00-01 through DEL-00-04, DEL-00-06 through DEL-00-08 | Architecture basis context for downstream work. |
> | DEL-02-01 | Canonical model schema predecessor; model states snapshot the canonical model. |
> | DEL-02-05 | Persistence and serialization predecessor. |
> | DEL-08-02 | Audit manifest and model hash predecessor. |
> | DEL-05-04 | Analysis-state/status vocabulary predecessor. |
>

### CLM-019 — Steps

> ##### Steps
>
> 1. Confirm the implementation task is scoped only to DEL-14-01 and `schemas/model_state.schema.json` plus persistence tests.
> 2. Define the model state schema fields only from source-supported categories: name, tags, notes, external references, unresolved assumptions, warnings, deterministic hash metadata, snapshot identity, and source/payload references.
> 3. Mark exact schema property names, required/optional cardinality, hash partitioning, hash library, and persistence API entry points as `TBD` until implementation evidence exists.
> 4. Apply JSON Schema 2020-12 as the schema/interchange baseline.
> 5. Apply the accepted JCS-compatible canonical JSON basis for JSON payload hashes and record payload scope explicitly.
> 6. Add or update persistence tests that demonstrate save/load behavior, stable metadata, read-only snapshot behavior, deterministic hash metadata, and no silent default insertion.
> 7. Add checks or fixtures only with invented or cleared public data; do not include protected standards text, proprietary vendor data, owner standards, private project values, or code-specific values.
> 8. Ensure no automatic professional approval, certification, sealing, authentication, external-prover approval, or code-compliance status is introduced.
> 9. Record all unresolved implementation decisions and unsupported source assumptions in deliverable notes or test evidence.
>

### CLM-020 — Verification

> ##### Verification
>
> - Schema validation passes for the model state schema once implemented.
> - Persistence tests pass and demonstrate stable round-trip behavior.
> - Hash tests demonstrate deterministic behavior for JSON payloads under the selected canonicalization method.
> - Tests or schema checks preserve assumptions, warnings, external references, and provenance-bearing metadata.
> - Protected-content/private-data review finds no bundled protected standards data, proprietary values, or private project/rule data in public fixtures.
> - Review confirms the deliverable does not claim professional approval or external validation.
>

### CLM-021 — Records

> ##### Records
>
> - `schemas/model_state.schema.json`
> - model state persistence test files and outputs
> - hash determinism test evidence
> - protected-content/private-data review evidence for fixtures
> - unresolved `TBD` decision list for implementation choices not source-supported in this setup pass

- **VER-001** — Validate the contract and review source parity, immutable snapshot and metadata coverage, payload-scope and deterministic-hash boundaries, round-trip/no-silent-default intent, external-reference privacy screening residuals, public-fixture controls, retained TBDs, and professional-authority limits.

>

### CLM-024 — Purpose

> ##### Purpose
>
> Immutable model state records give OpenPipeStress a reproducible saved-state surface for design iteration, comparison, reporting, and handoff workflows. The deliverable is a schema/data-model change, not a professional approval workflow.
>
> Sources: `_CONTEXT.md`; OBJ-016 and PKG-14 in `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md`; `docs/SPEC.md` sections 4.4 and 9.
>

### CLM-025 — Principles

> ##### Principles
>
> - Treat the model state as a saved snapshot record, not as a mutable "current model" alias.
> - Keep flexible review metadata such as names, tags, notes, external references, unresolved assumptions, and warnings explicit.
> - Bind reproducibility to deterministic hashes with explicit payload scope; do not imply that a hash proves engineering correctness.
> - Preserve the separation between mechanics/software evidence and human professional reliance.
> - Keep protected standards data, owner standards, proprietary vendor data, and private project data out of public examples and fixtures unless separately reviewed and cleared.
> - Prefer `TBD` over invented schema details when exact property names, cardinality, hash partitioning, or persistence APIs are not source-supported.
>

### CLM-026 — Considerations

> ##### Considerations
>
> The accepted architecture basis makes this deliverable schema-first and hash-aware, but it does not yet select exact dependency versions, physical project package/container details, or package-specific implementation choices (`_CONTEXT.md`, Architecture Basis Injection). Those choices should remain explicit implementation `TBD`s until a later authorized task resolves them.
>
> The local DAG-002 mirror identifies several upstream evidence surfaces: architecture-basis deliverables, canonical model schema, project persistence/serialization, audit manifest/model hash, and analysis-status vocabulary. These rows are coordination evidence only; they do not dispatch implementation work or authorize lifecycle promotion (`Dependencies.csv`; `execution/_DAG/DAG-006/APPROVAL_RECORD.md`).
>
> The model state should not borrow formal prover-status language. SOW-071 and the context budget note both state that model states are flexible metadata records, not formal prover approval states.
>

### CLM-027 — Trade-offs

> ##### Trade-offs
>
> | Topic | Conservative setup position |
> |---|---|
> | Metadata flexibility vs. formal status lifecycle | Support flexible names, tags, notes, references, assumptions, and warnings; avoid hard-coded external approval statuses. |
> | Hashing precision vs. premature implementation choice | Require deterministic hash metadata and payload scope, but leave exact implementation library and non-JSON partitioning TBD. |
> | Snapshot immutability vs. persistence mechanics | Specify read-only snapshot semantics; defer the exact enforcement mechanism to implementation. |
> | External references vs. private-data risk | Permit explicit references while preserving privacy/protected-content checks and avoiding embedded private payloads. |
>

### CLM-028 — Examples

> ##### Examples
>
> No concrete example payload is source-supported in the accessible material. Future examples should use invented or cleared public data, document provenance, and avoid protected standards text or proprietary project values.
>

### CLM-029 — Conflict Table (for human ruling)

> ##### Conflict Table (for human ruling)
>
> | Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A (file + section) | Source B (file + section) | Impacted sections | Proposed authority (PROPOSAL) | Human ruling |
> |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> | None recorded | No direct source conflict identified during setup. | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
