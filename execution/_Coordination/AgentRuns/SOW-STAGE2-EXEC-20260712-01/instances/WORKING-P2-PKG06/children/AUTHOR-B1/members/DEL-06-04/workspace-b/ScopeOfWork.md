# Scope of Work — DEL-06-04

## Purpose and Objective Traceability

This migration candidate defines `DEL-06-04` in service of project scope [SOW-042] and package objectives [OBJ-002, OBJ-005].

- **OUT-001** — A private rule-pack lifecycle and checksum contract covering stable identity and version, source/provenance notice, redistribution and quarantine status, canonical JSON/JCS-compatible payload hashing, non-JSON manifest hashes, diagnostics, and report/audit references is produced for the declared scope and objectives.

## Deliverable Definition — Ontology

### CLM-003 — Attributes

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Datasheet.md","line_end":27,"line_start":16,"source_sha256":"842823f33ec11a9d374ba92c12698ffca75571735b6ddcec550c5f8430908a80","target_id":"CLM-003"} -->
##### Attributes

| Attribute | Setup value |
|---|---|
| Rule-pack boundary | Rule packs are user-owned or private design-basis artifacts; public project content is limited to schemas, mechanics, workflows, and invented examples. |
| Lifecycle subject | Version identity, source/provenance notes, public/private or redistribution status, checksum metadata, and audit/report references for rule packs. |
| Checksum basis | JSON rule-pack payloads use canonical JSON with JCS-compatible canonicalization before hashing. Non-JSON or binary assets require manifest-level hashes and an explicit payload reference. |
| Required checksum metadata | Algorithm, canonicalization where applicable, payload reference, checksum value, and statement of what was hashed. |
| Redistribution status | Must be explicit. Supported values are owned by the rule-pack schema deliverable; project sources require at least private, public-permissive, unknown, and suspected-protected handling. |
| Public repository posture | Private rule-pack content, licensed standards text, copied formulas, proprietary tables, owner requirements, and vendor data without redistribution rights are not committed publicly. |
| Report posture | Reports may reference rule-pack ID/name, version, checksum, and source note without exposing protected formulas or private values in public templates. |

### CLM-004 — Conditions

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Datasheet.md","line_end":38,"line_start":28,"source_sha256":"842823f33ec11a9d374ba92c12698ffca75571735b6ddcec550c5f8430908a80","target_id":"CLM-004"} -->
##### Conditions

| Condition | Constraint |
|---|---|
| Protected data | Do not include protected standards text, tables, figures, examples, copied code formulas, material allowables, SIF/flexibility tables, dimensional standards, or proprietary vendor data. |
| Private data | Private rule packs remain user-controlled and are not transmitted, exported, or committed by default. |
| Professional responsibility | Rule-pack evaluation is software decision support using user data. It is not certification, sealing, approval, endorsement, or a code-compliance claim. |
| Unit awareness | Rule-pack values and evaluator inputs must remain unit-aware where numeric quantities are involved; missing required units or values are findings, not silent defaults. |
| Architecture basis | SCA-001 requires JSON Schema 2020-12 contracts, schema-first command/query/job result envelopes, and canonical JSON/JCS-compatible hash basis where JSON payloads are hashed. |
| Deferred decisions | Private storage location, encryption defaults, access-control policy defaults, permission grant persistence, and physical project container are deferred to PKG-12/PKG-02 architecture decisions unless separately approved. |

### CLM-005 — Construction

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Datasheet.md","line_end":48,"line_start":39,"source_sha256":"842823f33ec11a9d374ba92c12698ffca75571735b6ddcec550c5f8430908a80","target_id":"CLM-005"} -->
##### Construction

This setup surface describes the future implementation contract without creating implementation files. A later implementation task for DEL-06-04 should produce a local lifecycle and checksum mechanism that:

- records rule-pack identity, version, source notice, redistribution/private status, checksum metadata, and review/quarantine disposition;
- binds checksum values to explicit payload references rather than environment-local paths or volatile session state;
- records diagnostics for missing provenance, missing redistribution status, stale hashes, suspected protected content, and attempts to expose private content publicly;
- exposes audit-manifest hooks for reports and reproducibility artifacts without embedding private rule-pack formulas or values in public templates;
- defers storage location, encryption, and access-control defaults to the security/privacy package.

##### Scope

This deliverable defines the setup contract for private rule-pack lifecycle and checksum handling in PKG-06. It covers metadata, lifecycle guardrails, checksum handling, audit/report hooks, and diagnostics needed to keep rule packs versioned, source-noted, checksum-addressed, and marked for redistribution/private status.

This setup does not implement registry modules, schemas, tests, encryption, private storage, access-control defaults, or private rule-pack content.

##### Standards

No engineering code or standards-body requirement is implemented by this setup deliverable. Applicable project governance sources are:

- OPS-K-RULE-3: rule packs are versioned, checksummed, source-noted, and marked public/private.
- OPS-K-DATA-1/2/3: code-specific values are user-supplied/private, missing values are findings, and values carry provenance.
- OPS-K-PRIV-1/2: private data is not committed or transmitted publicly by default; telemetry is off by default and cannot include private engineering/code data.
- OPS-K-IP-1/2/3: protected content is excluded, provenance is required for public data, and suspected protected content is quarantined.
- OPS-K-UNIT-1: calculations, formulas, imported values, and exports are unit-aware and dimensionally checked.
- OPS-K-AGENT-1..4: no invented engineering values, gaps surfaced, sealed scope respected, outputs draft until accepted.

##### Purpose

This procedure describes how a future bounded implementation task should produce private rule-pack lifecycle and checksum handling while preserving the public/private data boundary. It also records how this setup run should be verified.

<!-- sow-source-end -->

### CLM-017 — Prerequisites

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Procedure.md","line_end":15,"line_start":7,"source_sha256":"2bea57ed01c01bba5d4287c981ff61e7dd80ae2c7b50b49715528837e81dcc42","target_id":"CLM-017"} -->
##### Prerequisites

- Read and apply INIT.md, AGENTS.md, docs/CONTRACT.md, docs/SPEC.md, docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md, docs/PRD.md, and the DEL-06-04 sealed context.
- Confirm the implementation task has an explicit write scope before editing code, schemas, registry modules, or tests.
- Treat DEL-06-01 rule-pack schema as an upstream schema source for final field names and enum ownership.
- Treat DEL-08-02 audit manifest/model hash as a downstream consumer of rule-pack checksum metadata.
- Treat PKG-12 security/privacy deliverables as the owner for private storage locations, encryption/access defaults, telemetry, redaction, and secret handling.
- Do not use or create real private rule-pack payloads in public repository artifacts.

<!-- sow-source-end -->

### CLM-018 — Steps

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Procedure.md","line_end":48,"line_start":16,"source_sha256":"2bea57ed01c01bba5d4287c981ff61e7dd80ae2c7b50b49715528837e81dcc42","target_id":"CLM-018"} -->
##### Steps

1. Establish the rule-pack lifecycle metadata boundary.
   - Include identity, version, source notice, redistribution/private status, checksum metadata, diagnostics, and review/quarantine disposition.
   - Do not embed protected code text, copied formulas, private values, or proprietary tables.

2. Define checksum payload boundaries.
   - For JSON payloads, use canonical JSON with JCS-compatible canonicalization before hashing.
   - Record algorithm, canonicalization, payload reference, and checksum value.
   - For non-JSON or binary assets, create a manifest-level hash entry and mark unresolved partition details as `TBD`.

3. Define stale-check and lifecycle diagnostics.
   - Missing source note, missing redistribution status, missing checksum, stale checksum, suspected protected content, and attempted public export of private content must be explicit diagnostics.
   - Missing rule-check-required values or units remain rule/check findings, not defaulted values.

4. Connect audit/report hooks.
   - Provide report-facing references to rule-pack ID/name, version, checksum, and source note.
   - Public templates must not render private formulas, protected tables, or copied standards text.

5. Preserve professional-boundary wording.
   - Do not emit `CODE_COMPLIANT`, certification, approval, sealing, endorsement, or equivalent professional reliance language.
   - Keep human acceptance external and hash-bound if it is introduced by later work.

6. Defer private storage and access decisions.
   - Record storage location, encryption defaults, access-control policy, permission persistence, and credential handling as `TBD` or PKG-12-owned unless the sealed brief explicitly authorizes them.

7. Verify setup artifacts for this run.
   - Confirm the four documents exist.
   - Confirm semantic matrix and lensing artifacts exist.
   - Validate `Dependencies.csv` with the v3.1 schema validator.
   - Check dependency enum fields with `validate_enum.py`.
   - Confirm `_STATUS.md` remains `SEMANTIC_READY` only after all setup gates pass.

## Governing Values and Decisions — Axiology

### CLM-022 — Guidance: DEL-06-04 Private rule-pack lifecycle and checksum handling

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":2,"line_start":1,"source_sha256":"b1ec2b1a528bf1cf3067e89863510023d4ffcb66b10dccb5c07da2739b627f1a","target_id":"CLM-022"} -->
#### Guidance: DEL-06-04 Private rule-pack lifecycle and checksum handling

<!-- sow-source-end -->

### CLM-023 — Purpose

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":6,"line_start":3,"source_sha256":"b1ec2b1a528bf1cf3067e89863510023d4ffcb66b10dccb5c07da2739b627f1a","target_id":"CLM-023"} -->
##### Purpose

DEL-06-04 exists to keep rule-pack lifecycle and checksum behavior auditable without putting protected or private rule-pack content into the public repository. The future implementation should let users reference and validate their own design bases while preserving the code-neutral, private-data boundary.

<!-- sow-source-end -->

### CLM-024 — Principles

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":15,"line_start":7,"source_sha256":"b1ec2b1a528bf1cf3067e89863510023d4ffcb66b10dccb5c07da2739b627f1a","target_id":"CLM-024"} -->
##### Principles

- Treat the checksum as evidence about a specific payload, not as proof of engineering correctness.
- Treat privacy and redistribution status as explicit metadata, not an inference from file location.
- Prefer source notes and provenance over embedded protected text.
- Keep lifecycle diagnostics visible: missing provenance, missing checksum, stale checksum, private-data export attempts, and suspected protected content are findings.
- Preserve the mechanics/rule/professional boundary: a user-rule check is not professional approval.
- Keep storage, encryption, access policy, and secret handling decisions out of this deliverable unless the human project authority records a later architecture decision.

| JCS basis | For JSON rule-pack payloads, canonicalize with the project-selected JCS-compatible basis before hashing. Record `algorithm`, `canonicalization`, `payload_ref`, and `value`. |
| Payload boundary | A hash must state what was hashed. Do not hash local paths, timestamps, UI state, or other volatile fields as reproducibility evidence unless excluded or documented in a manifest. |
| Private marking | A rule pack with unknown redistribution rights should not be treated as public. The safer state is private or unknown until reviewed. |
| Protected suspected | Suspected protected standards or proprietary content should trigger quarantine/human review rather than public commit. |
| Audit hooks | Reports and exports should identify rule-pack name or ID, version, checksum, and source note. They should not expose private formulas or protected tables in public templates. |
| Unit metadata | Rule-pack values used for numeric evaluation need units or dimension metadata where applicable. Missing units should block or warn rather than default silently. |
| Deferred architecture | Private storage directories, encryption defaults, access grants, revocation, and credential handling belong to PKG-12 and persistence decisions. |

### CLM-026 — Trade-offs

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":36,"line_start":28,"source_sha256":"b1ec2b1a528bf1cf3067e89863510023d4ffcb66b10dccb5c07da2739b627f1a","target_id":"CLM-026"} -->
##### Trade-offs

| Trade-off | Direction for this setup |
|---|---|
| Strong reproducibility vs. privacy | Reference hashes and source notes without publishing private payloads. |
| Detailed source trace vs. protected-content risk | Store source notices and provenance summaries; do not copy licensed text or tables into public artifacts. |
| Local-first convenience vs. governed export | Keep private data local by default; require explicit export/report decisions for any exposure. |
| Schema stability vs. implementation detail | Record metadata and lifecycle expectations now; leave enum finalization and module contracts to implementation/schema deliverables. |

### CLM-027 — Examples

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":55,"line_start":37,"source_sha256":"b1ec2b1a528bf1cf3067e89863510023d4ffcb66b10dccb5c07da2739b627f1a","target_id":"CLM-027"} -->
##### Examples

Safe public examples for this deliverable may show metadata shape only, using invented placeholders such as:

```yaml
rule_pack_ref:
  id: "invented-demo-only"
  version: "0.1.0"
  source_notice: "Invented demonstration values only"
  redistribution_status: "public_permissive"
  checksum:
    algorithm: "sha256"
    canonicalization: "JCS"
    payload_ref: "rule_pack"
    value: "TBD"
```

Private or protected formulas, allowables, code text, tables, and owner design-basis values must not be substituted into public examples.

### CLM-028 — Conflict Table (for human ruling)

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":61,"line_start":56,"source_sha256":"b1ec2b1a528bf1cf3067e89863510023d4ffcb66b10dccb5c07da2739b627f1a","target_id":"CLM-028"} -->
##### Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted sections | Proposed authority (PROPOSAL) | Human ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C-06-04-001 | Exact private storage location, encryption default, and access-control policy are required for implementation but out of scope for this deliverable. | DEL-06-04 context notes: access control details defer to PKG-12 | docs/PRD.md Section 18.3 lists optional encrypted storage | Datasheet Conditions; Specification R-06-04-011; Procedure Prerequisites | Defer to PKG-12 and persistence architecture; do not decide here. | TBD |
| C-06-04-002 | Exact schema enum set for redistribution/private status is not finalized by this deliverable. | docs/SPEC.md Section 6 uses `private`, `public_permissive`, `unknown` | docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md includes `private_only` and `protected_suspected` for data records | Specification R-06-04-003; Datasheet Attributes | Record minimum lifecycle need and defer final enum ownership to DEL-06-01/schema work. | TBD |
