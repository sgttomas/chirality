# Scope of Work — DEL-06-03

## Purpose and Objective Traceability

This Scope of Work defines `DEL-06-03` in service of project scope [SOW-004] and package objectives [OBJ-002, OBJ-005].

- **OUT-001** — A required-input-completeness contract connecting declarative rule-pack requirements to project, model, and user-supplied data, with explicit missing, unit-incompatible, unprovenanced, and rule-check-blocking findings, is produced for the declared scope and objectives.

### CLM-004 — Attributes

> ##### Attributes
>
> | Attribute | Source-grounded value |
> |---|---|
> | Primary behavior | Identify missing rule-pack-required user inputs and prevent rule-check status from advancing when those inputs are absent. |
> | Protected-data boundary | The checker must not bundle protected standards text, code tables, allowables, SIF/flexibility factors, proprietary formulas, or code-specific defaults. |
> | User-data boundary | Code-specific and project-specific values remain user-supplied or privately imported data with provenance. |
> | Status vocabulary | The relevant analysis state is `RULE_INPUTS_INCOMPLETE`; software must not emit automatic `CODE_COMPLIANT` status. |
> | Warning class | Missing rule-pack input is a `RULE_CHECK_BLOCKING` condition, distinct from solve-blocking physical data. |
> | Professional boundary | Checker output is a software finding; professional acceptance remains outside solver/rule code. |
>

### CLM-005 — Conditions

> ##### Conditions
>
> | Condition | Handling |
> |---|---|
> | Required code/project input missing | Emit an explicit missing-input finding and block user-rule-check completion. |
> | Required physical input missing | Keep classified separately as solve-blocking, not rule-check-blocking. |
> | Input exists but provenance is absent or weak | Surface provenance warning; do not silently accept as reliable. |
> | Rule pack requests protected bundled data | Treat as data-boundary/IP issue and escalate rather than fill a default. |
> | Completeness cannot be determined | Mark as `TBD` or equivalent unresolved finding; do not infer engineering values. |
>

### CLM-006 — Construction

> ##### Construction
>
> The setup artifact defines the future feature boundary only. It does not create executable completeness rules, code formulas, material allowables, design-code tables, or checker implementation files.
>
> The future implementation is expected to consume a rule-pack schema contract from DEL-06-01, analysis-status semantics from DEL-05-04, and diagnostics/result-envelope constraints from the architecture basis. Those dependencies are recorded as information-flow dependencies, not as schedule decisions.

### CLM-010 — Scope

> ##### Scope
>
> This deliverable specifies the setup boundary for a required-input completeness checker for user-defined rule packs. The future checker must connect a rule pack's declared required inputs to project/model/user-supplied data and prevent a user-rule-check status from being reported when required rule-check data is missing.
>
> This setup run does not implement code, schemas, executable completeness rules, code-specific formulas, allowables, or standards-derived defaults.
>

### CLM-011 — Requirements

> ##### Requirements
>
> | ID | Requirement | Source basis | Verification approach |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | R-DEL-06-03-001 | Missing rule-check-required values must be explicit findings, never silent defaults. | `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-DATA-2; `docs/DIRECTIVE.md` no silent engineering defaults | Future unit tests for missing required inputs and explicit findings. |
> | R-DEL-06-03-002 | Code-specific and project-specific values must be user-supplied or privately imported, not bundled as public defaults. | `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-DATA-1; `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md` private user data | Protected-content and default-data review of checker fixtures. |
> | R-DEL-06-03-003 | Rule-pack values, materials, components, SIF/flexibility factors, allowables, and related inputs must carry provenance where relied upon. | `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-DATA-3; `docs/TYPES.md` provenance labels | Schema/provenance validation in future feature tests. |
> | R-DEL-06-03-004 | Completeness must be machine-checkable from declarative rule-pack input declarations, not arbitrary executable code. | SOW-004; `docs/SPEC.md` rule-pack `required_inputs`; OPS-K-RULE-2 | Future tests bind rule-pack required-input declarations to missing-input diagnostics without executing arbitrary code. |
> | R-DEL-06-03-005 | Missing rule-pack input must map to a rule-check-blocking condition distinct from solve-blocking physical input. | `docs/SPEC.md` warning classes; `docs/TYPES.md` `RULE_INPUTS_INCOMPLETE` | Status/diagnostic tests verify `RULE_CHECK_BLOCKING` classification. |
> | R-DEL-06-03-006 | The checker must not assert code compliance, certification, approval, sealing, or professional reliance. | OPS-K-AUTH-1; `docs/TYPES.md` analysis-status vocabulary | Report/API text review and future status tests exclude automatic `CODE_COMPLIANT`. |
> | R-DEL-06-03-007 | Suspected protected or proprietary data requests must be surfaced and escalated, not translated into public data. | OPS-K-IP-1/2/3; `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md` quarantine rule | Protected-content lint and quarantine-path tests in later implementation. |
>

### CLM-012 — Standards

> ##### Standards
>
> No standards-body formulas, allowables, tables, text, examples, or code-specific interpretations are included in this setup artifact. Any future private project use of licensed standards data must remain user-controlled and provenance-marked.
>

### CLM-013 — External Inputs

> ##### External Inputs
>
> | Input | Required from | Notes |
> |---|---|---|
> | Rule-pack schema required-input declarations | DEL-06-01 Rule-pack schema | Needed before executable completeness checking can be implemented. |
> | Analysis status semantics | DEL-05-04 Analysis status semantics | Needed to bind missing inputs to `RULE_INPUTS_INCOMPLETE` without compliance claims. |
> | Diagnostics/result envelope contract | Architecture basis AB-00-06 | Needed for `RULE_CHECK_BLOCKING` findings and remediation text. |
> | User/project rule data | User-controlled private rule pack/project files | Must not be bundled into the public repository by this deliverable. |
>

### CLM-014 — Verification

> ##### Verification
>
> Future implementation verification must include:
>
> - rule-pack missing-input tests using invented/non-code data only;
> - unit-aware binding checks where the rule-pack schema declares dimensions or units;
> - tests that missing code/project inputs block rule-check status but do not block the mechanics solve status by default;
> - tests that no protected defaults, code-specific formulas, or material allowables are shipped;
> - tests that output messages preserve the professional responsibility boundary.
>

### CLM-015 — Documentation

> ##### Documentation
>
> Required setup artifacts for this deliverable are:
>
> - `Datasheet.md`
> - `Specification.md`
> - `Guidance.md`
> - `Procedure.md`
> - `_SEMANTIC.md`
> - `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md`
> - `Dependencies.csv`
> - `_DEPENDENCIES.md`
> - `_run_records/*`
> - `_STATUS.md`
>
> Implementation artifacts listed in the register (`rule completeness checker`, `tests`) remain future work outside this setup session's write scope.

- **AC-001** — The contract preserves the accepted separation between solve-blocking physical inputs and rule-check-required data, explicit no-default behavior, private user-data and protected-content boundaries, and professional responsibility, while retaining the expression grammar/library decision as TBD and inventing no engineering values.

>

### CLM-019 — Prerequisites

> ##### Prerequisites
>
> | Prerequisite | Status for setup | Notes |
> |---|---|---|
> | Sealed DEL-06-03 context | Available | `_CONTEXT.md` identifies SOW-004, OBJ-002, and OBJ-005. |

>

### CLM-020 — Steps

> ##### Steps
>
> 1. Confirm the deliverable identity and scope match `DEL-06-03`, `PKG-06`, and SOW-004.
> 2. Preserve the protected-data boundary by excluding standards text, tables, code formulas, allowables, SIF/flexibility data, vendor proprietary data, and private rule-pack content.
> 3. Define required checker behavior in terms of declarative required-input metadata, missing-input findings, provenance expectations, and status gating.
> 4. Keep solve-required missing data separate from rule-check-required missing data.
> 5. Require future tests to verify that missing rule-pack inputs produce `RULE_CHECK_BLOCKING` / `RULE_INPUTS_INCOMPLETE` behavior without asserting professional compliance.
> 6. Record dependencies on schema/status/diagnostic contracts in `Dependencies.csv`.
> 7. Leave implementation code, checker modules, schemas, and tests untouched for this setup-only run.
>

### CLM-021 — Verification

> ##### Verification
>
> For this setup run, verify:
>
> - the four-document kit exists;
> - `_SEMANTIC.md` and `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` exist and preserve lens-not-authority language;
> - `Dependencies.csv` validates against the v3.1 schema;
> - `_DEPENDENCIES.md` counts match the CSV;
> - `_STATUS.md` remains within the allowed setup lifecycle and reaches `SEMANTIC_READY` only after semantic and dependency artifacts exist;
> - no files outside the DEL-06-03 write scope were edited.
>

### CLM-022 — Records

> ##### Records
>
> The setup records are the deliverable-local documents, dependency register, semantic artifacts, status history, and run records under `_run_records/`.

- **VER-001** — Validate the contract and review source parity, declarative input binding, completeness and provenance classes, unit compatibility, RULE_INPUTS_INCOMPLETE and RULE_CHECK_BLOCKING behavior, schema/status dependencies, protected-content escalation, and surviving governed conflicts.

>

### CLM-025 — Purpose

> ##### Purpose
>
> The required-input completeness checker protects the boundary between an open mechanics solve and a user-defined rule-pack check. A mechanics result may exist while a rule-check result is blocked because the user has not supplied required code-specific or project-specific data.
>

### CLM-026 — Principles

> ##### Principles
>
> 1. Missing rule-check data is a finding.
> 2. Code-specific defaults are not invented by the public project.
> 3. User rule packs are user-owned or private design-basis artifacts unless explicitly contributed with redistribution rights.
> 4. The checker gates software status only; it does not certify code compliance or professional acceptability.
> 5. Provenance is part of completeness whenever reliance on the supplied value may affect engineering judgment.
>

### CLM-027 — Considerations

> ##### Considerations
>
> The checker should eventually be strict about required-input declarations while staying neutral about the content of private rule packs. It can say that a required value is absent, unit-incompatible, unprovenanced, or unresolved. It must not embed standards-body tables, quote protected clauses, derive protected formulas, or silently choose engineering values.
>
> Completeness should be machine-checkable from declarative metadata. If a future rule pack needs code-specific formulas or allowables, those belong in the user's private rule pack or another lawfully redistributable source with provenance.
>

### CLM-028 — Trade-offs

> ##### Trade-offs
>
> | Trade-off | Guidance |
> |---|---|
> | Strict blocking vs. user convenience | Prefer explicit blocking for missing declared required inputs. Convenience must not create hidden defaults. |
> | Provenance warning vs. missing input | Distinguish "value absent" from "value present but source weak or unknown." |
> | Public examples vs. realistic code data | Use invented non-code examples in public artifacts. Do not approximate protected standards data. |
> | Software finding vs. professional judgment | Report a machine finding and keep professional acceptance outside the rule engine. |
>

### CLM-029 — Examples

> ##### Examples
>
> This setup artifact intentionally includes no engineering example values. Later public tests should use invented/non-code placeholder rule packs that demonstrate missing-input behavior without resembling protected standards content.
>

### CLM-030 — Conflict Table (for human ruling)

> ##### Conflict Table (for human ruling)
>
> | Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted sections | Proposed authority (PROPOSAL) | Human ruling |
