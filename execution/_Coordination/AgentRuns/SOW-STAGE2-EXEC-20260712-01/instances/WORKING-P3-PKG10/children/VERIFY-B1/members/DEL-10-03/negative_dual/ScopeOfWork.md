### CLM-007 — Construction

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Datasheet.md","line_end":75,"line_start":61,"source_sha256":"76a8abe268651afbeb8cc35155a8a175c2a54700beb75b20f0ca7ff2d5ffad1a","target_id":"CLM-007"} -->
##### Construction

The local FEA handoff contract is a conceptual export package. It should be described in schema-ready terms without choosing a final external tool format.

| Contract surface | Minimum concept slots | Setup status |
|---|---|---|
| Handoff package identity | Package ID, source project/model IDs, originating OpenPipeStress version, package schema version, creation timestamp, privacy/export posture. | Concept defined; final schema field names TBD. |
| Selected local-detail scope | Region selection reference, included components/elements/nodes, cut boundary description, selection rationale, advisory criteria label. | Concept defined; selection UX and storage details TBD. |
| Global model context | Units, coordinate frame, model hash, relevant materials/sections/components by reference, solve status, load case/result basis, diagnostics summary. | Concept defined; exact result reference structure TBD. |
| Boundary condition transfer | Cut locations, coordinate frames, displacement/force/moment/resultant context, load-case association, sign convention notes, unit metadata. | Concept defined; no external solver mapping chosen. |
| Local geometry/idealization notes | User-supplied local-detail assumptions, meshing/idealization notes, omitted features, open questions, source/provenance records. | Guidance only; no shell/solid mesh implementation. |
| Handoff guidance label | Advisory labels such as `GLOBAL_CENTERLINE_EXPECTED_SUFFICIENT`, `LOCAL_DETAIL_REVIEW_RECOMMENDED`, `LOCAL_FEA_HANDOFF_RECOMMENDED`, and `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED`. | Proposed vocabulary for future review, not certification. |
| Diagnostics and limitations | Diagnostic code/class/severity/source/affected object/message/remediation/provenance, warnings, assumptions, limitations, unresolved `TBD`s. | Governed by AB-00-06. |
| Reproducibility manifest | Canonical JSON payload hash where applicable, model/result hashes, source pointers, rule-pack references without exposing private values. | Concept defined; canonicalization edge cases TBD. |

##### Standards

No protected engineering code, standards clauses, tables, formulas, examples, material allowables, SIF/flexibility content, protected dimensional data, proprietary external-tool behavior, or proprietary vendor data are incorporated into this deliverable.

Applicable internal baselines:

- `docs/CONTRACT.md` invariant catalog, especially OPS-K-IP-1/2/3, OPS-K-DATA-1/2/3, OPS-K-UNIT-1, OPS-K-PRIV, OPS-K-AUTH-1, OPS-K-AGENT-1..4, and OPS-K-MECH-1/2.
- `docs/DIRECTIVE.md` for centerline global model first, local FEA as specialized handoff, stop rules, and professional-responsibility boundaries.
- `docs/TYPES.md` for API contract type, analysis-status vocabulary, epistemic labels, provenance labels, centerline model, and local FEA handoff vocabulary.
- `docs/SPEC.md` for layer responsibilities, domain objects, solver/result/report boundaries, diagnostics classes, verification strategy, and Type 2 acceptance semantics.
- `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md` for public/private data, provenance, quarantine, private user data, and report boundary policy.
- `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` revision 0.7 for SOW-031, SOW-049, OBJ-009, PKG-10, AB-00-02/03/04/06/07/08, and OI-004.

External implementation baseline:

- JSON Schema 2020-12 is the accepted public schema/interchange baseline by SCA-001. This setup deliverable does not create a repository-level schema file and does not choose an external FEA exchange format.

##### Verification

| Requirement IDs | Verification approach |
|---|---|
| REQ-01, REQ-06, REQ-10 | Boundary review confirms local FEA is framed as optional guidance and that human review remains required. |
| REQ-02, REQ-03, REQ-04, REQ-11 | Contract review confirms package identity, selected local region, global context, boundary-condition concepts, units, provenance, diagnostics, privacy, and reproducibility slots are represented at concept level. |
| REQ-05, REQ-09 | TBD review confirms missing values, external format/tool decisions, schema placement, and implementation details are visible rather than silently resolved. |
| REQ-07 | Protected-content review confirms no protected standards data, proprietary external-tool behavior, private project data, or private rule-pack values are introduced. |
| REQ-08 | Adapter/API review confirms no-bypass constraints are carried into the handoff boundary. |
| REQ-12 | Setup evidence review confirms four docs, semantic/lensing artifacts, dependency artifacts, run records, and status updates exist and pass local gates. |
| Future implementation gate | Later source-code or schema work must add tests for handoff export schema validation, unit/provenance/privacy checks, protected-content screening, diagnostics, reproducibility metadata, and no-certification language before release use. |

### CLM-020 — D-41 R5 T7 PDU-055 current declaration

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Procedure.md","line_end":20,"line_start":13,"source_sha256":"a16f0195f68deff5f2ffc2e088d81e7e3a23f4a9d91a401da1dda1dc416290d6","target_id":"CLM-020"} -->
##### D-41 R5 T7 PDU-055 current declaration

Current authority is `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` revision 0.8, approved `execution/_DAG/DAG-007/` graph context, and D-41/`DEC-074` through the completed T1-T6 bounded records. The implemented working-tree slice and its evidence supersede this surface's setup-only, future-only, or overtaken TBD wording as a current declaration; that earlier wording remains historical setup context only.

Surviving deliverable-local residuals and gates are those recorded in `_STATUS.md ## Remaining`; dated MEMORY and formal-review history remain unchanged. This refresh does not imply lifecycle, review, validation, release, professional-reliance, or code-compliance closure.

PDU-055 cited claim(s): `DEL-10-03-DECL-004`.

### CLM-021 — Purpose

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Procedure.md","line_end":24,"line_start":21,"source_sha256":"a16f0195f68deff5f2ffc2e088d81e7e3a23f4a9d91a401da1dda1dc416290d6","target_id":"CLM-021"} -->
##### Purpose

Use this procedure to produce, review, and later refine the DEL-10-03 local FEA handoff data contract without implementing external FEA, choosing final external formats, embedding proprietary tool behavior, bypassing adapter/API governance, or making compliance/certification claims.

<!-- sow-source-end -->

### CLM-022 — Prerequisites

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Procedure.md","line_end":32,"line_start":25,"source_sha256":"a16f0195f68deff5f2ffc2e088d81e7e3a23f4a9d91a401da1dda1dc416290d6","target_id":"CLM-022"} -->
##### Prerequisites

- The sealed DEL-10-03 context is available in `_CONTEXT.md`.
- Governing documents and registers named in `_REFERENCES.md` have been read.
- Applicable architecture basis IDs AB-00-01, AB-00-02, AB-00-03, AB-00-04, AB-00-06, AB-00-07, and AB-00-08 are treated as dispatch constraints, not copied as full PKG-00 authority.
- Current setup write scope is restricted to this deliverable folder.
- External FEA implementation, final exchange formats, concrete adapter code, shell/solid meshing, solver-specific boundary-condition mapping, and schema file placement remain TBD.

<!-- sow-source-end -->

### CLM-023 — Steps

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Procedure.md","line_end":74,"line_start":33,"source_sha256":"a16f0195f68deff5f2ffc2e088d81e7e3a23f4a9d91a401da1dda1dc416290d6","target_id":"CLM-023"} -->
##### Steps

1. Confirm identity and scope:
   - Verify the deliverable is `DEL-10-03` under `PKG-10`.
   - Confirm scope items SOW-031 and SOW-049 and objective OBJ-009.
   - Confirm no edit target is outside this deliverable folder.
2. Establish the boundary:
   - Record that global centerline/frame analysis is the normal global method.
   - Record that local shell/solid FEA is an optional specialized handoff path.
   - Record that the contract is guidance/data-contract work only.
3. Inventory handoff package concept slots:
   - Package identity and schema version.
   - Source project/model/result references and hashes.
   - Selected local region and selection rationale.
   - Unit system and coordinate frames.
   - Load-case/result basis and diagnostics.
   - Boundary-condition transfer concepts.
   - Local-detail assumptions and omitted-feature notes.
   - Provenance, redistribution status, privacy classification, and review status.
   - Limitations, advisory criteria label, and human-review notice.
4. Define advisory criteria labels:
   - Use labels to communicate screening posture.
   - Keep labels advisory and human-reviewed.
   - Do not convert labels into compliance, certification, approval, or automatic acceptability status.
5. Preserve no-bypass controls:
   - Require future handoff export behavior to pass through schema, unit, provenance, privacy, protected-content, diagnostics, hash, and report-boundary checks.
   - Do not authorize direct solver, storage, report, private-library, or external-tool bypass paths.
6. Preserve unresolved decisions:
   - Mark final schema filename/location, exchange format list, external FEA tool behavior, adapter implementation, boundary-condition mapping, and validation fixtures as `TBD`.
   - Do not choose defaults without human/project authority evidence.
7. Check protected-data and authority boundaries:
   - Confirm no protected standards text, tables, copied formulas, proprietary vendor data, private project data, private rule-pack values, or commercial software examples are embedded.
   - Confirm no wording claims certification, sealing, approval, endorsement, or code compliance.
8. Produce setup artifacts:
   - Four-document kit.
   - `_SEMANTIC.md`.
   - `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md`.
   - `Dependencies.csv`.
   - `_DEPENDENCIES.md`.
   - `_run_records/*`.
   - `_STATUS.md` with `SEMANTIC_READY` only after setup gates pass.

### CLM-024 — Verification

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Procedure.md","line_end":87,"line_start":75,"source_sha256":"a16f0195f68deff5f2ffc2e088d81e7e3a23f4a9d91a401da1dda1dc416290d6","target_id":"CLM-024"} -->
##### Verification

| Check | Expected result |
|---|---|
| Write-scope check | Only files in the DEL-10-03 folder changed. |
| Four-document check | Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, and Procedure exist with default sections. |
| Handoff boundary check | Local FEA is optional/specialized; global centerline/frame analysis remains the normal global method. |
| Implementation boundary check | No external FEA implementation, mesh generation, external solver behavior, final exchange format, source code, package manifest, or repository-level schema file is introduced. |
| Protected-data check | No protected standards content, proprietary commercial data, private project/rule/component/material data, or copied commercial software examples are introduced. |
| Professional-boundary check | No certification, sealing, approval, endorsement, or code-compliance claim appears. |
| Semantic check | `_SEMANTIC.md` and `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` exist and preserve lens-not-authority separation. |
| Dependency check | `Dependencies.csv` validates against v3.1 schema and canonical enum values. |

##### Completion Condition

The setup sequence is complete when the required setup artifacts exist, dependency validation passes, semantic/lensing artifacts are internally consistent, unresolved decisions remain visible as `TBD`, protected-data/professional-boundary checks are clean, and `_STATUS.md` records `SEMANTIC_READY` without any `ISSUED` transition.

### CLM-030 — Purpose

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":24,"line_start":21,"source_sha256":"48f8c7b79574564f0d7a2629f375ec111feb13d112d9ced6ea348bf94b4cd0b3","target_id":"CLM-030"} -->
##### Purpose

This deliverable gives future adapter, API, report, validation, and documentation work a governed data-contract boundary for local shell/solid FEA handoff. It exists to make selected local-detail handoff possible without changing the normal global analysis method, bypassing unit/provenance/privacy controls, importing protected data, or overstating what software can decide.

<!-- sow-source-end -->

### CLM-031 — Principles

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":34,"line_start":25,"source_sha256":"48f8c7b79574564f0d7a2629f375ec111feb13d112d9ced6ea348bf94b4cd0b3","target_id":"CLM-031"} -->
##### Principles

- Treat local FEA handoff as an optional interoperability path. The OpenPipeStress global model remains a 3D centerline/frame model unless later scope explicitly changes that boundary.
- Keep the handoff package descriptive and reproducible. It should identify the source model, selected local region, units, load/result basis, diagnostics, assumptions, provenance, and hashes.
- Keep criteria labels advisory. They can help a user decide where further local review may be warranted, but they cannot certify adequacy, compliance, approval, or professional acceptability.
- Prefer schema-ready concepts and `TBD` placeholders over invented external solver fields, mesh settings, or proprietary exchange behavior.
- Require every dimensional or engineering value in the handoff package to carry units and source/provenance where reliance may be affected.
- Preserve public/private and protected-content boundaries. User-private values may be referenced as private inputs; protected or proprietary data must not become public project content.
- Route future export behavior through governed adapter/API envelopes so diagnostics, privacy controls, provenance checks, and report controls remain active.

### CLM-032 — Considerations

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":58,"line_start":35,"source_sha256":"48f8c7b79574564f0d7a2629f375ec111feb13d112d9ced6ea348bf94b4cd0b3","target_id":"CLM-032"} -->
##### Considerations

The local FEA handoff boundary has several audiences:

| Audience | What it needs | Boundary implication |
|---|---|---|
| Global piping analyst | A clear advisory reason why local-detail review is being considered. | Provide guidance labels and limitations, not certification. |
| External FEA specialist | Enough context to reconstruct a local problem responsibly. | Include selected region, units, coordinate frame, load/result basis, boundary-condition concepts, diagnostics, and assumptions. |
| Adapter/API implementer | Stable schema-ready contract surfaces. | Keep final tool formats and export mechanics TBD until a later implementation brief. |
| Reviewer/auditor | Evidence that handoff did not bypass governance. | Preserve provenance, privacy classification, hashes, diagnostics, protected-content checks, and professional-boundary notices. |

Advisory label examples for future schema review:

| Label | Intended meaning | Boundary note |
|---|---|---|
| `GLOBAL_CENTERLINE_EXPECTED_SUFFICIENT` | Current evidence suggests the centerline model is the appropriate analysis level for the stated purpose. | Guidance only; not certification. |
| `LOCAL_DETAIL_REVIEW_RECOMMENDED` | A local feature, assumption, or uncertainty should be reviewed before relying on global results alone. | Requires human interpretation. |
| `LOCAL_FEA_HANDOFF_RECOMMENDED` | A selected local-detail problem may need shell/solid treatment outside the global solver. | Does not implement or validate external FEA. |
| `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED` | Professional review is required before project reliance. | Always true for professional use. |

General factors that may support local-detail review include local geometry or restraint behavior that is not represented by the centerline model, local load introduction, attachment/nozzle/equipment interface concerns, localized discontinuity behavior, or unresolved assumptions. These are screening prompts, not automatic rules.

General factors that may support staying with global centerline analysis include a question limited to system flexibility, displacements, reactions, member forces/moments, and open-mechanics stress recovery within the model scope, with complete solve-required data, unit consistency, and visible assumptions. This is still subject to competent review.

### CLM-033 — Trade-offs

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":68,"line_start":59,"source_sha256":"48f8c7b79574564f0d7a2629f375ec111feb13d112d9ced6ea348bf94b4cd0b3","target_id":"CLM-033"} -->
##### Trade-offs

| Trade-off | Guidance |
|---|---|
| More local-detail information vs. private-data exposure | Export only what is needed for the selected handoff and preserve privacy/provenance classifications. |
| Early format selection vs. interoperability flexibility | Keep final external formats TBD until adapter work can evaluate unit, provenance, privacy, and protected-content gates. |
| Advisory criteria vs. false certainty | Use labels and rationale, not pass/fail certification. |
| Boundary condition detail vs. solver-specific behavior | Describe source model results, cut context, units, and sign conventions without choosing external solver mapping. |
| Public examples vs. protected data risk | Use invented examples only in future documentation and validation. |

<!-- sow-source-end -->

### CLM-034 — Examples

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":78,"line_start":69,"source_sha256":"48f8c7b79574564f0d7a2629f375ec111feb13d112d9ced6ea348bf94b4cd0b3","target_id":"CLM-034"} -->
##### Examples

No engineering numeric example, protected standards example, proprietary vendor example, copied commercial-software example, or tool-specific instruction is included here.

Acceptable invented examples for later work:

- A handoff package manifest that references a source model hash, selected region ID, unit system, local coordinate frame, load-case/result basis, diagnostics summary, and privacy classification.
- A local-review note that records an advisory label, human-readable rationale, open assumptions, and required reviewer follow-up.
- A result-envelope concept showing that a handoff export was blocked because units, provenance, or selected-region identity were incomplete.
