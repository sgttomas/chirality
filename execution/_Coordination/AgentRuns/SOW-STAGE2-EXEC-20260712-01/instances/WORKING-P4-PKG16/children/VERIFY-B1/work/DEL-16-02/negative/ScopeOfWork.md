# Scope of Work — DEL-16-02

## Purpose and Objective Traceability

This Scope of Work defines `DEL-16-02` in service of project scope [SOW-069] and package objectives [OBJ-015].

- **OUT-001** — A backend operation-validation and deterministic diff-preview contract that blocks invalid structured operations before application and preserves accepted model state is produced.

>

### CLM-005 — Conditions

> ##### Conditions
>
> | Condition | Data state |
> |---|---|
> | Mutation boundary | GUI and agent edits are structured model operations and must not mutate accepted engineering state directly. Source: SOW-069 in `_CONTEXT.md`; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md#Scope Ledger`. |
> | Invalid operation behavior | Invalid operations are blocked before application. Source: `_CONTEXT.md#Context Envelope`; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md#PKG-16`. |
> | Professional boundary | The package excludes hidden model mutations and autonomous engineering acceptance. Source: `_CONTEXT.md#Package Reference`; `docs/CONTRACT.md#Invariant index`. |
> | Diagnostics and result envelopes | Diagnostics/result envelopes must preserve source, severity/class, affected object, message/remediation, provenance, and no certification/compliance claims where applicable. Source: `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md#8`; `docs/SPEC.md#4.3`. |
> | Current validation flow | The current engine validates required envelope fields, runs `Draft202012Validator` against `schemas/model_operation.schema.json`, checks accepted model-state basis/hash and operation current hashes, imports blocking constraint diagnostics, then emits either generated preview rows or blocked preview rows with `application_status: not_applied`. |
> | Current diff preview shape | The current deterministic fixture-backed preview rows include `operation_id`, `change_id`, `change_kind`, `target_ref`, `preview_status`, `before`, `after`, and `application_status`. Final diff payload contract beyond this slice remains TBD pending DEL-14-03/DEL-14-05 and later application contracts. |
> | Current operation schema boundary | `schemas/model_operation.schema.json` is a JSON Schema 2020-12 contract for DEL-16-01 operation envelopes, with structured-operations-only mutation route, `direct_model_mutation_allowed: false`, downstream user-acceptance/audit bindings, operation/change taxonomies, required model basis/current hashes, unit requirements, diagnostics, provenance, and professional-boundary fields. Final upstream ownership remains DEL-16-01. |
> | Canonical dimension check | Current validation blocks quantity payload dimensions outside the accepted canonical dimension vocabulary exposed by the engine/tests and schema checks. Deeper target-field dimensional compatibility remains outside this slice. |
> | Direct mutation blocking | Current validation blocks direct accepted-model mutation signals such as applied operation validation status or forbidden auto-accepted operation statuses; output still reports `application_status: not_applied`. |
>

### CLM-006 — Construction

> ##### Construction
>
> | Construct | Expected role | Status |
> |---|---|---|
> | Operation validator | Accepts or rejects proposed structured model operations using required envelope checks, JSON Schema 2020-12 validation, model-basis/current-hash checks, canonical dimension checks, target-reference checks, direct-mutation blocking, and injected blocking constraint diagnostics before any application. | Implemented in `core/model_operations/validation_preview/engine.py`; final constraint-engine API integration remains TBD. |
> | Diff preview service | Produces deterministic before/after preview rows for supported change kinds and blocked preview rows when operation-local validation blocks preview. | Implemented in current engine and fixture tests; final diff payload contract beyond current deterministic evidence remains TBD. |
> | Validation tests | Exercise stable preview/no mutation, missing unit metadata, unknown dimensions, unresolved targets, blocking constraint diagnostics, direct mutation rejection, JSON Schema failure, model-role/current-hash checks, and prohibited-claim boundary. | Focused tests exist in `tests/test_operation_validation_preview.py`; schema contract checks exist in `tests/test_model_operation_schema.py`. |
> | Result/diagnostic envelope integration | Reports validation statuses, sorted diagnostics, accepted model-state reference/hash, `accepted_model_state_unchanged`, `professional_boundary`, and provenance without approval or compliance claims. | Implemented for this slice; final cross-package diagnostic/result-envelope schema mapping remains TBD. |

### CLM-010 — Requirements

> ##### Requirements
>
> | ID | Requirement | Source | Verification |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | REQ-16-02-001 | Proposed GUI and agent edits must enter this slice as structured model operations, not as direct hidden mutations of accepted model state. | SOW-069 in `_CONTEXT.md`; `docs/_Registers/ScopeLedger.csv`; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md#PKG-16`; `schemas/model_operation.schema.json` | `tests/test_model_operation_schema.py` checks structured-operations-only and direct mutation forbidden schema constants; `tests/test_operation_validation_preview.py::test_direct_mutation_request_is_rejected` checks current engine blocking behavior. |
> | REQ-16-02-002 | The slice must perform JSON Schema 2020-12 validation against the DEL-16-01 operation schema before treating an operation as schema-passed. | SOW-069; `_CONTEXT.md#Description`; `schemas/model_operation.schema.json`; `core/model_operations/validation_preview/engine.py` | Current engine uses `Draft202012Validator` on `schemas/model_operation.schema.json`; focused tests include valid fixture validation and `test_schema_invalid_envelope_cannot_report_schema_passed`. |
> | REQ-16-02-003 | The slice must preserve blocking constraint-validation findings before controlled application. | SOW-069; `Dependencies.csv` row `DAG-002-E0828`; `core/model_operations/validation_preview/engine.py` | Current engine accepts injected `constraint_diagnostics` and maps blocking findings to `OP-CONSTRAINT-BLOCKING` with `constraint_validation: blocked`; final constraint-engine API remains TBD pending DEL-13-03. |
> | REQ-16-02-004 | The slice must create deterministic diff previews before controlled application for supported operation/change inputs. | SOW-069; `_CONTEXT.md#Description`; `Dependencies.csv` rows `DAG-002-E0829`, `DAG-002-E0830`; `core/model_operations/validation_preview/engine.py` | `test_valid_operation_generates_stable_preview_without_mutating_state` compares canonical JSON for repeated preview output and checks before/after fixture values; final diff payload contract beyond current fixture-backed rows remains TBD. |
> | REQ-16-02-005 | Invalid operations must be blocked before application and accepted model state must remain unchanged. | `_CONTEXT.md#Context Envelope`; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md#PKG-16`; `core/model_operations/validation_preview/engine.py` | Current output reports `application_status: not_applied`, `accepted_model_state_unchanged`, blocked preview status for validation failures, and no mutation of the accepted input state. Controlled persistence/application API remains outside this slice. |
> | REQ-16-02-006 | Validation and preview outcomes must use structured diagnostics/result-envelope conventions and must not claim certification, sealing, approval, authentication, professional approval, or code compliance. | `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md#8`; `docs/SPEC.md#4.3`; `docs/CONTRACT.md#Invariant index`; `schemas/model_operation.schema.json` | Current engine returns structured diagnostics, provenance, and professional-boundary booleans; `test_output_boundary_language_does_not_make_prohibited_claims` and schema tests check prohibited claim boundaries. Final cross-package diagnostic/result-envelope schema mapping remains TBD. |
> | REQ-16-02-007 | The implementation must preserve layer/module boundaries: GUI, application services, domain core, schemas, validation, diagnostics, persistence, and tests must not be bypassed by adapters, plugins, or agents. | `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md#8`; `docs/SPEC.md#4.4`; `core/model_operations/validation_preview/engine.py` | Current slice is a backend validation/preview module with read-only fixture tests and no GUI, persistence, approval, or application behavior; downstream application/user acceptance remains DEL-16-03. |
> | REQ-16-02-008 | The slice must be covered by validation tests aligned with the approved layered testing baseline. | `_CONTEXT.md#Anticipated Artifacts`; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md#8` | Focused tests cover schema failure, constraint failure, canonical dimension blocking, preview determinism, model-basis/current-hash checks, no-apply/no-mutation behavior, and professional-boundary cases. |

### CLM-011 — Standards

> ##### Standards
>
> | Standard or governing source | Applicability | Status |
> |---|---|---|
> | JSON Schema 2020-12 | Approved schema basis for public schemas/interchange. | Current schema file is `schemas/model_operation.schema.json`; current engine validates it with `Draft202012Validator`. |
> | JCS-compatible canonical JSON hashing | Applies where JSON payloads are hashed for reproducibility or acceptance binding. | Current schema/fixture use `accepted_model_state_hash` with `canonicalization: JCS`; current engine compares the operation model-basis hash and operation required current hashes against the accepted model-state hash. Final hash payload scope beyond current model-state basis checks remains TBD. |
> | CONTRACT invariants | Applies to no-invention, professional boundary, no hidden defaults, unit/schema checks, and agent output status. | Source-supported from `docs/CONTRACT.md#Invariant index`. |
> | DAG-002 active dependency mirror | Provides approved predecessor/evidence surface for this folder. | Source-supported from `Dependencies.csv` and `_DEPENDENCIES.md`; enum normalization is not performed in this workflow by project instruction. |
> | External engineering standards | TBD. No accessible source text in this deliverable defines code clauses or engineering values for operation validation. |
>

### CLM-012 — Verification

> ##### Verification
>
> | Verification target | Required check |
> |---|---|
> | Schema-validation path | Valid operation fixtures pass schema checks; malformed or schema-incomplete operations fail with structured diagnostics from `schemas/model_operation.schema.json`. |
> | Constraint-validation path | Injected blocking constraint findings are preserved as `OP-CONSTRAINT-BLOCKING` and `constraint_validation: blocked`. Exact DEL-13-03 API remains TBD. |
> | Diff preview determinism | Same operation and same model basis produce stable canonical JSON output; current rows expose `before`, `after`, `preview_status`, and `application_status: not_applied`. Final DEL-14 payload contract remains TBD. |
> | Model-basis/hash checks | Accepted state must expose `physical_source_of_truth` role and current state hash; operation model basis and per-operation required current hashes must match the accepted state hash. |
> | Canonical dimension checks | Quantity payloads require value, unit, and dimension metadata; dimensions outside the current canonical vocabulary block unit validation. Deeper target-field dimensional compatibility remains outside this slice. |
> | No hidden mutation | Failed validation and preview-only flows do not mutate accepted model state and do not apply operations. Persistence/application behavior outside this preview slice remains TBD. |
> | Professional boundary | Outputs are diagnostics, validation outcomes, and previews only; no automatic human approval or code-compliance status is emitted. |
> | Dependency fidelity | Approved DAG-002 mirror rows remain ACTIVE and are not retired, deleted, or reclassified by this setup workflow. |
>

### CLM-013 — Documentation

> ##### Documentation
>
> - Operation validator design notes: current implementation is `core/model_operations/validation_preview/engine.py`.
> - Diff preview service contract: current deterministic row shape is implemented in `core/model_operations/validation_preview/engine.py`; final contract remains TBD pending DEL-14-03, DEL-14-05, and downstream application/user-acceptance interfaces.
> - Validation test plan and fixtures: current focused tests are `tests/test_operation_validation_preview.py` and `tests/test_model_operation_schema.py`; current fixtures are `fixtures/model_operations/invented_operation_set_valid.json` and `fixtures/model_operations/invented_accepted_model_state.json`.
> - Diagnostic/result-envelope mapping: current slice emits structured diagnostics/provenance/professional-boundary fields; final cross-package envelope mapping remains TBD.
> - Dependency preservation note: existing `Dependencies.csv` remains the approved local DAG-002 mirror/evidence surface.

- **AC-001** — The contract preserves JSON Schema 2020-12 validation, model-basis and current-hash preconditions, canonical dimension and target-reference checks, injected blocking constraint diagnostics, direct-mutation rejection, deterministic before/after preview rows, not-applied and unchanged-state evidence, structured diagnostics/provenance, upstream and downstream ownership boundaries, invented fixture evidence, professional non-authority, and explicit TBDs for final constraint APIs, diff/tolerance payloads, persistence/application, and human dispositions.

### CLM-017 — Steps

> ##### Steps
>
> 1. Confirm the proposed edit is represented as a structured model operation.
>    - Use `schemas/model_operation.schema.json` for the current structured operation contract.
>    - Preserve DEL-16-01 as the owner of final schema semantics.
>    - Source: SOW-069; DEL-16-01 dependency; `tests/test_model_operation_schema.py`.
>
> 2. Run schema validation against the approved operation schema.
>    - The current engine uses `Draft202012Validator` against `schemas/model_operation.schema.json`.
>    - Accept schema-conformant operation envelopes for later checks.
>    - Return `OP-SCHEMA-VALIDATION-FAILED` diagnostics and `schema_validation: blocked` for schema failures.
>
> 3. Check model-basis and operation-current-hash preconditions.
>    - Require accepted model state to be bound to `physical_source_of_truth`.
>    - Require accepted model state to expose a current hash.
>    - Require operation model basis and operation `required_current_hashes` to match the accepted model-state hash.
>    - Emit blocking precondition diagnostics for missing or stale basis/hash evidence.
>
> 4. Check operation/change-level blockers.
>    - Block unsupported operation or change taxonomies.
>    - Block direct mutation requests.
>    - Block missing quantity unit metadata and dimensions outside the current canonical vocabulary.
>    - Block unresolved target references for change kinds that require existing accepted-state targets.
>
> 5. Incorporate constraint validation results.
>    - Pass current `constraint_diagnostics` into the validation-preview call when available.
>    - Blocking constraint findings are preserved as `OP-CONSTRAINT-BLOCKING` and `constraint_validation: blocked`.
>    - Exact constraint engine interface remains TBD.
>
> 6. Generate deterministic diff preview output before application.
>    - Use the current accepted model-state snapshot and operation envelope.
>    - Current preview rows include `operation_id`, `change_id`, `change_kind`, `target_ref`, `preview_status`, `before`, `after`, and `application_status`.
>    - Keep final preview payload fields and tolerance defaults TBD until upstream/downstream contracts define them.
>
> 7. Block invalid operations before application.
>    - If schema or constraint validation fails, do not hand the operation to the controlled application path.
>    - Current output always preserves `application_status: not_applied` and reports whether accepted model state was unchanged.
>    - Preserve diagnostics and preview status without professional approval or code-compliance claims.
>
> 8. Hand valid, previewed operations to the later controlled application/user-acceptance workflow.
>    - This deliverable does not implement hidden mutation or autonomous engineering acceptance.
>    - User acceptance and operation audit trail are owned by DEL-16-03.

> #### Guidance: DEL-16-02 Operation validation and diff preview
>

### CLM-021 — Purpose

> ##### Purpose
>
> This deliverable exists to make proposed model edits reviewable and blockable before they become accepted model changes. It supports OBJ-015 by turning GUI and agent changes into validated, previewed, auditable model-operation flows. Source: `_CONTEXT.md`; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md#Objectives`; `docs/_Registers/ScopeLedger.csv`.
>

### CLM-022 — Principles

> ##### Principles
>
> | Principle | Guidance |
> |---|---|
> | Treat operations as the mutation boundary | All GUI and agent edits should be represented as structured operations before application. Do not design a bypass path for direct accepted-state mutation. Source: SOW-069; `_CONTEXT.md#Package Reference`. |
> | Validate before applying | The current engine performs required-envelope checks, JSON Schema 2020-12 validation against `schemas/model_operation.schema.json`, model-basis/current-hash checks, injected blocking constraint-diagnostic handling, operation/change checks, and preview status generation before any application status can leave `not_applied`. Source: SOW-069; `_CONTEXT.md#Description`; `core/model_operations/validation_preview/engine.py`. |
> | Preview deterministically | Current preview output is stable for the same operation and accepted model basis using canonical JSON comparison in focused tests. Preview rows include before/after state snippets and remain `application_status: not_applied`. Final comparison payload and tolerance contract beyond current fixture evidence remains TBD. |
> | Preserve diagnostics | Validation failures and warnings should remain structured and provenance-aware. Source: architecture basis AB-00-06 in `_CONTEXT.md`; `docs/SPEC.md#4.3`. |
> | Preserve professional boundaries | Validation and preview results are decision-support/control-surface outputs, not professional approval or code-compliance claims. Source: `docs/CONTRACT.md#Invariant index`; `docs/SPEC.md#4.3`. |
> | Prefer explicit TBDs | Current schema path, engine path, fixture inventory, and focused test behavior are established. Final constraint-engine API, final diff payload/tolerance contract, persistence/application behavior, and human review dispositions remain `TBD` rather than inferred. Source: `docs/CONTRACT.md#Invariant index`. |
>

### CLM-023 — Considerations

> ##### Considerations
>
> - DEL-16-02 depends on DEL-16-01 for structured operation schema semantics. Current validation consumes `schemas/model_operation.schema.json` and `fixtures/model_operations/invented_operation_set_valid.json`; final ownership of operation schema semantics remains upstream DEL-16-01. Source: `Dependencies.csv` row `DAG-002-E0827`.
> - DEL-16-02 depends on DEL-13-03 for constraint validation. Current validation accepts injected blocking constraint diagnostics and maps them to structured blocking diagnostics; final constraint engine API remains TBD. Source: `Dependencies.csv` row `DAG-002-E0828`; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md#Scope Ledger`; `tests/test_operation_validation_preview.py`.
> - DEL-16-02 depends on DEL-14-03 and DEL-14-05 for state comparison and mapping/tolerance/export contract context. Preview behavior should remain deterministic and diagnostic, not automatic external validation. Source: `Dependencies.csv` rows `DAG-002-E0829` and `DAG-002-E0830`; SOW-073 notes in decomposition.
> - DEL-16-02 depends on DEL-04-06 for diagnostics/warning contract context. Validation and preview failures should preserve diagnostic classes and provenance where the relevant contract is available. Source: `Dependencies.csv` row `DAG-002-E0831`.
> - Approved architecture-basis rows from PKG-00 are dispatchable context evidence, not Type 2 implementation authority by themselves. Source: `_CONTEXT.md#Architecture Basis Injection`; `_DEPENDENCIES.md#Authority Boundary`.

> | Early blocking vs richer preview | Current engine returns blocked preview rows for operation-local blocking diagnostics and reports global `diff_preview_status: blocked_by_validation` when any blocking diagnostic exists. It does not apply operations. Final UX/application handling of partial previews remains downstream. |
> | Deterministic preview vs tolerance defaults | Current deterministic preview evidence compares canonical JSON for fixture output and does not define engineering comparison tolerances. Keep default tolerances TBD unless DEL-14-05 or a human product ruling defines them. |
> | Agent convenience vs accepted-state safety | Agents may propose operations but do not mutate accepted engineering state directly. Favor an explicit review/apply boundary over convenience shortcuts. |
> | Validation detail vs protected-data boundary | Do not encode protected standards text, proprietary values, or code-specific defaults in validation logic. Missing required values become explicit findings. |

### CLM-025 — Examples

> ##### Examples
>
> Current invented-public examples and focused evidence are:
>
> - `schemas/model_operation.schema.json` - JSON Schema 2020-12 structured model operation contract.
> - `fixtures/model_operations/invented_operation_set_valid.json` - invented operation-set fixture covering operation/change taxonomy, required current hashes, professional boundary, and model basis.
> - `fixtures/model_operations/invented_accepted_model_state.json` - invented accepted model-state fixture with `physical_source_of_truth` role and current state hash.
> - `tests/test_operation_validation_preview.py` - focused validation/preview tests for determinism, schema blocking, units/dimensions, constraints, direct mutation, model role/current hash, no mutation, and prohibited-claim boundaries.
> - `tests/test_model_operation_schema.py` - schema contract checks for required fields, taxonomies, structured-only mutation route, current hashes, canonical dimensions, and professional-boundary constants.
>
> These examples are implementation evidence for this slice, not final project data or professional validation examples.

### CLM-026 — Conflict Table (for human ruling)

> ##### Conflict Table (for human ruling)
>
> | Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A (file + section) | Source B (file + section) | Impacted sections | Proposed authority (PROPOSAL) | Human ruling |
> |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> | None | No source conflict identified in the accessible slices. Current implementation evidence resolves earlier generic implementation-path/schema-path/test-fixture TBDs, while downstream APIs, final diff contract, persistence/application behavior, and human dispositions remain TBD. | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
