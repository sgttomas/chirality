# Scope of Work — DEL-09-01

## Purpose and Objective Traceability

This Scope of Work defines `DEL-09-01` in service of project scope [SOW-026] and package objectives [OBJ-008].

- **OUT-001** — A mechanics benchmark-suite contract covering cantilevers, frames, thermal growth, imposed displacement, and stiffness transforms with original/public/permissive provenance is produced.

### CLM-004 — Attributes

> ##### Attributes
>
> | Attribute | Setup value |
> |---|---|
> | Suite purpose | Define the evidence boundary for future mechanics benchmark cases that exercise solver and stress-recovery behavior through original/public mechanics examples. |
> | Benchmark families | Cantilevers, frames, thermal growth, imposed displacement, and local-to-global stiffness transforms. |
> | Solver boundary | The suite observes solver behavior; this setup pass does not implement solver logic, benchmark source files, tests, or final comparison tolerances. |
> | Source posture | Benchmark sources must be original, public-domain, public-permissive, or otherwise documented for redistribution before entering public artifacts. |
> | Data boundary | Protected standards examples, code text, protected tables, proprietary commercial benchmarks, and vendor/private project data are excluded. |
> | Tolerance posture | Final numerical tolerances, benchmark acceptance ranges, and release thresholds remain `TBD` pending solver prototype and human authority. |
> | Result posture | Benchmark outputs should preserve units, solver version, diagnostics/result-envelope fields, assumptions, provenance, and limitations once implementation is authorized. |
>

### CLM-005 — Conditions

> ##### Conditions
>
> This setup context authorizes only document production and local setup registers. It does not authorize edits to validation benchmark source files, implementation tests, solver modules, repo-level CI, or `ISSUED` lifecycle state.
>
> The future mechanics benchmark suite must stay aligned with the architecture-basis constraints for module boundaries, diagnostics/result envelopes, layered validation gates, unit safety, and protected-content/provenance review. Exact fixture schema, runner command, solver numerical library, output comparison format, comparison tolerances, and CI/release thresholds remain `TBD`.
>

### CLM-006 — Construction

> ##### Construction
>
> | Construction item | Status |
> |---|---|
> | `validation/benchmarks/mechanics` | Anticipated future artifact; not created or edited in this setup pass. |
> | Hand-calculation notes | Anticipated future artifact; formulas and numerical cases must be original/public/permissive and source-noted. |
> | Cantilever cases | Required family; concrete geometry, loads, units, expected values, and tolerances are `TBD`. |
> | Frame cases | Required family; concrete portal/frame cases and acceptance ranges are `TBD`. |
> | Thermal growth cases | Required family; material/thermal inputs must be user/original/public-permissive and unit-aware; values are `TBD`. |
> | Imposed displacement cases | Required family; boundary-condition semantics and expected reactions/displacements are `TBD`. |
> | Stiffness transform cases | Required family; local/global transform cases and expected matrices/results are `TBD`. |
> | Provenance index | Required before public fixture publication; exact format is `TBD`. |

### CLM-012 — Scope

> ##### Scope
>
> This deliverable specifies setup evidence for a future mechanics benchmark suite covering cantilevers, frames, thermal growth, imposed displacement, and stiffness transforms.
>
> This setup pass does not implement benchmark source files, add tests, create numerical hand-calculation cases, modify solver code, edit validation directories outside this deliverable, choose final tolerances, or introduce protected/proprietary benchmark data.

### CLM-013 — Requirements

> ##### Requirements
>
> | Req ID | Requirement | Source basis | Verification hook |
> |---|---|---|---|

>

### CLM-014 — Standards

> ##### Standards
>
> No protected standard text, proprietary benchmark suite, commercial software example, or vendor dataset is available in this deliverable-local setup context. Any future mechanics case must record source, provenance, license/redistribution status, contributor certification, and review disposition before it is accepted as a public benchmark.
>
> Clause-level or code-specific validation requirements are `TBD` and must not be inferred from protected standards.
>

### CLM-015 — Verification

> ##### Verification
>
> | Verification area | Minimum setup expectation |
> |---|---|
> | Required family coverage | The future fixture inventory explicitly maps each case to one or more required benchmark families. |
> | Analytical derivation | Hand-calculation notes identify assumptions, units, equations used from public/original mechanics, and expected result fields. |
> | Numerical comparison | Tolerance policy is cited when approved; until then each tolerance field remains `TBD`. |
> | Unit safety | Inputs, expected values, and outputs are dimensionally checked under the accepted unit system. |
> | Data boundary | Fixture provenance confirms original/public/permissive status and excludes protected standards/commercial examples. |
> | Diagnostics/result envelopes | Benchmark outputs preserve warnings, diagnostics, solver version, and limitations without compliance claims. |
>

### CLM-016 — Documentation

> ##### Documentation
>
> Expected future artifacts, when implementation is authorized, are:
>
> - `validation/benchmarks/mechanics` fixture set;
> - hand-calculation notes for each benchmark family;
> - fixture provenance and redistribution-status index;
> - benchmark runner or integration notes;
> - comparison-result records suitable for regression and release-gate review.
>
> The exact module paths, fixture schema, runner command, result export format, numerical tolerances, and CI gates are `TBD` and must not be resolved by this setup pass.

> | Conflict ID | Issue | Contenders | Human ruling |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | None | No source conflict identified in setup evidence. | N/A | N/A |

### CLM-018 — D-41 R5 T2B PDU-013 Evidence Disposition (2026-07-12)

> ##### D-41 R5 T2B PDU-013 Evidence Disposition (2026-07-12)
>
> The existing mechanics benchmarks remain explicit and dimensionally checked under `PKG09-FIXTURE-UNITS-EXPLICIT-N-M-RAD-K`. That fixture-local basis does not satisfy RQ-004 or Unit safety at the accepted-project-unit-system grain while the canonical catalog and conversion constants remain unresolved. No threshold or validation outcome is selected here.

- **AC-001** — The contract preserves unit-aware inputs and outputs, solver diagnostics, result-envelope fields, assumptions, provenance, limitations, fixture-local unit evidence, and explicit TBD tolerances and project-unit-system decisions without claiming certification, code compliance, professional approval, or project reliance.

### CLM-021 — Purpose

> ##### Purpose
>
> Describe how a future TASK worker should produce or use the mechanics benchmark suite once implementation is authorized, while preserving the current setup-only boundary.
>

### CLM-022 — Prerequisites

> ##### Prerequisites
>
> - Accepted frame-stiffness and coordinate-transform interfaces from PKG-04 implementation deliverables.
> - Accepted straight-element mechanics behavior for cantilever-style cases.
> - Accepted support, restraint, and imposed-displacement semantics for boundary-condition cases.
> - Accepted load/thermal input semantics where thermal-growth benchmarks require them.
> - Accepted unit-system, diagnostics, and result-envelope contracts for benchmark inputs and outputs.
> - Original, public-domain, public-permissive, or otherwise lawfully redistributable benchmark sources with provenance.
> - Human-approved numerical tolerance and release-gate policy; current value is `TBD`.
>

### CLM-023 — Steps

> ##### Steps
>
> 1. Confirm the sealed brief authorizes benchmark implementation and lists exact write targets.
> 2. Read the accepted solver interfaces, unit-system contract, diagnostics/result-envelope contract, and applicable validation strategy.
> 3. Select or create benchmark fixtures only from original, public-domain, public-permissive, or otherwise documented lawful sources.
> 4. For each fixture, record benchmark family, source/provenance, redistribution status, assumptions, units, model inputs, expected result fields, and derivation notes.
> 5. Keep protected standards examples, proprietary commercial benchmarks, vendor-private data, and copied code-derived formulas out of public fixtures.
> 6. Run benchmark cases through the authorized solver or headless runner without changing solver logic.
> 7. Compare outputs using the approved comparison/tolerance policy; if no approved policy exists, record `TBD` rather than inventing pass/fail criteria.
> 8. Capture solver version, result-envelope fields, warnings, diagnostics, assumptions, limitations, and comparison records.
> 9. Stop and escalate if fixture provenance is missing, protected content is suspected, numerical tolerances are unsupported, or output wording implies certification, code compliance, or professional approval.
>

### CLM-024 — Verification

> ##### Verification
>
> | Check | Expected evidence |
> |---|---|
> | Scope boundary | Benchmark work stays in authorized validation/test locations and does not modify solver logic unless separately authorized. |
> | Family coverage | Fixture inventory covers cantilevers, frames, thermal growth, imposed displacement, and stiffness transforms or records an explicit `TBD`. |
> | Fixture provenance | Every public fixture records source, license/redistribution status, and review disposition. |
> | Unit safety | Inputs, expected values, and solver outputs pass accepted dimensional checks. |
> | Tolerance authority | Comparison tolerances cite an approved source or remain `TBD`. |
> | Diagnostics/reporting boundary | Results preserve warnings/assumptions/limitations and avoid certification or compliance claims. |
>

### CLM-025 — Records

> ##### Records
>
> - Benchmark fixture inventory and provenance index.
> - Hand-calculation or derivation notes for each case.
> - Solver version and benchmark runner settings.
> - Unit-check and result-envelope comparison records.
> - Review notes for tolerance policy, fixture approval, and human rulings.
>

### CLM-026 — D-41 R5 T2B PDU-013 Check

> ##### D-41 R5 T2B PDU-013 Check
>
> Record fixture-local unit identifiers and canonical dimensions exactly. Do not describe those checks as project-unit-system acceptance until the upstream catalog and conversions are accepted and the cases are rerun through that basis. Keep comparison tolerances and pass/fail authority unchanged.

- **VER-001** — Validate the contract and review source parity, required benchmark-family coverage, source and redistribution posture, unit and diagnostic visibility, setup versus implementation boundaries, retained tolerance and project-unit TBDs, and professional-authority limits.

>
> Current authority is `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` revision 0.8, approved `execution/_DAG/DAG-007/` graph context, and D-41/`DEC-074` through the completed T1-T6 bounded records.

>
> PDU-055 cited claim(s): `DEL-09-01-DECL-003`.
>

### CLM-029 — Purpose

> ##### Purpose
>
> This deliverable prepares the evidence boundary for a future mechanics benchmark suite. It exists to make open mechanics verification repeatable and reviewable while preserving the data boundary between public mechanics cases and protected standards or proprietary examples.
>

### CLM-030 — Principles

> ##### Principles
>
> - Treat benchmarks as verification evidence, not as solver implementation.
> - Use public/original mechanics cases with clear provenance and redistribution status.
> - Keep final comparison tolerances and release thresholds as `TBD` until approved by the proper human authority.
> - Make units, assumptions, expected result fields, diagnostics, and limitations explicit.
> - Preserve the distinction between mechanics verification, user-rule checks, and professional approval.
>

### CLM-031 — Considerations

> ##### Considerations
>
> Cantilever, frame, thermal-growth, imposed-displacement, and stiffness-transform cases exercise different solver interfaces. Future implementation should identify which solver/load/support contracts each case depends on before marking a benchmark executable.
>
> Thermal-growth and imposed-displacement cases can look similar to code or owner-standard examples if copied from protected sources. Future workers should create original cases or use permissively licensed/public-domain mechanics references, then record source and license status before publishing fixtures.
>
> Stiffness-transform cases should isolate local-to-global coordinate behavior and sign conventions. Concrete transform matrices, geometry, expected values, and numerical tolerances are not authorized by this setup pass.
>

### CLM-032 — Trade-offs

> ##### Trade-offs
>
> | Trade-off | Guidance |
> |---|---|
> | Simple hand checks vs representative piping behavior | Start with analytically transparent cases; broaden only when provenance and expected-result derivations remain reviewable. |
> | Strict tolerances vs solver maturity | Record exact and approximate expected values separately when authorized; final acceptance tolerances remain `TBD`. |
> | Public benchmark usefulness vs IP risk | Prefer original/public mechanics cases even when protected examples are familiar. |
> | Release gating vs exploratory regression | Distinguish required release benchmarks from advisory regression checks after human QA policy is approved. |
>

### CLM-033 — Examples

> ##### Examples
>
> Concrete benchmark geometries, material values, loads, boundary conditions, expected results, and comparison tolerances are `TBD`. Future examples must be original, public-domain, or permissively licensed and must include provenance.
>

### CLM-034 — Conflict Table (for human ruling)

> ##### Conflict Table (for human ruling)
>
> | Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A (file + section) | Source B (file + section) | Impacted sections | Proposed authority (PROPOSAL) | Human ruling |
> |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> | None | No source conflict identified in setup evidence. | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
>

### CLM-035 — Open Enrichment Items

> ##### Open Enrichment Items
>
> | Item | Status |
> |---|---|
> | Approved benchmark fixture list and source basis | TBD |
> | Approved numerical tolerance/comparison policy | TBD |
> | Approved fixture schema and result-envelope comparison format | TBD |
> | Release-gating vs advisory benchmark classification | TBD |
>

### CLM-036 — D-41 R5 T2B PDU-013 Boundary

> ##### D-41 R5 T2B PDU-013 Boundary
>
> Fixture-local dimensional rigor is useful evidence, but it must not be promoted into a claim about an accepted project-wide unit catalog. The remaining catalog/conversion decision is upstream and is recorded as held rather than filled with new constants.
