# Scope of Work — DEL-09-05

## Purpose and Objective Traceability

This Scope of Work defines `DEL-09-05` in service of project scope [SOW-026, SOW-027] and package objectives [OBJ-008].

- **OUT-001** — A release quality-gate checklist contract routing solver, rule-engine, GUI, report-template, and mixed changes to bounded software-quality evidence and human governance decisions is produced.

> | Package ID | PKG-09 |
> | Package | Verification, Validation, and Quality Oracles |
> | Type | CI_CD_CHANGE |

>

### CLM-004 — Attributes

> ##### Attributes
> | Gate family | Release trigger | Required evidence class | Authority boundary |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | Solver changes | Changes to stiffness, loads, numerical solve behavior, diagnostics, or stress recovery behavior | Deterministic verification/regression evidence for mechanics, stress recovery, nonlinear behavior where applicable, unit checks, and diagnostic reporting | Verifies mechanics behavior only; does not certify project-specific engineering acceptance |
> | Rule-engine changes | Changes to rule-pack schema, expression evaluation, required-input handling, sandboxing, or checksum/provenance semantics | Sandbox, unit-awareness, missing-input, deterministic evaluator, invented example, and provenance evidence | Evaluates user-defined rule packs only; does not assert code compliance |
> | GUI releases | Changes to modeling, editing, solve execution, warnings, results, or report workflow UX | Workflow checks for required warnings, blocking states, result visibility, accessibility/usability, and regression coverage | Presents decision-support state without professional approval claims |
> | Report-template releases | Changes to public report templates, examples, export manifests, notices, or reproducibility records | Reproducibility, checksum stability, warning inclusion, provenance, and protected-content lint evidence | Public templates must not embed protected standards content or certification language |
>

### CLM-005 — Conditions

> ##### Conditions
> - Scope is process and CI gate definition only. This setup does not modify CI workflows, tests, release files outside this deliverable, or repo-level artifacts.
> - Final numerical tolerances, coverage percentages, performance thresholds, CI provider details, signing process, release matrix, and maintainer quorum remain `TBD` unless later approved by the human project authority.
> - Release labels describe software maturity and validation evidence only. They must not imply code compliance, endorsement, sealing, certification, or project-specific engineering acceptance.
> - Benchmark sources and public examples must be original, public-domain, or permissively licensed with documented provenance.
> - Missing solve-required or rule-check-required data is a finding and cannot be hidden by a release gate.
>

### CLM-006 — Gate Outcome Vocabulary

> ##### Gate Outcome Vocabulary
> | Outcome | Meaning |
> |---|---|
> | PASS | Required evidence for the routed gate family is present and applicable checks pass. |
> | FAIL | Required evidence exists and shows a gate failure. |
> | BLOCKED_TBD | A required threshold, automation command, authority decision, or evidence source is unresolved. |
> | HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED | Protected-content, private-data, professional-boundary, release-label, or waiver questions need human disposition. |
>

### CLM-007 — Construction

> ##### Construction
> The checklist is organized as a gate-routing artifact:
>
> 1. classify the change as solver, rule-engine, GUI, report-template, or mixed;
> 2. collect the required evidence bundle for each applicable family;
> 3. verify protected-data, provenance, privacy, and professional-boundary checks;
> 4. record open risks, `TBD` thresholds, and unresolved human decisions;
> 5. require human maintainer acceptance for release governance without treating that acceptance as professional engineering approval.
>

>
> Out of scope:
> - implementing CI jobs, tests, solver logic, GUI workflows, rule-engine logic, or report templates;
> - moving artifacts to `ISSUED`;

### CLM-019 — Purpose

> ##### Purpose
> Define the operational procedure for applying release quality gates to solver changes, rule-engine changes, GUI releases, and report-template releases.
>

### CLM-020 — Prerequisites

> ##### Prerequisites
> - The release candidate scope is identified by changed packages, deliverables, source paths, or artifacts.
> - The relevant benchmark, regression, validation, GUI, rule-engine, report, and protected-content checks are available or explicitly marked `TBD`.
> - Benchmark sources and public examples have documented provenance and redistribution status.
> - Any suspected protected or private data is quarantined before gate evidence is assembled.
> - Thresholds not approved by human authority remain `TBD`; this procedure does not invent them.
>

### CLM-021 — Steps

> ##### Steps
> 1. Classify the release candidate.
>    - Mark all applicable families: solver, rule-engine, GUI, report-template, or mixed.
>    - If classification is uncertain, route to the broader family set and record the uncertainty.
>    - If a change is mixed, run the union of applicable gate families unless a human release-authority waiver is recorded with risk disposition.
>
> 2. Assemble the common evidence bundle.
>    - Record commit/artifact identifiers, software version, solver version if applicable, model or fixture hashes where applicable, commands run, results, warnings, open risks, and unresolved `TBD` decisions.
>    - Record provenance for benchmark sources, public examples, report templates, and rule-pack references.
>    - Record that governance acceptance is not professional engineering approval.
>
> 3. Apply solver-change gates when routed.
>    - Verify mechanics benchmarks required for the affected solver behavior.
>    - Verify stress-recovery benchmarks when stresses, resultants, or report-facing stress values are affected.
>    - Verify nonlinear support convergence/state traces when nonlinear behavior is affected.
>    - Verify unit-aware calculations, deterministic repeatability, numerical diagnostics, and warning/result-envelope behavior.
>    - Keep final tolerances and performance thresholds as `TBD` unless a human ruling exists.
>
> 4. Apply rule-engine gates when routed.
>    - Verify sandboxing and arbitrary-code exclusion.
>    - Verify unit-aware expression handling and deterministic evaluation.
>    - Verify missing required inputs produce explicit findings, not silent defaults.
>    - Verify invented public examples remain non-code and protected-content free.
>    - Verify rule-pack identity, version, checksum, source note, and public/private marking are preserved.
>
> 5. Apply GUI release gates when routed.
>    - Verify visible distinction among solve-blocking missing data, rule-check-blocking missing data, provenance warnings, assumption warnings, nonlinear warnings, and IP-boundary warnings.
>    - Verify workflows do not present mechanics solved, user-rule checked, and professional approval as the same state.
>    - Verify expected model editing, solve execution, result viewing, warning, and report-preview/export workflows for the release scope.
>    - Verify accessibility/usability evidence where GUI surfaces are affected, with detailed thresholds remaining `TBD` unless approved elsewhere.
>
> 6. Apply report-template gates when routed.
>    - Verify report reproducibility and checksum/hash stability.
>    - Verify warning, assumption, limitation, provenance, rule-pack reference, and professional-boundary notices are present.
>    - Run or require protected-content lint for public templates/examples.
>    - Record the protected-content lint command/tool as `TBD` until DEL-10-04 or a human release-governance ruling supplies the automation detail.
>    - Confirm public templates do not embed protected standards text, copied tables, protected formulas, proprietary data, or certification/compliance claims.
>
> 7. Review open risks and unresolved decisions.
>    - List all open risks, `TBD` thresholds, missing evidence, failing checks, and protected-data concerns.
>    - A release may not proceed when required evidence is missing unless the human release authority explicitly accepts that risk for the relevant maturity label.
>
> 8. Record the gate outcome.
>    - Use `PASS` only when required evidence is present and all applicable gates pass.
>    - Use `FAIL` when evidence exists and shows a gate failure.
>    - Use `BLOCKED_TBD` when a necessary threshold, authority decision, or required check is unresolved.
>    - Use `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED` when professional-boundary, protected-content, private-data, or release-label questions require human disposition.
>

### CLM-022 — Verification

> ##### Verification
> - Confirm the final checklist covers solver, rule-engine, GUI, and report-template gate families.
> - Confirm the procedure does not modify CI workflows, tests, release files outside this deliverable, or repo-level artifacts.
> - Confirm no final thresholds are asserted without human authority.
> - Confirm no protected standards text, protected examples, copied formulas, allowables, SIF/flexibility tables, proprietary values, or private user data are introduced.
> - Confirm no software or agent output claims certification, sealing, endorsement, official compliance, or professional approval.
> - Confirm setup artifacts include semantic matrices, semantic lensing, dependency artifacts, run records, and `SEMANTIC_READY` status only after validation passes.
>

### CLM-023 — Records

> ##### Records
> Preserve these records in the release gate evidence bundle or deliverable-local setup record as applicable:
> - release-gate checklist result;
> - commands and outputs for relevant deterministic checks;
> - benchmark/regression fixture provenance;
> - protected-content/provenance review notes;
> - open risk and `TBD` decision log;
> - human maintainer governance acceptance record, including validation status, known limitations, open risks, unresolved `TBD` decisions, and professional-boundary notice;
> - statement that professional reliance requires competent human review.

- **VER-001** — Validate the contract and review source parity, every gate family and mixed routing, required mechanics/rule/GUI/report evidence, provenance and protected-content checks, unresolved thresholds and authority decisions, outcome semantics, and prohibited compliance or professional-approval claims.

### CLM-026 — Purpose

> ##### Purpose
> This deliverable gives future release work a bounded checklist for release quality gates. It should make gate routing, required evidence, data-boundary checks, and human governance decisions visible before solver, rule-engine, GUI, or report-template changes are promoted.
>

### CLM-027 — Principles

> ##### Principles
> - Treat release gates as software-quality and governance controls, not professional engineering approval.
> - Use deterministic evidence where available: tests, validation scripts, benchmark comparisons, report reproducibility checks, protected-content lint, and review records.
> - Keep mechanics verification separate from validation of the workflow and separate again from user-rule checks or professional reliance.
> - Require provenance for benchmark sources, public examples, rule-pack references, and report-facing data.
> - Mark unresolved thresholds and release-authority choices as `TBD` until a human ruling exists.
> - Block or escalate suspected protected content instead of paraphrasing, normalizing, or incorporating it.
>

### CLM-028 — Considerations

> ##### Considerations
> The gate families overlap. A report-template release that changes warning presentation may also need GUI or status-semantics evidence. A solver change that affects result envelopes may need report reproducibility evidence. Mixed changes should run the union of applicable gate families, with duplicated evidence referenced once in the release bundle.
>
> The checklist should be CI-friendly, but this setup deliverable does not create or alter CI workflows. Future CI implementation should consume this checklist as requirements input and keep final threshold choices visible for human approval.
>

### CLM-029 — Release Label Rationale

> ##### Release Label Rationale
> Release labels communicate software maturity and validation evidence. They are not professional engineering approval of any piping calculation, model, rule-pack result, or report. The minimum engineering-beta conditions in `docs/VALIDATION_STRATEGY.md#4` should therefore be read as release-governance criteria: required benchmarks and checks pass, protected-content lint passes where applicable, and open risks are listed and accepted by human maintainers.
>

### CLM-030 — Trade-offs

> ##### Trade-offs
> | Choice | Benefit | Risk | Guidance |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | Conservative gate routing | Reduces under-tested release paths | May run more checks than a narrow change strictly needs | Prefer conservative routing until package-specific ownership and CI thresholds are approved |
> | Thresholds marked `TBD` | Preserves human authority and avoids invented targets | Leaves later implementation work with open decisions | Record the missing decision in the release bundle and route to human maintainers |
> | Protected-content lint plus human review | Gives fast feedback while preserving legal/professional judgment | Lint cannot prove legal safety | Treat lint as evidence only, not a legal conclusion |
> | Human maintainer acceptance | Records project governance approval | Could be mistaken for engineering approval | Use explicit wording that governance acceptance is not professional acceptance of a piping calculation |
>

### CLM-031 — Examples

> ##### Examples
> | Change example | Gate routing | Notes |
> |---|---|---|
> | Solver stiffness transform update | Solver gate; report gate if output manifests change | Requires deterministic benchmark/regression evidence and visible numerical-quality diagnostics |
> | Rule-pack evaluator parser change | Rule-engine gate; security/privacy gate if sandbox surface changes | Requires sandbox, unit, missing-input, and invented-example evidence |
> | Results viewer release | GUI gate; report gate if export/preview changes | Requires warning/status visibility and regression evidence |
> | Public report template wording change | Report-template gate | Requires protected-content lint, reproducibility evidence, and professional-boundary notice check |
>

### CLM-032 — Human-Ruling Queue

> ##### Human-Ruling Queue
> - TBD: final numerical tolerance policy for solver and stress recovery benchmarks.
> - TBD: performance thresholds and permitted variance policy for release gates.
> - TBD: coverage thresholds for Cargo, Vitest, Playwright, validation, and protected-content gates.
> - TBD: CI provider, release matrix, signing/release attestation process, and maintainer quorum.
> - TBD: engineering-beta label policy beyond the minimum conditions in `docs/VALIDATION_STRATEGY.md#4`.
> - TBD: exact CI command names, automation owners, gate owners, and waiver approver roles.
>

### CLM-033 — Conflict Table (for human ruling)

> ##### Conflict Table (for human ruling)
> No source conflicts were identified during setup. Open decisions are recorded as `TBD` items rather than conflicts.
>

### CLM-034 — Boundaries

> ##### Boundaries
> This checklist is a draft setup artifact. It does not:
> - certify a calculation or model;
> - declare code compliance;
> - replace competent professional review;
> - grant redistribution rights for standards, vendor, owner, or user-private data;
> - authorize CI workflow edits or release publication.
