# Scope of Work — DEL-17-04

## Purpose and Objective Traceability

This migration candidate defines `DEL-17-04` in service of project scope [SOW-030, SOW-074, SOW-075] and package objectives [OBJ-009, OBJ-017, OBJ-018].

- **OUT-001** — A versioned CAEPIPE MBF export-profile and deterministic writer contract with explicit supported, omitted, approximated, delegated, sidecar-mapped, unsupported, and TBD behavior is produced.

### CLM-003 — Purpose

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Datasheet.md","line_end":18,"line_start":13,"source_sha256":"62ca5a1b91d89d379c9ce79f75f40d7622cfb3b5708c9247315781f51a439f0d","target_id":"CLM-003"} -->
##### Purpose

DEL-17-04 defines the document-level contract/design and first bounded implementation foundation for a CAEPIPE MBF export profile and deterministic writer. It is grounded in admitted public/official CAEPIPE MBF references, the DEL-17-01 source basis, and the DEL-17-02 export package/profile/loss-report contract.

The implementation foundation emits a deliberately narrow invented smoke subset, a JSON package contract, a deterministic MBF text member, sidecar stable-ID mapping, diagnostics, and loss reports. It does not implement a parser, external execution harness, public API, GUI action, release claim, CAEPIPE compatibility claim, code-compliance claim, or professional-acceptance claim.

### CLM-004 — Source and Evidence Slots

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Datasheet.md","line_end":28,"line_start":19,"source_sha256":"62ca5a1b91d89d379c9ce79f75f40d7622cfb3b5708c9247315781f51a439f0d","target_id":"CLM-004"} -->
##### Source and Evidence Slots

| Source slot | Required treatment |
|---|---|
| DEL-17-01 source basis | Carry CAEPIPE source findings, TBD register entries, and question-dossier gates into the target profile. |
| DEL-17-02 export contract | Carry export profile, stable-ID map, manifest, and loss-report vocabulary into the writer contract. |
| CAEPIPE public MBF import reference | Treat as evidence for MBF text input, keyword-ordered sections, and command-line behavior only; profile coverage remains source-gated. |
| CAEPIPE public MBF export reference | Treat as evidence that CAEPIPE exports MBF model data and version-flavoured MBF output; OpenPipeStress support claims remain `TBD`. |
| Implementation evidence | `core/handoff/caepipe_mbf/`, `schemas/caepipe_mbf_export.schema.json`, `fixtures/caepipe_mbf/invented/`, and `tests/test_caepipe_mbf_export_package.py` provide bounded foundation evidence. |

### CLM-005 — Profile Concepts

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Datasheet.md","line_end":43,"line_start":29,"source_sha256":"62ca5a1b91d89d379c9ce79f75f40d7622cfb3b5708c9247315781f51a439f0d","target_id":"CLM-005"} -->
##### Profile Concepts

| Concept | Required treatment |
|---|---|
| Target family | CAEPIPE MBF profile. |
| Target version basis | `TBD` until source-confirmed. |
| Record-family subset | `TBD` until downstream source review and/or vendor clarification closes it. |
| Profile-basis guardrail | The implementation foundation blocks blank or unsupported target-version and record-subset basis values; until source-confirmed closure exists, the profile must carry `TBD-17-01-001`, `TBD-17-01-002`, and `TBD-17-01-003`. |
| Stable ID strategy | Direct MBF carrying remains `TBD`; the implementation foundation uses manifest-referenced sidecar mapping as the conservative default. |
| Source basis trace | Each CAEPIPE-specific requirement must map to DEL-17-01, DEL-17-02, a public MBF source, or an explicit `TBD`. |
| Source basis guardrail | The implementation foundation blocks caller-supplied profile source-basis refs that omit DEL-17-01, DEL-17-02, `CAEPIPE-IMPORT-MBF`, or `CAEPIPE-EXPORT-MBF`, and blocks `DEL-17-03` as CAEPIPE target/source authority. |
| Loss reporting | Required for exported, omitted, approximated, delegated, unsupported, and TBD behavior. |
| Unsupported-entity severity | Missing or malformed unsupported-entity evidence blocks the package; explicit unsupported behavior is warning-level by default unless separately marked blocking; `info` severity is not accepted for unsupported behavior. |
| Pass-through options | May be target configuration only; not local code-checking logic. |

### CLM-006 — Boundary Summary

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Datasheet.md","line_end":51,"line_start":44,"source_sha256":"62ca5a1b91d89d379c9ce79f75f40d7622cfb3b5708c9247315781f51a439f0d","target_id":"CLM-006"} -->
##### Boundary Summary

- No CAEPIPE executable, commercial example, proprietary model, or copied vendor fixture is added.
- No reverse-engineered behavior or license-bypass workflow is introduced.
- No protected standards values, material allowables, SIF/flexibility values, or owner criteria are introduced.
- MBF export work remains a source-bounded foundation until a later tranche closes target version/profile and record-family coverage.
- Guardrail diagnostics preserve source uncertainty; they do not close CAEPIPE version/profile, record-family coverage, direct stable-ID carrying, compatibility, or professional reliance.
- DEL-17-03 may remain historical implementation-pattern evidence, but it is not CAEPIPE MBF source-basis authority.

| Source trace | CAEPIPE-specific statements cite DEL-17-01 source IDs or remain `TBD`. |
| Boundary trace | No proprietary examples or protected data are introduced. |
| Loss trace | Unsupported and TBD behavior is visible in the loss-report contract. |
| Profile-basis trace | Target-version, record-subset, and direct stable-ID uncertainty remain visible through carried TBD refs until source-confirmed closure exists. |
| Source-basis guardrail trace | Profile and manifest source-basis refs carry the required authority set and do not promote implementation-pattern evidence to CAEPIPE source authority. |
| Dependency trace | `Dependencies.csv` validates as v3.1. |

##### Acceptance Criteria

| Criterion | Acceptance treatment |
|---|---|
| Source basis mapping | Each CAEPIPE-specific requirement is traced to DEL-17-01, DEL-17-02, an admitted public MBF reference, or an explicit `TBD` closure path. |
| Target version closure | REQ-001 remains unresolved until the first CAEPIPE version/profile is source-confirmed or human-approved as a bounded profile decision. |
| Record subset closure | REQ-002 remains unresolved until MBF record families and required fields are enumerated from admitted evidence. |
| Stable ID preservation | REQ-005 is accepted only when direct MBF carrying is source-confirmed or the writer uses manifest-referenced sidecar mapping. |
| Loss category coverage | REQ-004 is accepted only when exported, omitted, approximated, delegated, unsupported, and `TBD` behavior are all visible in the loss report. |
| Diagnostic classification | `TBD-17-04-004` is addressed for this foundation: malformed unsupported refs, missing unsupported loss coverage, and `info`-severity unsupported losses block; explicit `warning` or `blocking` unsupported losses are accepted as classification evidence. |
| Profile-basis guardrail | REQ-010 is accepted when diagnostics block blank or unsupported `target_version_basis`, `record_subset_basis`, or carried-TBD evidence while the foundation remains source-bounded. |
| Source-basis guardrail | REQ-011 is accepted when diagnostics and schema validation block weakened CAEPIPE source-basis refs while preserving DEL-17-03 only as historical implementation-pattern evidence. |
| Fixture provenance | REQ-007 is accepted only with invented fixtures and no vendor, proprietary, protected, or owner/project examples. |
| Foundation implementation | REQ-008 and REQ-009 are accepted when schema, builder, fixture, and tests demonstrate sidecar-first IDs, deterministic MBF text, and blocking diagnostics for incomplete packages. |

##### Downstream Use

DEL-17-05 may consume this deliverable later for CAEPIPE external run harness and CSV parser work. DEL-17-05 remains blocked until DEL-17-04 has committed evidence.
<!-- sow-source-end -->

- **AC-001** — The contract preserves DEL-17-01 source authority and DEL-17-02 common package/profile/ID-map/loss contracts, a selected-profile gate, deterministic text generation, stable canonical-ID mapping, units and coordinates, pass-through target options without local code logic, invented/rights-cleared fixtures, diagnostics, loss reporting, and unresolved MBF record, field, version, line-ending, encoding, and external-validation questions without claiming broad compatibility or acceptance.

### CLM-015 — Foundation Implementation Procedure

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Procedure.md","line_end":27,"line_start":14,"source_sha256":"95a28c611da5c39a813b39cb7d7406a2fa52c29e87aeb6d6b941100de674f1f9","target_id":"CLM-015"} -->
##### Foundation Implementation Procedure

Bounded foundation implementation work must:

1. Close or explicitly carry target version and MBF record-family TBDs.
2. Define the deterministic writer subset from admitted evidence.
3. Emit a loss report for exported, unsupported, omitted, approximated, delegated, and TBD behavior.
4. Preserve stable IDs through manifest-referenced sidecars unless direct MBF carrying is source-confirmed.
5. Block blank or unsupported profile-basis values until target version, record subset, and direct stable-ID carrying are closed by admitted source evidence.
6. Block missing or unsafe profile source-basis refs so DEL-17-01, DEL-17-02, `CAEPIPE-IMPORT-MBF`, and `CAEPIPE-EXPORT-MBF` remain visible, and DEL-17-03 is not treated as CAEPIPE target/source authority.
7. Use invented fixtures only.
8. Avoid CAEPIPE compatibility, release, code-compliance, and professional-acceptance claims.
9. Keep external execution, CSV parsing, target result interpretation, public API, and GUI integration out of scope unless separately authorized.

##### Implementation Readiness Checks

Before a later writer tranche begins, re-read DEL-17-01, DEL-17-02, the admitted public MBF references, and this four-document kit. The tranche must record:

1. Target version/profile closure or explicit carried `TBD`.
2. MBF record-family and required-field subset closure or explicit carried `TBD`.
3. Stable-ID direct-carry evidence or manifest-referenced sidecar policy.
4. Loss-report coverage for exported, omitted, approximated, delegated, unsupported, and `TBD` behavior.
5. Blocking versus non-blocking diagnostic classification: unsupported behavior defaults to warning-level evidence unless explicitly blocking, while missing coverage, malformed refs, or `info` severity block.
6. Profile-basis diagnostics proving target-version, record-subset, and carried-TBD evidence cannot be silently omitted or weakened.
7. Source-basis diagnostics proving required CAEPIPE source authority cannot be silently omitted or replaced by implementation-pattern evidence.
8. Invented-fixture provenance.
9. Validation results for the deliverable-local document kit, semantic artifacts, dependency schema, and diff hygiene.

- **VER-001** — Validate the contract and review source parity, source/profile gates, deterministic writer and byte-output requirements, complete behavior classification and loss reporting, stable-ID carrier/sidecar treatment, unit/coordinate and encoding boundaries, fixture provenance, every retained MBF TBD, and absence of bundled/proprietary material, local code-checking logic, compatibility overclaim, or professional authority.

## Governing Values and Decisions — Axiology

### CLM-018 — Guidance: DEL-17-04 CAEPIPE MBF export profile and deterministic writer

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":2,"line_start":1,"source_sha256":"e4284fcebf682befd5b02bff7b21a77940b6bbe9373ff778ee16e58eae1090db","target_id":"CLM-018"} -->
#### Guidance: DEL-17-04 CAEPIPE MBF export profile and deterministic writer

<!-- sow-source-end -->

### CLM-019 — Design Guidance

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":12,"line_start":3,"source_sha256":"e4284fcebf682befd5b02bff7b21a77940b6bbe9373ff778ee16e58eae1090db","target_id":"CLM-019"} -->
##### Design Guidance

Treat CAEPIPE MBF as a narrow, source-confirmed target profile. The purpose is not to claim compatibility; it is to define and test what a bounded deterministic writer foundation may safely emit, what it must omit, and what it must report.

The safe posture is conservative: if a record family, required field, stable ID carrier, option, or target behavior is not confirmed by admitted source evidence, mark it `TBD` and require a loss-report or profile diagnostic. The first implementation foundation therefore uses sidecar stable-ID mapping and carries direct MBF ID carrying as `TBD-17-01-003`.

Profile-basis fields are guardrails, not target-support claims. Until later source-confirmed closure exists, blank values or informal target-version/record-subset labels should block the package because they would make unresolved CAEPIPE scope look settled.

Source-basis refs are also guardrails. A caller-provided CAEPIPE MBF profile should not be able to omit DEL-17-01, DEL-17-02, `CAEPIPE-IMPORT-MBF`, or `CAEPIPE-EXPORT-MBF`, and should not promote DEL-17-03 implementation-pattern evidence into CAEPIPE target/source authority.

<!-- sow-source-end -->

### CLM-020 — Interpretation Guidance

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":21,"line_start":13,"source_sha256":"e4284fcebf682befd5b02bff7b21a77940b6bbe9373ff778ee16e58eae1090db","target_id":"CLM-020"} -->
##### Interpretation Guidance

- Use DEL-17-01 for CAEPIPE source facts and unanswered questions.
- Use DEL-17-02 for manifest, profile, ID-map, and loss-report structure.
- Do not treat MBF text output as equivalent to professional acceptance.
- Do not turn pass-through target options into local code-checking logic.
- Do not infer undocumented MBF behavior from the target name or common practice.
- Treat generated MBF text as a deterministic invented smoke artifact, not as target acceptance evidence.

### CLM-021 — Classification Guidance

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":29,"line_start":22,"source_sha256":"e4284fcebf682befd5b02bff7b21a77940b6bbe9373ff778ee16e58eae1090db","target_id":"CLM-021"} -->
##### Classification Guidance

Unsupported target behavior must be classified before implementation as blocking, diagnostic-only, delegated, omitted, approximated, or `TBD`. Until that classification exists, the writer contract should preserve the uncertainty rather than enabling a broad MBF support claim.

For this foundation, explicit unsupported behavior defaults to warning-level loss-report evidence unless the loss entry marks it blocking. Missing unsupported loss coverage, malformed unsupported references, or `info` severity for unsupported behavior are blocking because they would hide material target-scope limits.

Pass-through CAEPIPE options are metadata for the target profile because they may name target-side analysis settings. They must not become OpenPipeStress local code-checking logic, local professional acceptance logic, or a substitute for user-supplied rule packs and human review.

##### Open Questions

| TBD | Question | Later closure path |
|---|---|---|
| TBD-17-04-001 | Which CAEPIPE version/profile is the first target? | Public documentation review or CAEPIPE developer/support clarification. |
| TBD-17-04-002 | Which MBF record families and required fields are in the first subset? | Source review and bounded implementation design. |
| TBD-17-04-003 | Can MBF carry stable canonical IDs directly? | Source review; otherwise sidecar-only mapping. |
| TBD-17-04-004 | Which unsupported entities block export versus produce non-blocking diagnostics? | This foundation uses warning by default with explicit blocking allowed; later source-confirmed profiles may specialize entity-specific severity. |

### CLM-023 — Foundation Guidance

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":50,"line_start":39,"source_sha256":"e4284fcebf682befd5b02bff7b21a77940b6bbe9373ff778ee16e58eae1090db","target_id":"CLM-023"} -->
##### Foundation Guidance

The first implementation foundation should remain sidecar-first and loss-report-first:

- deterministic text output is acceptable only for the invented smoke subset;
- every canonical identity must appear in a sidecar mapping or an explicit loss entry;
- every unsupported entity must be a stable reference and must have an explicit unsupported loss entry;
- target-version, record-subset, and direct stable-ID uncertainty must remain carried as `TBD-17-01-001`, `TBD-17-01-002`, and `TBD-17-01-003`;
- missing smoke-subset inputs, sidecar IDs, or loss reports should block the package;
- missing, blank, or weakened profile-basis evidence should block the package;
- missing or unsafe CAEPIPE source-basis refs should block the package;
- external execution, CSV parsing, target result interpretation, and target code/check logic remain out of scope.
