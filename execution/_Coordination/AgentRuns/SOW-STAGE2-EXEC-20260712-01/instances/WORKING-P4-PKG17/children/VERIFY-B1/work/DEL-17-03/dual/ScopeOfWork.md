# Scope of Work — DEL-17-03

## Purpose and Objective Traceability

This migration candidate defines `DEL-17-03` in service of project scope [SOW-030, SOW-074] and package objectives [OBJ-009, OBJ-017].

- **OUT-001** — A deterministic native open-JSON export-package contract that materializes the common interoperability contracts without target-specific or commercial dependencies is produced.

## Deliverable Definition — Ontology

### CLM-003 — Purpose

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Datasheet.md","line_end":18,"line_start":13,"source_sha256":"0a0dda350d199e497fa6004658e5415220c8ea44d92b423ca47678c07c2c3e04","target_id":"CLM-003"} -->
##### Purpose

DEL-17-03 defines the native open JSON export package as the project-owned debug, interchange, archival, adapter-input, manifest, ID-map, and validation-report package target.

This deliverable owns the bounded native JSON package foundation: schema contract, deterministic package builder/writer helper, invented public fixture, and focused tests. It does not implement public API, GUI action, persistence runtime, project-store export flow, downstream target adapter behavior, target compatibility, release claims, code-compliance claims, or professional-reliance claims.

##### Package Members

| Member | Role |
|---|---|
| `manifest` | Records source model identity, export profile, package member inventory, hashes, diagnostics, and boundary notes. |
| `model_payload` | Carries the project-owned JSON representation selected by a future exporter. |
| `stable_id_map` | Maps canonical OpenPipeStress IDs to package-local records. |
| `loss_report` | Records exported, omitted, approximated, delegated, unsupported, and TBD behavior. |
| `validation_report` | Records package-shape and source-boundary checks without claiming solver validation. |
| `diagnostics` | Carries warnings and blocking messages from export preparation. |

##### Implementation Artifacts

| Artifact | Role |
|---|---|
| `schemas/native_json_export.schema.json` | JSON Schema 2020-12 contract for the native JSON package foundation. |
| `core/handoff/native_json/` | Deterministic key-sorted, compact JSON builder/writer and SHA-256 helper labelled `deterministic_sorted_compact_json_payload_hash` for hashes computed here; governed source checksum metadata is passed through without relabelling, and no RFC 8785 conformance is asserted. |
| `fixtures/native_json/invented/native_json_export_package.json` | Invented public fixture for package-shape and boundary checks. |
| `tests/test_native_json_export_package.py` | Focused tests for the exact computed-hash label, governed source-checksum pass-through, deterministic bytes/digests, mutation sensitivity, timestamp-free inputs, member inventory, diagnostics, privacy/professional-boundary flags, writer output, and protected/private payload screening. |

### CLM-006 — Profile Basis

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Datasheet.md","line_end":51,"line_start":39,"source_sha256":"0a0dda350d199e497fa6004658e5415220c8ea44d92b423ca47678c07c2c3e04","target_id":"CLM-006"} -->
##### Profile Basis

The native JSON profile shall consume the DEL-17-02 export profile contract and declare:

- profile ID and profile version;
- source model identity and hash basis;
- unit and coordinate policy;
- canonical ID families included;
- package member path policy;
- deterministic timestamp policy;
- loss-report category policy;
- boundary notes for no release, compatibility, code-compliance, or professional claim.

### CLM-007 — Boundary Summary

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Datasheet.md","line_end":57,"line_start":52,"source_sha256":"0a0dda350d199e497fa6004658e5415220c8ea44d92b423ca47678c07c2c3e04","target_id":"CLM-007"} -->
##### Boundary Summary

- Native JSON is project-owned interchange and adapter input, not a public compatibility promise.
- The package may preserve source model semantics but does not certify solver correctness.
- Protected standards values, private model data, proprietary target examples, and owner criteria remain excluded.
- Any future integration or target-adapter work must keep unsupported or omitted behavior visible in the loss report.

#### Specification: DEL-17-03 Native open JSON export package

<!-- sow-source-end -->

### CLM-009 — Normative Scope

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Specification.md","line_end":10,"line_start":3,"source_sha256":"7b7b5975587d49f26b44d13ec9b494d61d3b1e4f77338d6bb24b3696b80ba774","target_id":"CLM-009"} -->
##### Normative Scope

DEL-17-03 shall define and implement the bounded native open JSON export package foundation. It shall consume DEL-17-01 source boundaries and DEL-17-02 export package/profile/stable-ID/loss-report requirements.

The bounded implementation scope includes the native JSON schema contract, deterministic package builder/writer helper, invented public fixture, and focused tests for sorted compact serialization, member hashes, manifest/member inventory, stable ID map, loss report, validation report, diagnostics, provenance, privacy, and professional-boundary flags.

This deliverable shall not implement public APIs, GUI behavior, persistence runtime or project-store export flow, downstream target adapters, CAEPIPE/PCF/glTF target behavior, release claims, compatibility claims, code-compliance claims, solver-validation claims, professional-reliance claims, or professional-acceptance claims.

### CLM-010 — Requirements

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Specification.md","line_end":23,"line_start":11,"source_sha256":"7b7b5975587d49f26b44d13ec9b494d61d3b1e4f77338d6bb24b3696b80ba774","target_id":"CLM-010"} -->
##### Requirements

| Req ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| DEL-17-03-REQ-001 | The native JSON package shall include a manifest, model payload, stable ID map, loss report, validation report, and diagnostics concept. |
| DEL-17-03-REQ-002 | The package contract shall preserve canonical OpenPipeStress identity directly in JSON records or through a package-local ID map. |
| DEL-17-03-REQ-003 | The manifest shall identify source model reference, export profile ID, package members, deterministic hash basis, and boundary notes. |
| DEL-17-03-REQ-004 | The loss report shall use the DEL-17-02 categories: exported, omitted, approximated, delegated, unsupported, and TBD. |
| DEL-17-03-REQ-005 | Validation report content shall be package-shape and source-boundary evidence only; it shall not claim solver validation or professional acceptance. |
| DEL-17-03-REQ-006 | The implementation shall emit deterministic, key-sorted, compact JSON and label SHA-256 hashes it computes `deterministic_sorted_compact_json_payload_hash`, without hiding runtime timestamps inside hash inputs. Governed caller-supplied source checksum mappings shall preserve their declared canonicalization and digest metadata or be rejected as malformed; the project-local computed-hash label does not assert RFC 8785 conformance. |
| DEL-17-03-REQ-007 | The implementation shall include invented public fixture and focused tests for package shape, deterministic hashes, diagnostics, privacy/professional-boundary flags, and protected/private payload screening. |
| DEL-17-03-REQ-008 | Target-specific or adapter-specific behavior shall remain outside the native JSON package foundation unless separately scoped. |

##### Verification Requirements

| Check | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Four-document check | The four-document kit exists. |
| Dependency schema | `Dependencies.csv` validates as v3.1. |
| Semantic artifacts | `_SEMANTIC.md` and `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` exist and are lens artifacts only. |
| Schema and fixture checks | Native JSON schema and invented fixture parse as JSON. |
| Builder and test checks | Native JSON builder compiles and focused tests pass. |
| Hash-basis checks | Focused tests verify the exact label on DEL-17-03-computed hashes, lossless pass-through of a differently labelled governed source checksum, repeatable bytes/digests, digest mutation sensitivity, timestamp-free hash inputs, and absence of an RFC 8785 conformance claim. |
| Boundary review | No protected/proprietary data or external compatibility claim is added. |

### CLM-012 — Acceptance Criteria

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Specification.md","line_end":42,"line_start":36,"source_sha256":"7b7b5975587d49f26b44d13ec9b494d61d3b1e4f77338d6bb24b3696b80ba774","target_id":"CLM-012"} -->
##### Acceptance Criteria

| Criterion | Acceptance Evidence | Source reread evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Required package members are identified and represented in the native JSON foundation. | Manifest, model payload, stable ID map, loss report, validation report, and diagnostics are listed as package members and covered by schema/builder/fixture/test evidence. | Reread Specification.md Requirements, Datasheet.md Package Members, and TP-EXPORT-006 run evidence for A-001. |
| Boundary review names excluded claim classes. | Review evidence confirms no release, external compatibility, code-compliance, solver-validation, professional-reliance, or professional-acceptance claim is introduced. | Reread Specification.md Verification Requirements and Procedure.md Bounded Implementation Procedure for X-001. |

<!-- sow-source-end -->

### CLM-013 — Downstream Use

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Specification.md","line_end":45,"line_start":43,"source_sha256":"7b7b5975587d49f26b44d13ec9b494d61d3b1e4f77338d6bb24b3696b80ba774","target_id":"CLM-013"} -->
##### Downstream Use

The native JSON package foundation supports later adapter SDK and target exporter work as a project-owned intermediate package. Later work must still define API/CLI/GUI integration, production project-store export binding, downstream target adapter consumption, and any target-specific behavior in separately scoped tranches.
<!-- sow-source-end -->

- **AC-001** — The contract preserves package, manifest, target-profile, stable-ID-map and loss-report members; canonical JSON/JCS-compatible hashing and deterministic ordering; model, unit, provenance and diagnostic metadata; complete explicit loss classification; schema validation; invented or rights-cleared fixtures; and downstream adapter boundaries without adding solver execution, target equivalence, lifecycle acceptance, or professional authority.

## Production and Verification Method — Praxeology

### CLM-014 — Procedure: DEL-17-03 Native open JSON export package

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Procedure.md","line_end":2,"line_start":1,"source_sha256":"5068a0edeea677aa3d9c1a52dd149a1989d87a1fb55b76107b70988c94fbd850","target_id":"CLM-014"} -->

##### Bounded Implementation Procedure

Bounded native JSON foundation work must:

1. Define concrete package schema and builder/writer artifacts inside the DEL-17-03 scope.
2. Preserve manifest, stable ID map, loss report, validation report, and diagnostics behavior.
3. Use invented public fixtures only.
4. Test the exact `deterministic_sorted_compact_json_payload_hash` label on DEL-17-03-computed hashes, lossless pass-through of governed upstream source checksum metadata, repeatable key-sorted compact bytes and SHA-256 digests, mutation sensitivity, timestamp-free hash inputs, member inventory, diagnostics, privacy/professional-boundary flags, writer output, and protected/private payload screening; do not represent this project-local algorithm as RFC 8785 conformance.
5. Keep protected, proprietary, release, compatibility, target-support, code-compliance, solver-validation, professional-reliance, and professional-acceptance claims out of the package.
6. Leave public API, GUI behavior, persistence runtime, project-store export flow, and downstream target-adapter behavior to separately scoped work.

## Governing Values and Decisions — Axiology

### CLM-019 — Guidance: DEL-17-03 Native open JSON export package

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":2,"line_start":1,"source_sha256":"ee55bd2cdb3a3ef2902e42f008db7a3fabeea23261c8d89609b4fac4f299ef88","target_id":"CLM-019"} -->
#### Guidance: DEL-17-03 Native open JSON export package

<!-- sow-source-end -->

### CLM-020 — Design Guidance

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":8,"line_start":3,"source_sha256":"ee55bd2cdb3a3ef2902e42f008db7a3fabeea23261c8d89609b4fac4f299ef88","target_id":"CLM-020"} -->
##### Design Guidance

Treat the native JSON package as the least target-specific export path. Its main value is traceability: it should make source identity, package contents, canonical IDs, diagnostics, and losses visible before any target adapter consumes the package.

The package foundation should be deterministic. Hashes computed by DEL-17-03 use key-sorted compact JSON (`sort_keys=True`, compact separators, ASCII escaping) labelled `deterministic_sorted_compact_json_payload_hash`; this is not an RFC 8785 conformance claim. A governed caller-supplied source checksum is upstream evidence: preserve its declared algorithm/canonicalization/digest metadata after shape validation rather than relabelling it. Runtime timestamps, if retained for reportability, should be declared rather than hidden inside hashes or manifests.

### CLM-021 — Interpretation Guidance

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":18,"line_start":9,"source_sha256":"ee55bd2cdb3a3ef2902e42f008db7a3fabeea23261c8d89609b4fac4f299ef88","target_id":"CLM-021"} -->
##### Interpretation Guidance

- Use DEL-17-02 as the contract foundation.
- Use DEL-17-01 for target-boundary discipline and source authority.
- Prefer explicit omissions over silent defaults.
- Treat validation reports as package evidence, not solver validation.
- Keep adapter-specific behavior in later deliverables.
- Treat the native JSON schema, builder, invented fixture, and focused tests as DEL-17-03-owned foundation outputs.
- Keep API/CLI/GUI integration, project-store export flow, downstream target adapters, and target-specific behavior in later deliverables or separately approved tranches.

| Item | Question | Current disposition |

| TBD-17-03-001 | Which concrete JSON schemas will bind package members? | Closed for the bounded foundation by `schemas/native_json_export.schema.json`; future schema changes require governed follow-up. |
| TBD-17-03-002 | Which hash canonicalization helper will package writer code use? | Closed for hashes computed by the bounded foundation through `core/handoff/native_json/package.py` key-sorted compact JSON and the project-local `deterministic_sorted_compact_json_payload_hash` label; governed source checksum metadata remains upstream-labelled pass-through evidence, and broader project hash unification remains an integration concern. |
| TBD-17-03-003 | Which invented fixtures will exercise native JSON round trips? | Closed for the bounded foundation by `fixtures/native_json/invented/native_json_export_package.json` and focused tests. |
| TBD-17-03-004 | Which concrete schema and writer binding source will authorize native JSON implementation? | Closed for the bounded foundation by TP-EXPORT-006 implementation evidence; API/CLI/GUI and project-store binding remain future scoped work. |
