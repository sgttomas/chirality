## Source Authority

This folder was scaffolded by ORCHESTRATOR from the accepted v3.2 SOFTWARE_DECOMP working surface. Downstream TASK work must preserve `ResponsibleParty: TBD` until a human assigns ownership.

## SCA-APP-001 Context Alignment

`SCA-APP-001` is accepted. This deliverable is aligned to the provider-adapter-general runtime strategy: Claude Agent SDK / Anthropic remains the first concrete/current path; Pi is pattern corpus/reference only; permission governance is capability-forward with explicit hard-deny precedence.

Primary impact: Future domain profile contracts must not become provider/network expansion bypasses.

Package-local review status: `SCA-APP-001-CLOSURE-002` refreshed the base context fields and reviewed or updated targeted local kit wording in `Guidance.md`, `Specification.md`, `Procedure.md`, `Datasheet.md`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, and `Dependencies.csv` against the accepted SCA. Remaining `TBD` values and non-SCA dependency lifecycle states retain their prior status.

This package-local refresh does not change runtime source, package manifests, lockfiles, desktop wrapper files, provider implementation, Pi implementation, or release-readiness posture.
