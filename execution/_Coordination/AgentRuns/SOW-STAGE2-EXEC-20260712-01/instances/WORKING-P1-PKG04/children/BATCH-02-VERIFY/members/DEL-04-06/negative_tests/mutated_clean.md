# Scope of Work — DEL-04-06

## Purpose and Objective Traceability

This Scope of Work defines `DEL-04-06` in service of project scope [SOW-053, SOW-035] and package objectives [OBJ-003, OBJ-008, OBJ-012].

- **OUT-001** — A solver-diagnostics and singularity-detection contract covering deterministic machine-readable diagnostic envelopes, mechanics-only solver status, singularity and conditioning evidence, nonconvergence, invalid model and numeric inputs, provenance, remediation, unit metadata, and reviewable result-envelope interfaces is produced for the declared scope and objectives.

### CLM-004 — Attributes

> ##### Attributes
>
> | Attribute | Current value | Source |
> |---|---|---|
> | Primary subject | `core/solver/diagnostics` implements deterministic mechanics-solver diagnostics for singular, ill-conditioned, nonconverged, invalid-restraint, invalid-topology, invalid-numeric-input, and explicit solver-configuration TBD states. | `_CONTEXT.md`; `core/solver/diagnostics/README.md`; `core/solver/diagnostics/src/lib.rs` |
> | Solver-result boundary | Diagnostics describe mechanics-solver/model-validation status under `solver_result_only` authority and do not emit rule-check status, human-acceptance status, professional approval, or code-compliance claims. | `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-MECH-2; OPS-K-AUTH-1; `core/solver/diagnostics/src/lib.rs` `SolverStatus::analysis_boundary_mapping` |
> | Diagnostic envelope fields | `SolverDiagnostic` carries `code`, `class`, `severity`, `source`, `message`, optional `affected_ref`, optional `canonical_ref`, optional `remediation`, `provenance`, and `quantity_units`. | `core/solver/diagnostics/src/lib.rs` `SolverDiagnostic` |
> | Provenance/remediation/unit metadata | Default diagnostics include solver-generated provenance with `review_status: TBD`, default remediation text by diagnostic code/severity, optional canonical model reference, and optional quantity-unit metadata. | `core/solver/diagnostics/src/lib.rs` `DiagnosticProvenance`, `default_remediation`, `with_canonical_ref`, `with_quantity_unit` |
> | Analysis-boundary statuses | `ReadyToSolve`, `ModelIncomplete`, and `SolveFailed` map to `MODEL_INCOMPLETE`; `MechanicsSolved` and `SolvedWithWarnings` map to `MECHANICS_SOLVED`; every mapping keeps `human_review_required: true`, `emits_rule_status: false`, and `emits_human_acceptance: false`. | `core/solver/diagnostics/src/lib.rs` `SolverStatus::analysis_boundary_mapping` |
> | Diagnostic classes | Blocking/failure diagnostics map to `SOLVE_BLOCKING`; ill-conditioning warnings map to `ASSUMPTION_WARNING`; warning-level solver-iteration nonconvergence maps to `NONLINEAR_WARNING`; sparse-solver and tolerance-policy deferrals map to `TBD`. | `core/solver/diagnostics/src/lib.rs` `diagnostic_class_for` |
> | Numerical thresholds | Conditioning and convergence helper functions accept caller-supplied thresholds/tolerances and reject invalid numeric inputs, but accepted release thresholds remain TBD. | `core/solver/diagnostics/src/lib.rs` `classify_condition_ratio`, `convergence_diagnostic`; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` OI-005 |
> | Sparse solver library/settings | Sparse solver selection remains TBD and is represented by an explicit warning diagnostic; no sparse numerical library/settings are selected in this deliverable. | `_CONTEXT.md` Still TBD; `core/solver/diagnostics/src/lib.rs` `sparse_solver_tbd_diagnostic` |
>

### CLM-005 — Diagnostic Category Register

> ##### Diagnostic Category Register
>
> | Category | Implemented handling | Preserved limit |
> |---|---|---|
> | Singular system | `FrameKernelError::SingularSystem` maps to `SingularSystem` / `Failure` / `MechanicsSolver` and produces a blocked `SolveFailed` report. | Sparse-solver selection and final solver integration remain outside this document update. |
> | Ill-conditioned system | `classify_condition_ratio` returns `IllConditionedSystem` warning diagnostics and `ConditioningFailure` failure diagnostics from finite, nonnegative condition-ratio evidence. | Accepted project thresholds remain TBD. |
> | Nonconverged analysis | `convergence_diagnostic` returns `NonConvergence` warning diagnostics before the iteration limit and failure diagnostics at or beyond the limit. | Nonlinear support warning finalization remains deferred pending the nonlinear support slice and accepted tolerance policy. |
> | Invalid restraint | Frame restrained/prescribed DOF errors and support findings/application errors map to blocking `InvalidRestraint` model-validation diagnostics, with `dof:*` affected references where implemented. | This does not decide rule compliance or human acceptance. |
> | Invalid model topology | Frame topology/orientation errors, support DOF alignment errors, and primitive-load topology findings map to blocking `InvalidModelTopology` diagnostics; missing load IDs use stable `load:<missing-id>` references. | Protected examples and proprietary benchmark cases remain excluded. |
> | Invalid numeric input | Frame numeric errors, linear-support errors, primitive-load errors, and primitive-load numeric findings map to blocking `InvalidNumericInput` diagnostics. | Unit conversion/default policy is not introduced here. |
> | Sparse/tolerance TBD | `SparseSolverTbd` and `TolerancePolicyTbd` diagnostics are warning-level solver-configuration diagnostics with class `TBD`. | No sparse solver, final tolerance threshold, performance claim, or release claim is selected. |
> | Solver status | `SolverDiagnosticReport` carries a solver-local status and diagnostics; analysis-boundary mapping preserves mechanics-only status semantics. | Final application-service/result-envelope integration remains deferred. |
>

### CLM-020 — Steps

> ##### Steps
>
> 1. Confirm the deliverable identity and write scope from `_CONTEXT.md`.
> 2. Read the deliverable-local truth set: `_CONTEXT.md`, `_STATUS.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, and `Procedure.md`.
> 3. Read the implementation evidence in `core/solver/diagnostics/README.md` and `core/solver/diagnostics/src/lib.rs`.
> 4. Confirm the diagnostic envelope fields: `code`, `class`, `severity`, `source`, `message`, optional `affected_ref`, optional `canonical_ref`, optional `remediation`, `provenance`, and `quantity_units`.
> 5. Confirm provenance/remediation/unit metadata surfaces through `DiagnosticProvenance`, default remediation text, `with_canonical_ref`, and `with_quantity_unit`.
> 6. Confirm analysis-boundary status mapping through `SolverStatus::analysis_boundary_mapping`; preserve `solver_result_only` authority, human review required, no rule-status emission, and no human-acceptance emission.
> 7. Confirm frame-kernel mappings for singular systems, invalid restraints, invalid topology/orientation, invalid numeric input, and matrix/vector shape failures.
> 8. Confirm linear-support and support-application mappings, including support IDs and `dof:*` affected references where implemented.
> 9. Confirm primitive-load mappings, including axial-effect finding codes and stable `load:<missing-id>` affected references for missing or blank load IDs.
> 10. Confirm conditioning and nonconvergence diagnostics with caller-supplied thresholds/tolerances and input validation.
> 11. Confirm sparse-solver and tolerance-policy TBD diagnostics remain warning-level unresolved-policy evidence.
> 12. Check recent run records for validation evidence; the June 5 Worker B record reports 19 passing diagnostics tests.
> 13. Preserve deferrals for sparse solver selection, accepted tolerance thresholds, nonlinear support warning finalization, final result-envelope integration, release claims, professional approval, and code-compliance claims.
> 14. For document-only alignment work, do not edit code, `_STATUS.md`, review finding dispositions, dependency registers, DAG files, or coordination prompts.
>

### CLM-021 — Verification And Release-Hardening Workflow

> ##### Verification And Release-Hardening Workflow
>
> 1. Use existing diagnostics unit tests as implementation evidence when the code has not changed.
> 2. Rerun `cargo test --manifest-path core/solver/diagnostics/Cargo.toml --locked` when diagnostics source or tests change.
> 3. Add original/public/permissive singular, restraint, topology, load, conditioning, and nonconvergence fixtures only within an authorized implementation scope.
> 4. Add nonlinear support active-set regression coverage only after nonlinear diagnostic policy is accepted.
> 5. Add release gate coverage for accepted sparse solver and tolerance policy only after those decisions are governed.
> 6. Verify that each fixture emits machine-readable diagnostics and does not claim professional approval or code compliance.
>

### CLM-022 — Verification

The solver-diagnostics and singularity-detection suite is live with current tests and evidence. Setup-era exact counts and checklists are historical rather than current authority; unresolved solver-policy matters remain only where explicitly recorded.

- **VER-001** — Validate the contract and review source parity, diagnostic-envelope fields and mappings, solver-status authority boundaries, singularity, restraint, topology, numeric, conditioning and nonconvergence coverage, caller-supplied policy inputs, sparse and tolerance deferrals, units and provenance, deterministic evidence, protected-content controls, and every surviving governed residual.

>

### CLM-027 — Purpose

> ##### Purpose
>
> This deliverable guides use and review of the implemented `core/solver/diagnostics` slice. The diagnostic layer makes mechanics-solver failure states explicit, reproducible, machine-readable, and reportable while preserving the project boundary between solver facts, rule checks, human review, and professional reliance.
>

### CLM-028 — Principles

> ##### Principles
>
> - Treat diagnostics as solver evidence, not engineering approval.
> - Treat `SparseSolverTbd` and `TolerancePolicyTbd` as explicit unresolved-policy diagnostics, not as acceptable release settings.
> - Preserve diagnostic provenance, remediation, affected references, canonical references, and unit metadata so downstream reports can explain which object, solver stage, and source produced a warning or blocking condition.
> - Keep invalid restraints, invalid topology, invalid numeric inputs, and missing solve-required values visible as findings; do not normalize them away.
> - Use `SolverStatus::analysis_boundary_mapping` for mechanics-only status handoff: solver diagnostics may map to `MODEL_INCOMPLETE` or `MECHANICS_SOLVED`, but they do not emit rule status or human acceptance.
> - Keep release claims, professional approval, sealing, certification, and code-compliance language outside this deliverable.
>

### CLM-029 — Considerations

> ##### Considerations
>
> - Singular models and invalid restraints overlap semantically but may require different diagnostic codes because one describes numerical rank/solvability and the other describes model-definition validity.
> - Frame-kernel mappings currently include singular systems, repeated/out-of-range restrained or prescribed DOFs, node/topology/orientation failures, non-finite/non-positive inputs, and matrix/vector shape failures.
> - Linear-support mappings currently cover support errors, support findings, and support-application errors. Support finding affected references use the public support ID; DOF application errors use `dof:*`.
> - Primitive-load mappings currently cover primitive-load errors/findings, axial-effect finding codes, and missing load IDs. Missing or blank load IDs use the stable affected reference `load:<missing-id>`.
> - Ill-conditioning is implemented as condition-ratio classification, but accepted threshold values are still a governed policy decision.
> - Nonconvergence diagnostics are implemented for iterative residual/tolerance evidence, but nonlinear support warning finalization and active-set policy remain outside the accepted slice.
> - Result-envelope integration should preserve AB-00-03 and AB-00-06 semantics so GUI, CLI, reports, and tests receive consistent status fields when the application service integrates the final envelope.
> - Thresholds remain `TBD` because the accepted authority requires reportable conditioning and convergence diagnostics but does not define release numerical policy. Later values need solver-library evidence, deterministic tests, and human-approved implementation context, and must not imply code compliance.
>

### CLM-030 — Vocabulary Notes

> ##### Vocabulary Notes
>
> | Term | Current implementation use |
> |---|---|
> | Singular | A mechanics solve state where the assembled/constrained system cannot produce a determinate solution under the chosen solver policy. |
> | Ill-conditioned | A numerical-quality warning state reported by condition-ratio classification when a caller-supplied warning threshold is met or exceeded. |
> | Conditioning failure | A blocking/failure state reported by condition-ratio classification when a caller-supplied failure threshold is met or exceeded. |
> | Nonconverged | An iterative solve state whose residual exceeds caller-supplied tolerance; it is warning-level before the iteration limit and failure-level at or beyond the limit. |
> | Invalid restraint | A model-definition finding for restraint/support data that prevents a valid solve or makes the restraint set contradictory. |
> | Invalid model topology | A model-definition finding for topology, orientation, target, connectivity, or required-reference problems that prevent valid mechanics use. |
> | Invalid numeric input | A model-validation or mechanics-solver finding for non-finite, non-positive, dimensionally invalid, or malformed numeric data. |
> | Blocking diagnostic | A diagnostic that prevents treating the mechanics solve as completed. |
> | TBD diagnostic | A warning-level diagnostic that records a deliberately unresolved solver policy or adapter selection. |

> | Diagnostic granularity | Use the implemented `SolverDiagnosticCode` registry before adding new diagnostic kinds. | Additional nonlinear-support warning classes remain deferred. |
> | Conditioning warnings | Preserve reportability and provenance while passing threshold values explicitly from accepted solver policy. | Accepted release thresholds and sparse solver settings remain TBD. |
> | Fixture design | Use original/public/invented models and avoid protected examples. | Additional release gate fixture inventory remains TBD. |
> | Status wording | State mechanics-solver facts only and preserve `solver_result_only` authority. | Human review, rule checks, and professional reliance remain outside solver authority. |
> | Result integration | Keep diagnostic records and status mapping stable for the application result envelope. | Final result-envelope integration remains deferred. |

### CLM-032 — Examples

> ##### Examples
>
> No example models are added by this document alignment. Any later examples should be invented/public/permissive and should not reproduce protected standard examples or proprietary benchmark cases.

### CLM-033 — Conflict Table (for human ruling)

> ##### Conflict Table (for human ruling)
>
> No new source conflicts were found during this document/evidence alignment. Numerical threshold policy, sparse solver selection, nonlinear support warning finalization, final result-envelope integration, release claims, and professional/code-compliance claims remain deferrals, not conflicts.
