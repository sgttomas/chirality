# Scope of Work — DEL-04-04

## Purpose and Objective Traceability

This Scope of Work defines `DEL-04-04` in service of project scope [SOW-012] and package objectives [OBJ-003].

- **OUT-001** — A nonlinear-support classifier and state-oracle contract covering one-way restraints, gaps, lift-off, friction, state-switched transitions, convergence and non-convergence reporting, report-facing records, and integration-facing deterministic verification is produced for the declared scope and objective.

>
> | Construction element | Local setup position |
> |---|---|
> | Active-set iteration loop | Re-pointed by `DEC-044`: assembled loop ownership is `core/solver/nonlinear_integration`; this deliverable supplies the per-iteration classifier/state oracle. |
> | Support activation state model | In scope for this deliverable; exact downstream integration contract is owned by the integration tranche. |
> | Gap/lift-off/one-way state transitions | In scope for this deliverable; rules must be evidence-backed and tested. |
> | Friction behavior | In scope as a named behavior category; numerical model, defaults, and limits are TBD. |

### CLM-007 — D-41 R5 T7 PDU-054 current declaration

> ##### D-41 R5 T7 PDU-054 current declaration
>
> Earlier setup-era statements on this surface are retained as historical setup context where applicable; this section is the active current-state declaration. The nonlinear support slice and DEC-067 Coulomb-friction basis (`±mu*N`) are implemented and evidenced. Broader nonlinear policies and validation thresholds survive only where explicitly recorded; this currentness declaration is not an engineering acceptance.

## Completion and Reliance Basis — Epistemology

### CLM-009 — Scope

> ##### Scope
>
> DEL-04-04 covers the per-iteration active-set classifier/state oracle for
> nonlinear support behavior: one-way supports, gaps, lift-off, friction, and
> convergence reporting. Per `DEC-044`, the assembled nonlinear loop that wraps
> frame assembly/solve around this classifier is owned by the PKG-04 integration
> tranche `core/solver/nonlinear_integration`. This deliverable does not set

> claims.

### CLM-010 — Requirements

> ##### Requirements
>
> | ID | Requirement | Source | Verification |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | DEL-04-04-REQ-01 | The deliverable shall preserve the 3D centerline/frame mechanics boundary for global piping analysis. | OPS-K-MECH-1; PKG-04 package scope | Architecture and solver-boundary tests confirm no local FEA substitution is introduced. |
> | DEL-04-04-REQ-02 | The nonlinear support classifier shall address one-way restraints, lift-off, gaps, and friction for consumption by a controlled iterative method. | SOW-012; Deliverables.csv DEL-04-04; DEC-044 | Classifier and integration tests cover invented representative cases for each behavior category. |
> | DEL-04-04-REQ-03 | The implementation shall report convergence state, active-set state, and unresolved non-convergence. | OPS-K-SOLVER-2; AB-00-06 | Result-envelope and diagnostic tests assert reported state fields and warning class behavior. |
> | DEL-04-04-REQ-04 | Solver changes shall have deterministic verification tests before release use. | OPS-K-SOLVER-1; AB-00-08 | Test inventory includes nonlinear support classifier and assembled-loop convergence/non-convergence regression cases. |
> | DEL-04-04-REQ-05 | Missing solve-required nonlinear support inputs shall be explicit findings, never silent defaults. | OPS-K-DATA-2; AB-00-06 | Negative tests assert missing data produces diagnostics rather than assumed values. |
> | DEL-04-04-REQ-06 | Unit-bearing support, displacement, force, and friction-related quantities shall be unit-aware and dimensionally checked where applicable. | OPS-K-UNIT-1 | Unit tests cover accepted, rejected, and missing unit metadata. |
> | DEL-04-04-REQ-07 | The solver shall compute mechanics only; rule-pack acceptability and professional compliance remain outside this deliverable. | OPS-K-MECH-2; package exclusions | Reports and result labels avoid compliance/certification language. |
> | DEL-04-04-REQ-08 | Result and diagnostic outputs shall support report disclosure of solver version, warnings, assumptions, limitations, and provenance notes. | OPS-K-REPORT-1; AB-00-06 | Report-facing fixture tests confirm required metadata is present or explicitly TBD. |
> | DEL-04-04-REQ-09 | Implementation choices for sparse live-path adoption, class-tiered convergence values, friction defaults, and final data contracts remain governed or TBD until later authorized work. | _CONTEXT.md Still TBD; OPS-K-AGENT-1; DEC-044; DEC-046; human hard stops | Review confirms no invented values or defaults appear in setup artifacts. |

### CLM-011 — Standards

> ##### Standards
>
> No protected standards text, formulas, tables, examples, or code-specific values are included in this setup kit. Public/protected data boundaries follow docs/CONTRACT.md. Any later code-specific or project-specific engineering values must be user-supplied or lawfully imported private data where applicable.
>

### CLM-012 — Verification

> ##### Verification
>
> Verification shall include deterministic invented-example tests for active-set
> activation/deactivation, gap closure/opening, lift-off, one-way support
> behavior, friction state reporting, convergence, and non-convergence
> diagnostics. Per `DEC-067`, unilateral-support classification is
> state-switched: engaged supports (including closed gaps) classify on trial
> reaction sign and released supports classify on trial displacement penetration
> (or the explicit gap clearance), so re-engagement and lift-off transitions are
> observable and the converged state does not depend on seeded initial states;
> verification includes transition witnesses for re-engagement of a lifted
> one-way support, lift-off of a closed gap, and bounded +/- mu*N friction
> sliding. Assembled-loop verification is owned by
> `core/solver/nonlinear_integration` under `DEC-044`; exact pass/fail
> thresholds, test matrices, and measured convergence values remain governed by
> `DEC-046` and must not be invented by this setup pass.
>

### CLM-013 — Documentation

> ##### Documentation
>
> Required documentation artifacts for this setup are `Datasheet.md`,
> `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, `Procedure.md`, `_SEMANTIC.md`,
> `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, `Dependencies.csv`, and
> `_run_records/`. The assembled-loop integration artifact is
> `core/solver/nonlinear_integration`.

- **AC-001** — The contract preserves the accepted classifier versus assembled-loop ownership, implemented state-transition and bounded Coulomb-friction basis, unit and diagnostic boundaries, explicit missing inputs, mechanics-only posture, and unresolved path-history, convergence-threshold, sparse-live-path, and validation policies without inventing defaults or engineering acceptance.

## Production and Verification Method — Praxeology

### CLM-014 — Procedure: DEL-04-04 Nonlinear support active-set solver

> #### Procedure: DEL-04-04 Nonlinear support active-set solver
>

### CLM-015 — Purpose

> ##### Purpose
>
> Define the documentation setup procedure for DEL-04-04 without implementing nonlinear solver code.
>

### CLM-016 — Prerequisites

> ##### Prerequisites
>
> - Read `_CONTEXT.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, and `_STATUS.md`.
> - Apply docs/CONTRACT.md invariants OPS-K-MECH-1, OPS-K-MECH-2, OPS-K-UNIT-1, OPS-K-SOLVER-1, OPS-K-SOLVER-2, OPS-K-DATA-2, OPS-K-REPORT-1, and OPS-K-AGENT-1 through OPS-K-AGENT-4.
> - Apply architecture basis AB-00-01, AB-00-02, AB-00-03, AB-00-06, and AB-00-08.
> - Keep all writes inside the DEL-04-04 folder.
>

### CLM-017 — Steps

> ##### Steps
>
> 1. Confirm the deliverable identity is DEL-04-04 under PKG-04.
> 2. Confirm the setup scope is documentation only: four documents, semantic files, dependency artifacts, and run records.
> 3. Capture nonlinear support behavior categories from SOW-012 and the deliverables register: one-way supports, gaps, lift-off, and friction. Per `DEC-067`, the implemented classifier decision boundary is state-switched (engaged supports classify on reaction sign, released supports on displacement penetration/clearance) and a sliding friction support carries the bounded `+/- mu*N` tangential force in the assembled loop rather than a full DOF release.
> 4. Record future implementation needs as `TBD` when exact numerical library choices, convergence thresholds, friction defaults, or data contracts are not provided.
> 5. Preserve mechanics/reporting boundaries: mechanics solved by solver, acceptability handled by rule packs or humans, and no compliance/certification claims.
> 6. Generate dependency rows only from explicit scope, architecture, invariant, or local-document evidence.
> 7. Run local schema validation for `Dependencies.csv`.
>

### CLM-018 — Verification

> ##### Verification
>
> - Four production documents exist and retain Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, and Procedure roles.
> - `_SEMANTIC.md` exists and separates semantic lensing from engineering authority.
> - `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` exists and records warranted enrichment items without rewriting production documents.
> - `Dependencies.csv` validates against v3.1 schema.
> - `_STATUS.md` is not advanced to `ISSUED`.
>

### CLM-019 — Records

> ##### Records
>
> - `Datasheet.md`
> - `Specification.md`
> - `Guidance.md`
> - `Procedure.md`
> - `_SEMANTIC.md`
> - `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md`
> - `Dependencies.csv`
> - `_DEPENDENCIES.md`
> - `_run_records/TASK_RUN_2026-04-30_1015_*.md`

- **VER-001** — Validate the contract and review source parity, nonlinear behavior categories and state transitions, classifier/integration ownership, convergence diagnostics, units and provenance, protected-content and professional boundaries, deterministic transition witnesses, and every surviving governed residual.

## Governing Values and Decisions — Axiology

### CLM-020 — Guidance: DEL-04-04 Nonlinear support active-set solver

> #### Guidance: DEL-04-04 Nonlinear support active-set solver
>

### CLM-021 — Purpose

> ##### Purpose
>
> This deliverable prepares a future nonlinear support active-set solver slice within PKG-04. Its value is to keep nonlinear mechanical behavior, diagnostics, unit handling, and result reporting bounded before implementation work begins.
>

### CLM-022 — Principles

> ##### Principles
>
> - Treat active-set matrices and support states as mechanics-solving concerns, not rule-pack compliance decisions.
> - Keep friction, gap, lift-off, and one-way support behavior explicit in state and diagnostics rather than hidden in defaults.
> - Use `TBD` for numerical tolerances, friction defaults, and exact data contracts until an authorized implementation brief supplies or derives them.
> - Preserve result-envelope discipline from AB-00-03 and diagnostic discipline from AB-00-06.
> - Use invented verification fixtures only; do not reproduce protected code examples, tables, or formulas.
>

### CLM-023 — Considerations

> ##### Considerations
>
> The future implementation will likely need to coordinate with linear support models, the frame stiffness kernel, solver diagnostics, and sparse solver behavior. Those are execution relationships for later work; this setup pass records them without editing other deliverables or implementing code.
>
> Convergence reporting needs enough information for downstream diagnostics and reports to disclose unresolved non-convergence, assumptions, and limitations. It must not imply engineering approval or code compliance.
>

### CLM-024 — Trade-offs

> ##### Trade-offs
>
> | Topic | Setup guidance |
> |---|---|
> | Scope size | DEL-04-04 is large but remains one numerical domain per ContextBudgetQA. Split only if later implementation crosses package boundaries or expands beyond nonlinear support behavior. |
> | Completeness vs invention | Prefer `TBD` over invented convergence tolerances, friction coefficients, or activation defaults. |
> | Diagnostic detail | Favor structured diagnostic/result fields over prose-only errors so AB-00-06 and OPS-K-SOLVER-2 remain testable. |
> | Test realism | Use invented mechanical examples sufficient for deterministic verification; do not copy protected benchmark tables or code examples. |
>

### CLM-025 — Examples

> ##### Examples
>
> Example cases are intentionally not specified in this setup pass. Future examples should use invented geometry, invented loads, and invented support properties, with explicit units and no protected standards content.
>

### CLM-026 — Conflict Table (for human ruling)

> ##### Conflict Table (for human ruling)
>
> | Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted sections | Proposed authority (PROPOSAL) | Human ruling |
> |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> | None | No source conflict detected in setup pass. | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
>

### CLM-027 — D-41 R5 T7 PDU-054 current declaration

> ##### D-41 R5 T7 PDU-054 current declaration
>
> Earlier setup-era statements on this surface are retained as historical setup context where applicable; this section is the active current-state declaration. The nonlinear support slice and DEC-067 Coulomb-friction basis (`±mu*N`) are implemented and evidenced. Broader nonlinear policies and validation thresholds survive only where explicitly recorded; this currentness declaration is not an engineering acceptance.
