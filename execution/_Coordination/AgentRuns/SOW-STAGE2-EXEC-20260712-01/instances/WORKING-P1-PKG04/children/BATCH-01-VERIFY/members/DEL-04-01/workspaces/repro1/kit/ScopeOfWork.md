# Scope of Work — DEL-04-01

## Purpose and Objective Traceability

This migration candidate defines `DEL-04-01` in service of project scope [SOW-005, SOW-035] and package objectives [OBJ-003].

- **OUT-001** — A 3D frame-stiffness-kernel contract covering six-degree-of-freedom node mapping, global assembly, coordinate transforms, boundary conditions, sparse-solve interfaces, mechanics-only result envelopes, and deterministic verification is produced for the declared scope and objective.

##### D-41 R5 T7 PDU-054 current declaration

Earlier setup-era statements on this surface are retained as historical setup context where applicable; this section is the active current-state declaration. The 3D frame kernel, DOF contract, dense solution path, and DEC-023 sparse evidence now exist in the implemented slice. Sparse-as-default policy and any broader performance/validation thresholds remain held where recorded; lifecycle remains `IN_PROGRESS`.
<!-- sow-source-end -->

- **AC-001** — The contract preserves the accepted frame-kernel requirements and current declarations, including unit and provenance boundaries, explicit missing-input and solver findings, rights-cleared verification data, and unresolved formulation, tolerance, sparse-policy, arc-pressure-thrust, and mechanics-assessment items without inventing engineering values or approval.

##### Prerequisites

- Confirm the active deliverable is DEL-04-01 and the write scope is the assigned deliverable or future implementation path explicitly authorized by a sealed brief.
- Read `_CONTEXT.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, `Procedure.md`, `_SEMANTIC.md`, and `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md`.
- Confirm applicable invariants: OPS-K-MECH-1, OPS-K-MECH-2, OPS-K-UNIT-1, OPS-K-SOLVER-1, OPS-K-DATA-2, OPS-K-REPORT-1, OPS-K-AGENT-1..4, and OPS-K-IP-1.

##### Steps

1. Reconfirm scope boundaries against SOW-005 and SOW-035.
2. Identify any implementation decisions still TBD, including DOF ordering, coordinate convention, sparse storage, solver library, error handling policy, tolerance policy, and reproducibility target.
3. If a TBD decision is needed to write code, record it as a required human/architecture ruling rather than guessing.
4. Define interfaces for model topology, six-DOF node mapping, frame assembly, coordinate transforms, boundary-condition application, sparse solve invocation, unit validation, and result/diagnostic output.
5. Keep straight pipe element behavior, supports, nonlinear supports, loads, stress recovery, diagnostics specialization, reports, and rule packs at their assigned deliverable boundaries.
6. Implement only from lawful, source-grounded mechanics and numerics references after the implementation brief authorizes code work.
7. Create deterministic unit tests before release use; use rights-cleared fixtures with explicit units and no protected data.
8. Ensure missing solve-required inputs produce explicit findings and do not become silent defaults.
9. Ensure output envelopes preserve mechanics/rule/human approval separation and do not claim certification or compliance.
10. Run protected-content and provenance checks before any release or handoff.

### CLM-024 — Purpose

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":15,"line_start":12,"source_sha256":"d4d165d289e6df840a249cfddc15ed39a56f25b3a42c49853ebdc76cd9b80ffb","target_id":"CLM-024"} -->
##### Purpose

This deliverable prepares the bounded implementation surface for the central 3D frame stiffness kernel. Its value is to keep global centerline mechanics, sparse numerical behavior, reproducibility, units, diagnostics, protected-data controls, and professional-boundary language aligned before code is written.

<!-- sow-source-end -->

### CLM-025 — Principles

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":24,"line_start":16,"source_sha256":"d4d165d289e6df840a249cfddc15ed39a56f25b3a42c49853ebdc76cd9b80ffb","target_id":"CLM-025"} -->
##### Principles

- Keep the global model line-element based unless a later handoff explicitly routes local analysis to shell/solid FEA.
- Treat six degrees of freedom per node as a scope fact, not as permission to invent an ordering or sign convention.
- Keep coordinate conventions, matrix storage format, solver library, tolerances, and benchmark targets as TBD until a source-backed implementation brief or human ruling seals them.
- Separate mechanics computation from rule-pack evaluation and professional approval.
- Use deterministic, rights-cleared verification fixtures. Do not use copied standards examples or protected commercial data.
- Surface missing values, singular/ill-conditioned states, and assumptions as explicit result-envelope findings rather than silent behavior.

<!-- sow-source-end -->

### CLM-026 — Considerations

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":36,"line_start":25,"source_sha256":"d4d165d289e6df840a249cfddc15ed39a56f25b3a42c49853ebdc76cd9b80ffb","target_id":"CLM-026"} -->
##### Considerations

The accessible source set is the decomposition, registers, contract, and local context. It does not provide detailed mechanics formulas, reference-element derivations, numerical tolerances, sparse storage formats, or benchmark thresholds. Future implementation must therefore source those details from lawful references or human-approved architecture decisions.

Architecture basis rows constrain the future implementation shape:

- AB-00-01 requires decision records for accepted architecture choices and reconsideration triggers.
- AB-00-02 keeps dependencies pointed inward toward domain contracts and preserves layer responsibilities.
- AB-00-03 separates commands, queries, jobs, result envelopes, progress/cancellation, and mechanics/rule/human approval states.
- AB-00-06 requires structured diagnostics and avoids certification/compliance claims.
- AB-00-08 requires layered solver tests and protected-content/provenance gates.

### CLM-027 — Trade-offs

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":46,"line_start":37,"source_sha256":"d4d165d289e6df840a249cfddc15ed39a56f25b3a42c49853ebdc76cd9b80ffb","target_id":"CLM-027"} -->
##### Trade-offs

| Topic | Current guidance |
|---|---|
| Sparse solver library | TBD. Choosing one now would exceed setup scope. |
| Coordinate convention | TBD. Must be consistent across element, support, load, result, and report interfaces. |
| Performance targets | TBD. SOW-035 requires sparse performance and reproducibility, but concrete thresholds are not available. |
| Verification fixtures | Use invented, rights-cleared, non-authoritative fixtures only after implementation is scoped; label them as test fixtures, not engineering examples. |
| Kernel boundaries | Keep element stiffness, support behavior, diagnostics, load application, and stress recovery in their assigned deliverables unless a human-approved change amends the decomposition. |

### CLM-028 — Examples

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":51,"line_start":47,"source_sha256":"d4d165d289e6df840a249cfddc15ed39a56f25b3a42c49853ebdc76cd9b80ffb","target_id":"CLM-028"} -->
##### Examples

- `TBD`: A future fixture set may include a minimal frame topology to test DOF mapping, but this setup kit does not define values, tolerances, or expected results.
- `TBD`: A future architecture decision may choose a sparse matrix representation, but this setup kit does not select one.
