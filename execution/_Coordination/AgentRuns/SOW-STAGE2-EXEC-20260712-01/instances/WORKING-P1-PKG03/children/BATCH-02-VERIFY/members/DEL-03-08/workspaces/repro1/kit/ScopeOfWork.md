##### Attributes

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Calculator purpose | Calculate pipe section and mass-property outputs from user-entered dimensions and material data with unit checks. |
| Permitted data source posture | User-entered or lawfully imported private/project data only. |
| Public bundled data posture | No protected pipe dimensional tables, material allowables, contents defaults, insulation defaults, corrosion allowances, or proprietary component data. |
| Unit posture | Inputs and outputs carry explicit unit and dimension metadata. Mixed units are rejected; approved conversion constants and public unit catalog remain `TBD`. |
| Provenance posture | Calculator inputs require provenance metadata, and derived outputs state that they were calculated from user-entered dimensions. Exact private-library record linkage remains `TBD`. |
| Solver boundary | This deliverable prepares section and mass properties; it does not implement the global solver, code compliance, or rule-pack evaluation. |

### CLM-004 — Conditions

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Datasheet.md","line_end":37,"line_start":28,"source_sha256":"9cb7b3a108a20b041249fadb711446517f7fbba09e9eeb622fb602055662fe2d","target_id":"CLM-004"} -->
##### Conditions

Implementation evidence exists in `core/section_properties/calculator.py` for user-entered pipe outside diameter, wall thickness, optional corrosion allowance, optional insulation thickness, and optional material, contents, and insulation density inputs. The calculator derives inside diameter, metal/cross-section area, second moment of area, section modulus, torsional constant, contents volume per length, and optional mass-per-length contributors when matching density inputs are supplied.

The implementation rejects missing required dimensions, missing provenance, incompatible dimensions, mixed units, and non-physical geometry through blocking diagnostics. It does not provide pipe schedule tables, material defaults, unit conversion constants, protected dimensional tables, contents defaults, insulation defaults, corrosion defaults, SIF/flexibility values, code-specific values, or proprietary catalog values.

Exact allowed public unit catalog, conversion constants, accepted schema field placement, dependency satisfaction, fixture-value policy, public source catalog, lifecycle disposition, and downstream solver/GUI/report integration remain `TBD`.

Mass-property tests use invented synthetic values in `tests/test_section_properties.py`. No protected published pipe tables, material tables, or vendor proprietary data may be encoded as test data.

### CLM-007 — Open Questions

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Datasheet.md","line_end":77,"line_start":62,"source_sha256":"9cb7b3a108a20b041249fadb711446517f7fbba09e9eeb622fb602055662fe2d","target_id":"CLM-007"} -->
##### Open Questions

Current implementation-form note: `PipeSectionInput` accepts an optional
dimensional `mill_tolerance`, and the calculator uses `wall_thickness -
corrosion_allowance - mill_tolerance` as effective wall. The input is
provenance-stamped and validated like the other dimensional slots; a fractional
or catalog-derived tolerance policy remains `TBD`.

| Question | Needed from |
|---|---|
| Which approved unit catalog and conversion constants, if any, may this calculator call? | DEL-02-02 / human architecture ruling |
| Which schema record owns calculator inputs, outputs, and library linkage? | DEL-03-02 / schema owner |
| What downstream result-envelope mapping is required before solver, persistence, GUI, or report integration? | PKG-02 / PKG-08 / human architecture ruling |
| What public source catalog and fixture-value policy is acceptable for section and mass-property tests? | Validation/QA owner |
| When may the technically addressed review findings move beyond human-gated `TBD` disposition? | Human project authority |

##### Scope

This deliverable specifies the bounded backend feature slice that calculates pipe section and mass properties from user-entered dimensions and material data with unit checks. It also records the private-library and provenance constraints that apply when those inputs are sourced from pipe section, component, or material libraries.

Current implementation evidence is `core/section_properties/calculator.py`, `core/section_properties/README.md`, and `tests/test_section_properties.py`. This evidence reconciliation does not edit code, repo-level schemas, fixtures, tests, lifecycle records, dependency registers, review dispositions, or DAG/coordination files, and it does not introduce protected dimensional, material, contents, insulation, corrosion, code, or vendor data.

##### Verification

| Verification area | Current evidence and remaining gate |
|---|---|
| Unit safety | Tests demonstrate canonical dimensions and mixed-unit rejection without hidden conversion. Approved conversion support remains `TBD`. |
| Missing input behavior | Tests demonstrate explicit blocking findings for missing required wall thickness and missing provenance; optional contributor policy remains `TBD`. |
| Provenance | Tests demonstrate provenance requirements at quantity construction/mapping boundaries and derived-output provenance. Library record linkage remains `TBD`. |
| IP/data boundary | Tests use invented synthetic values; formal source catalog and fixture-value policy remain `TBD`. |

### CLM-014 — Documentation

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Specification.md","line_end":52,"line_start":35,"source_sha256":"366084077ad985c16d16afab29c7228280d1bae3ec92b41b982c5038b01b77b1","target_id":"CLM-014"} -->
##### Documentation

Current implementation artifacts are:

- `core/section_properties/calculator.py`;
- `core/section_properties/README.md`;
- `tests/test_section_properties.py`;
- schema-like quantity mapping through `quantity_from_mapping`.

The current input form includes optional dimensional `mill_tolerance`. When
present, effective wall is `wall_thickness - corrosion_allowance -
mill_tolerance`; absence means no reduction and is not a hidden zero default.
Negative tolerance or a corrosion-plus-tolerance reduction that consumes the
wall is blocking. Fractional/catalog conversion policy remains `TBD` and no
catalog value or default is supplied.

Accepted schema ownership, dependency satisfaction, downstream result-envelope mapping, lifecycle disposition, and human disposition for review findings remain `TBD`.

##### D-41 R5 T2B PDU-047 Evidence Binding (2026-07-12)

`tests/test_calculation_witness.py` now executes `calculate_pipe_section_properties` with the existing rights-safe TP-PHYS-015 outside diameter and wall thickness, then compares the produced area, section modulus, and torsional constant to both the formal oracle and `tp_phys_015_section_property_stress_evidence_envelope.json` using the witness's existing tolerances. It also asserts the emitted units and dimensions. This is bounded validation evidence, not an engineering-validation or lifecycle disposition.
<!-- sow-source-end -->

- **AC-001** — The contract preserves accepted calculator requirements and boundaries, including user-entered or lawfully imported inputs, dimensional checks, no silent defaults, invented fixtures, unresolved conversion, schema, contributor, dependency, and human-review decisions, and no code-compliance or professional-approval claim.

### CLM-020 — Steps

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Procedure.md","line_end":29,"line_start":18,"source_sha256":"c30998ea0439c5e93b24f98216fdf26ab175be99d7ce916f91d85d5148db645e","target_id":"CLM-020"} -->
##### Steps

1. Confirm the task is sealed to DEL-03-08 and that write scope is limited to the authorized deliverable folder or separately authorized implementation paths.
2. Read current implementation evidence in `core/section_properties/calculator.py`, `core/section_properties/README.md`, and `tests/test_section_properties.py`.
3. Confirm calculator inputs remain explicit user-entered or lawfully imported values. Do not introduce bundled public dimensional, material, contents, insulation, or corrosion defaults.
4. Confirm validation behavior remains explicit for missing required values, missing provenance, incompatible dimensions, mixed units, non-positive required values, and non-physical geometry.
5. Confirm output shape preserves magnitude, unit, dimension, and provenance for section properties and mass properties.
6. Confirm tests use synthetic or cleared values only and do not encode protected/reference-table content.
7. Run `python3 -m pytest tests/test_section_properties.py` when feasible.
8. Run a stale-language search over `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, and `Procedure.md`; reconcile implementation evidence while preserving unresolved `TBD` items.
9. Record unresolved policy, source catalog, fixture-value, dependency satisfaction, human disposition, lifecycle, and downstream integration inputs as `TBD` and route them to the responsible schema/unit/diagnostic/human owner.

##### D-41 R5 T2B PDU-047 Check

Run `pytest -p no:cacheprovider tests/test_section_properties.py tests/test_calculation_witness.py`. Acceptance of this bounded witness requires the production calculator values, units, and dimensions to agree with the existing formal oracle and governed result envelope within the already-recorded witness tolerances. Do not substitute a re-derived test-only formula or select a new tolerance.

##### Purpose

This deliverable provides a bounded, unit-aware calculation surface for pipe section and mass properties while preserving OpenPipeStress data-boundary rules. The key distinction is that calculation from explicit user-entered values is allowed, but bundled protected pipe tables, material tables, proprietary data, hidden unit conversion, and silent defaults are not.

Use user-entered dimensions and material data as the source of truth. If a required value is missing, incompatible, unprovenanced, or not licensed for redistribution, record a blocking diagnostic rather than substituting a default.

Keep the calculator code-neutral. Section and mass properties can support solver and reporting workflows, but this deliverable does not determine code compliance, professional acceptance, or certification.

Keep unit behavior explicit. The calculator currently requires matching units at the calculation boundary and rejects mixed units; approved unit conversion support remains a separate `TBD`.

Keep provenance attached. Calculator inputs require provenance metadata, and calculated outputs identify that they were derived from user-entered dimensions. Exact private-library record linkage and downstream envelope mapping remain `TBD`.

### CLM-027 — Considerations

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":24,"line_start":17,"source_sha256":"bd40e4924d4fa8625b74a80007a18995234b395ad93cf5fcbe5a53c02ccf06b4","target_id":"CLM-027"} -->
##### Considerations

The most important implementation risk is accidentally turning public fixtures or defaults into a protected data table. Synthetic examples may be used for tests, but they must not be copied from protected standards, commercial catalogs, or proprietary project records.

The second major risk is ambiguity about optional contributors such as contents, insulation, and corrosion basis. Current code treats these contributors as optional explicit inputs; downstream policy still must define when each contributor is required, optional, explicitly not applicable, or pending user input.

The third risk is unit drift between schema, UI, calculator, and solver-facing outputs. The calculator emits canonical dimension labels in current tests, but accepted schema ownership, dependency satisfaction, and downstream result-envelope integration remain `TBD`.

### CLM-028 — Trade-offs

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":34,"line_start":25,"source_sha256":"bd40e4924d4fa8625b74a80007a18995234b395ad93cf5fcbe5a53c02ccf06b4","target_id":"CLM-028"} -->
##### Trade-offs

| Decision area | Conservative posture |
|---|---|
| Public default data | Do not ship defaults where provenance or redistribution rights are unclear. |
| Test fixtures | Use synthetic values designed for dimensional behavior, not copied industry tables. |
| Calculator scope | Calculate section/mass properties only; leave code checks and solver verification to their packages. |
| Schema timing | Treat hook names and exact field placement as `TBD` until schema contracts are accepted. |
| Review findings | Treat technical evidence as addressed pending human disposition; do not mark findings resolved without human action. |

### CLM-029 — Examples

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":38,"line_start":35,"source_sha256":"bd40e4924d4fa8625b74a80007a18995234b395ad93cf5fcbe5a53c02ccf06b4","target_id":"CLM-029"} -->
##### Examples

Current numerical examples live in `tests/test_section_properties.py` and use invented synthetic values to verify section properties, mass-per-length contributors, mixed-unit rejection, missing provenance, and invalid geometry. Additional examples must remain synthetic or clearly licensed/user-provided and must include units, provenance posture, and expected diagnostic behavior. Formal fixture-value policy remains `TBD`.

### CLM-031 — P3 Enrichment Notes

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":50,"line_start":47,"source_sha256":"bd40e4924d4fa8625b74a80007a18995234b395ad93cf5fcbe5a53c02ccf06b4","target_id":"CLM-031"} -->
##### P3 Enrichment Notes

Semantic lensing identified that diagnostic taxonomy, schema hook names, and optional mass contributors needed explicit treatment. The calculator now emits blocking diagnostics with diagnostic class, source, affected object, and provenance, and tests cover optional mass contributors when explicit densities are supplied. Accepted schema hook names, optional contributor requiredness policy, source catalog, fixture-value policy, dependency satisfaction, lifecycle disposition, human disposition, and downstream integration remain `TBD`.

### CLM-032 — D-41 R5 T2B PDU-047 Boundary

<!-- sow-source-begin {"disposition":"PRESERVED","file":"Guidance.md","line_end":53,"line_start":51,"source_sha256":"bd40e4924d4fa8625b74a80007a18995234b395ad93cf5fcbe5a53c02ccf06b4","target_id":"CLM-032"} -->
##### D-41 R5 T2B PDU-047 Boundary

The TP-PHYS-015 binding is deliberately narrow: it demonstrates that selected existing rights-safe section-property oracle values traverse the actual Python calculator and an existing governed result envelope. It does not approve catalogs, conversions, thresholds, broader mechanics suitability, or professional reliance.
