# Scope of Work — DEL-03-07

## Purpose and Objective Traceability

This Scope of Work defines `DEL-03-07` in service of project scope [SOW-019, SOW-044] and package objectives [OBJ-002, OBJ-004].

- **OUT-001** — A public/private library import-provenance checker contract covering source, license, redistribution, contributor and review metadata, privacy posture, unit preservation, quarantine, and diagnostics is produced for the declared scope and objectives.

## Deliverable Definition — Ontology

> | Status | Implementation evidence reconciled; lifecycle remains governed by `_STATUS.md` |
>

### CLM-003 — Attributes

> ##### Attributes
>
> | Attribute | Source-grounded value |
> |---|---|
> | Primary function | Validate already-parsed material, section, and component library payloads so source, provenance, license, contributor/reviewer disposition, redistribution metadata, privacy posture, and unit metadata are checked before import acceptance. |
> | Data boundary | Public component data requires documented provenance and redistribution rights; private library data must not become a bundled public default. |
> | Input format list | TBD. The implemented checker validates already-parsed payloads and intentionally does not parse external import formats. |
> | Rights determination authority | TBD. The checker can record and flag metadata, but legal acceptance requires human/project review. |
> | Protected-content response | Suspected protected standards or vendor content is quarantined and escalated rather than transformed into public data. |
> | Unit handling | Imported component/material numeric values must retain unit and dimension metadata; no unit defaults are introduced by the checker. |
>

### CLM-004 — Conditions

> ##### Conditions
>
> - Public data contributions are acceptable only when provenance and redistribution status are documented.
> - Import mechanisms must record source, provenance, and license metadata for component and material data.
> - Missing solve-required or rule-check-required values are findings, not silent defaults.
> - Public deliverable evidence must not include protected standards text, protected tables, vendor data, or real rights/provenance examples.
>

### CLM-005 — Construction

> ##### Construction
>
> Reconciled implementation evidence contains:
>
> - `core/library_import/provenance_checker.py`, a stdlib-only validator for already-parsed material, section, and component library payloads;
> - `validate_library_import(...)`, returning `ACCEPTED_PUBLIC`, `PRIVATE_LOCAL_ONLY`, `REVIEW_REQUIRED`, `REJECTED`, or `QUARANTINE` outcomes;
> - metadata checks for library-level and record-level provenance fields: source name/location, source license, contributor, contributor certification, redistribution status, and review status;
> - public/private disposition checks that block private-only or unresolved-rights data from public acceptance while permitting eligible private imports to remain local/private;
> - protected-content quarantine signaling for suspected protected or rejected sources;
> - nested numeric value checks that require unit/dimension metadata and value-level provenance;
> - `ImportFinding.to_diagnostic()` and `ImportValidationResult.diagnostics`, which project findings into a PKG-02-style diagnostic envelope with code, severity, class, source, affected object, remediation, and provenance;
> - `core/library_import/README.md`, documenting the boundary that the checker does not parse external formats and does not make legal conclusions;
> - `tests/test_library_import_provenance.py`, covering accepted public imports, public rejection for unresolved rights, private-local handling, missing provenance, protected-content quarantine, unit metadata, and diagnostic-envelope mapping using invented fixtures.
>
> Remaining unresolved items are concrete external import formats and parser contracts, accepted source catalogs and legal/license policy, fixture-value authority for engineering reliance, dependency satisfaction outside this bounded evidence, human disposition of review findings, and lifecycle closure.

>

### CLM-008 — Scope

> ##### Scope
>
> This deliverable specifies reconciled evidence for a backend feature slice that validates already-parsed public/private component, section, and material library payloads for provenance, license, redistribution status, privacy posture, unit metadata, and protected-content handling.
>
> It covers:
>
> - metadata presence checks for source, provenance, license, contributor/reviewer disposition, and redistribution status;
> - public/private data boundary checks for component, section, and material library imports;
> - diagnostics for missing provenance, unresolved redistribution metadata, protected-content suspicion, missing unit metadata, and review-required public imports;
> - PKG-02-style diagnostic-envelope projection for import findings;
> - provenance-focused tests using invented fixture payloads.
>
> It excludes:
>
> - concrete external import formats and parsers, which are TBD;
> - legal conclusions about whether a license grants redistribution rights;
> - protected standards text, copied tables, vendor data, or derived protected examples;
> - global solver, rule evaluator, or GUI implementation work.
>

### CLM-009 — Requirements

> ##### Requirements
>
> | ID | Requirement | Evidence basis | Verification |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | DEL-03-07-R1 | The checker shall require recorded source, provenance, license, contributor certification, review status, and redistribution-status metadata before a public component/material data import can be accepted. | SOW-019; SOW-044; OPS-K-IP-2; OPS-K-DATA-3 | `test_public_component_import_requires_accepted_public_provenance` and missing-provenance tests cover present/missing metadata fields. |
> | DEL-03-07-R2 | The checker shall flag or reject imports with missing provenance or missing redistribution-status metadata without creating silent defaults. | SOW-044; OPS-K-DATA-2; OPS-K-AGENT-1 | Negative tests assert diagnostic output, rejected outcome, and no accepted record. |
> | DEL-03-07-R3 | The checker shall separate public and private library handling so private project, material, component, and rule-pack data is not transmitted or committed publicly by default. | OPS-K-PRIV-1; OPS-K-DATA-1 | Tests distinguish public-import disposition from private-local records. |
> | DEL-03-07-R4 | The checker shall quarantine or escalate suspected protected content rather than paraphrasing, transforming, or accepting it into public data. | OPS-K-IP-1; OPS-K-IP-3; OPS-K-GOV-4 | Tests use invented markers only and assert quarantine outcome. |
> | DEL-03-07-R5 | The checker shall preserve unit metadata for imported numeric component/material values where such values are present. | OPS-K-UNIT-1; AB-00-04; AB-00-07 | Unit-aware fixture tests use invented values and verify missing unit metadata blocks public acceptance. |
> | DEL-03-07-R6 | The checker shall produce diagnostics/result envelopes compatible with the schema-first command/query/job boundary. | AB-00-02; AB-00-06; AB-00-07 | `test_import_findings_map_to_pkg02_diagnostic_envelope` asserts stable diagnostic fields and no bypass around import validation. |
> | DEL-03-07-R7 | The checker shall not make legal acceptance claims; unresolved license or rights questions shall remain review dispositions requiring human/project authority. | OPS-K-AGENT-1; OPS-K-GOV-4 | Tests assert `TBD`/review-needed style statuses for unresolved rights metadata. |
>

### CLM-010 — Standards

> ##### Standards
>
> | Standard or governing source | Applicability | Status |
> |---|---|---|
> | docs/CONTRACT.md | Invariant source for IP, data, unit, privacy, governance, and agent behavior. | Locally accessible |
> | execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md revision 0.7 | Scope and objective source for DEL-03-07. | Locally accessible |
> | External import format specifications | Potential parser/import constraints once selected. | TBD |
> | Legal license interpretation sources | May govern redistribution-right acceptance. | TBD; human/legal review required |
>

### CLM-011 — Verification

> ##### Verification
>
> - Run `python3 -m pytest tests/test_library_import_provenance.py` for accepted, private-local, rejected, quarantine, and diagnostic-envelope outcomes.
> - Use only invented, minimal fixtures for public tests.
> - Confirm accepted public imports contain source, provenance, license, redistribution status, contributor/review disposition, and unit metadata where applicable.
> - Confirm missing or uncertain rights/provenance fields yield explicit diagnostics rather than accepted defaults.
> - Confirm suspected protected content yields quarantine/escalation status and no public data output.
> - Confirm diagnostics do not include protected content excerpts.
>

### CLM-012 — Documentation

> ##### Documentation
>
> Implemented and reconciled artifacts are:
>
> - `core/library_import/provenance_checker.py`;
> - `core/library_import/README.md`;
> - `tests/test_library_import_provenance.py`;
> - active deliverable docs recording implementation evidence and remaining TBDs.
>
> Remaining non-implementation decisions are external import formats, public-source/catalog policy, fixture-value authority for engineering reliance, dependency satisfaction outside this bounded evidence, human disposition of local review findings, and lifecycle closure.

- **AC-001** — The contract preserves accepted public/private data boundaries, conservative missing-provenance handling, protected-content quarantine, unit and diagnostic requirements, and unresolved rights, vocabulary, source-catalog, and legal-acceptance decisions without creating legal conclusions or public defaults.

## Production and Verification Method — Praxeology

### CLM-013 — Procedure: DEL-03-07 Public/private library import provenance checker

> #### Procedure: DEL-03-07 Public/private library import provenance checker
>

### CLM-014 — Purpose

> ##### Purpose
>
> Define the procedure for checking and maintaining the implemented library import provenance checker while preserving unresolved policy, parser, review, and lifecycle boundaries.
>

### CLM-015 — Prerequisites

> ##### Prerequisites
>
> - Sealed context for DEL-03-07.
> - `_CONTEXT.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, and `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` revision 0.7.
> - Applicable invariants from `docs/CONTRACT.md`.
> - Implementation evidence in `core/library_import/provenance_checker.py`, `core/library_import/README.md`, and `tests/test_library_import_provenance.py`.
> - Human-approved decisions for license/redistribution acceptance vocabulary, public source catalogs, and import parser contracts before those fields are treated as project policy.
>

### CLM-016 — Steps

> ##### Steps
>
> 1. Confirm the import record type being checked is within material, section, or component library scope.
> 2. Confirm the record carries source, provenance, license, redistribution-status, contributor, and review-disposition metadata fields or emits an explicit missing-field diagnostic.
> 3. Confirm public imports with missing provenance or missing redistribution status are blocked, rejected, or marked not publicly acceptable.
> 4. Confirm private imports remain marked private/local and do not become public bundled data by default.
> 5. Confirm suspected protected content produces a quarantine/escalation diagnostic without copying or paraphrasing protected content into public data.
> 6. Confirm numeric imported values preserve unit metadata where numeric component/material values are present.
> 7. Confirm result diagnostics fit the schema-first command/query/job result-envelope pattern and expose unresolved items as `TBD` or review-needed statuses.
> 8. Confirm provenance tests use invented fixtures only and do not establish engineering reliance for fixture values.
> 9. Confirm review findings remain technically addressed pending human disposition unless an authorized human review updates them.
>

### CLM-017 — Verification

> ##### Verification
>
> | Check | Expected evidence |
> |---|---|
> | Metadata completeness | Tests for accepted records and missing-field diagnostics. |
> | Public/private boundary | Tests that private records remain private and public records require provenance metadata. |
> | Protected-content response | Tests assert quarantine/escalation status using invented markers only. |
> | Unit handling | Tests assert unit fields are preserved for invented numeric values. |
> | No legal conclusions | Tests assert unresolved rights questions remain review-needed/TBD. |
> | No protected examples | Fixture review confirms no standards tables, vendor data, or real protected examples are included. |
> | Review disposition boundary | Local review findings remain pending human disposition; no CSV status promotion is made by this procedure. |
>

### CLM-018 — Records

> ##### Records
>
> - `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, and `Procedure.md`.
> - `core/library_import/provenance_checker.py`, `core/library_import/README.md`, and `tests/test_library_import_provenance.py` as implementation evidence.
> - `_SEMANTIC.md` semantic matrix lens.
> - `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` lensing register.
> - `Dependencies.csv` v3.1 and `_DEPENDENCIES.md`.
> - `_run_records/TASK_RUN_*.md` records for the deliverable work sequence.

- **VER-001** — Validate the contract and review source parity, metadata and diagnostic coverage, public/private separation, unit preservation, protected-content quarantine, invented-fixture boundaries, and unresolved human or legal review items.

## Governing Values and Decisions — Axiology

### CLM-019 — Guidance: DEL-03-07 Public/private library import provenance checker

> #### Guidance: DEL-03-07 Public/private library import provenance checker
>

### CLM-020 — Purpose

> ##### Purpose
>
> This deliverable exists to connect PKG-03 library data models with the project governance boundary: component and material data may be imported, but public acceptance requires recorded provenance and redistribution status, and private data must remain private by default.
>

### CLM-021 — Principles

> ##### Principles
>
> - Treat provenance as required metadata, not optional commentary.
> - Treat redistribution status as a review field. The checker records and gates; it does not make legal conclusions.
> - Prefer explicit `TBD`, `REVIEW_NEEDED`, or equivalent unresolved states over guessed acceptance.
> - Keep public tests and fixtures invented. Do not use protected standards tables, vendor catalogs, or copied examples.
> - Preserve public/private separation at the import boundary and at any diagnostic/export boundary.
> - Maintain unit metadata for numeric engineering values; do not introduce unitless accepted records.
>

### CLM-022 — Considerations

> ##### Considerations
>
> - SOW-019 requires documented provenance and redistribution rights before public component data can be accepted.
> - SOW-044 requires import mechanisms to record source, provenance, and license metadata for component/material data.
> - OPS-K-IP-3 and OPS-K-GOV-4 make protected-content suspicion a stop-and-escalate condition, not a transformation task.
> - AB-00-07 indicates adapters must validate units, provenance, redistribution, diagnostics, and public/private boundaries.
> - Exact external import formats are still TBD, so this deliverable evidence describes already-parsed payload validation without committing to parser details.
>

### CLM-023 — Current Evidence

> ##### Current Evidence
>
> - `core/library_import/provenance_checker.py` provides `validate_library_import(...)` for already-parsed material, section, and component library payloads.
> - `ImportValidationResult` reports `ACCEPTED_PUBLIC`, `PRIVATE_LOCAL_ONLY`, `REVIEW_REQUIRED`, `REJECTED`, or `QUARANTINE`.
> - `ImportFinding.to_diagnostic()` projects findings to PKG-02-style diagnostic envelope fields for downstream compatibility evidence.
> - `tests/test_library_import_provenance.py` uses invented fixtures to cover public acceptance, unresolved-rights rejection, private-local handling, missing provenance, protected-content quarantine, unit metadata, and diagnostic-envelope mapping.
>

### CLM-024 — Trade-offs

> ##### Trade-offs
>
> | Topic | Preferred posture | Reason |
> |---|---|---|
> | Missing provenance | Reject, block, or flag as not publicly acceptable. | Avoid silent acceptance of unsupported public data. |
> | Unclear license status | Mark review-needed/TBD. | The checker cannot make legal conclusions. |
> | Private imports | Permit local-private handling only when privacy markers and storage boundaries are respected. | Supports private libraries without bundling protected data. |
> | Public test data | Use invented fixtures. | Prevent protected data from entering the public repository. |
> | Strictness | Conservative by default. | Scope item notes emphasize contributor certification and missing-provenance flags. |
>

### CLM-025 — Examples And Fixtures

> ##### Examples And Fixtures
>
> Concrete external import examples are not provided because protected/vendor data examples are forbidden and external import formats are TBD. Current test payloads are invented fixtures only; fixture values are not engineering reference values and do not establish a real license, provenance trail, accepted source catalog, or redistribution policy.
>

### CLM-026 — Conflict Table (for human ruling)

> ##### Conflict Table (for human ruling)
>
> | Conflict ID | Topic | Contenders | Human ruling |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | DEL-03-07-C1 | Exact license/redistribution disposition vocabulary | Source scope requires metadata and review, but no approved enum names are defined in this deliverable. | TBD |
> | DEL-03-07-C2 | Public acceptance authority | Validator can flag missing/uncertain metadata; legal or maintainer acceptance authority is not defined locally. | TBD |
> | DEL-03-07-C3 | Public source catalog and policy | The checker gates on metadata values, but no approved public source catalog or legal/license policy is defined locally. | TBD |
> | DEL-03-07-C4 | Fixture-value authority | Tests use invented minimal values; no fixture value is approved for engineering reliance. | TBD |
