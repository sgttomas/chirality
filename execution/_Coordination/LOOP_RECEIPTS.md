# Root Governance Loop Receipts

> **Epistemic status: derivative handoff ledger — not authority.** Append-only.
> Current state is always re-derived from live decisions, accepted snapshots,
> Git, project loops, and deterministic checks. On disagreement, those sources
> govern.

## Rules

1. **Pointer, not narrative.** Prefer artifact paths, decision IDs, commit
   SHAs, PR numbers, run IDs, and project receipt IDs.
2. **Owner directions verbatim.** Quote chat-only owner direction exactly when
   it is not captured in another governed artifact.
3. **Checks as summaries.** Record pass/fail and an evidence pointer; detailed
   counts belong in the evidence package.
4. **Map deltas, never rewrites.** Record a one-line pointer when a plan or old
   receipt disagrees with live state.
5. **Gate outcomes with reasons.** State executed, parked, failed, or awaiting
   owner and identify the releasing act.
6. **No simulated execution.** A brief, plan, or placeholder directory is not
   a child run. Cite only real `AgentRuns/<RunID>` records.
7. **Capped.** Keep each receipt to roughly 6–12 lines; put detail elsewhere.

## Receipts

### Receipt 0 — 2026-07-12 — Stage-1 candidate machinery prepared

- Basis: `origin/main@67ba77e5107f941e6fcc7382ef467b6b018e972d`.
- Worktree/branch: `chirality-sow-stage1` / `codex/deliverable-sow-stage1`;
  candidate snapshot `c4c5dd2df0d7b5424d48672c38d1eef37262e2f6`.
- Authority: owner instruction to implement the Stage-1 plan; pilot variance
  remains inactive pending D-GOV-15 ruling.
- Evidence: sizing report, four-document consumer inventory, proposed D-GOV-15,
  candidate standard, registered skill/tools, and App Dev feature-gated reader.
- Checks: root Python suites `347 passed`; App Dev `703 passed, 4 skipped`;
  typecheck, agent/skill/entrypoint/path validators, export regeneration, and
  `git diff --check` passed.
- State: `AWAITING_OWNER`; no pilot deliverable, `_STATUS.md`, historical
  receipt, TYPES, or SPEC content was changed.
- Release gate: explicit APPROVED/AMENDED ruling on the nine-item D-GOV-15
  slate and SHA-bound publication before any pilot worktree conversion.
