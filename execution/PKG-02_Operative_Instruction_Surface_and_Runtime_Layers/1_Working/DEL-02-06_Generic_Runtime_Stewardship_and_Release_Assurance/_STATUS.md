# Status: DEL-02-06

**Current State:** INITIALIZED
**Last Updated:** 2026-08-21
**Authorization Basis:** OD6-RT-SOW1 exact content acceptance (2026-07-27); OD6-RT-APP-INIT1 exact live-application and lifecycle-initialization approval; owner E1 preparation grant (2026-08-21) for one sealed WORKING_ITEMS activation at epoch `1` / candidate `root-runtime-1`; owner D1 exact-byte compatibility-completion acceptance (2026-08-21) at 14,191 bytes / SHA-256 `e5ae4e874bdace43720db082a9bd1ae3ff81b9e731264c65039b02d7f720467c`
**Application Basis SHA:** 9fa2f82ac4b9e55873bcd7cd99ca042a4456fea2
**Accepted ScopeOfWork SHA-256:** dc78196e96ec79d74b80b712bbc2e3d047a2e322e8c588497603ec426fbb0146

## Remaining

- REM-002 — OUT-001 through OUT-009 remain unproduced and AC-001 through AC-016 remain unevaluated.
- REM-003 — TBD-001 through TBD-016 remain the executable unresolved-item
  register from the accepted Scope of Work. D1 accepts the exact compatibility-
  completion package bytes but supplies no separate disposition of an
  individual TBD-* row in this status record.

## Dispositions

- REM-001 — `SATISFIED` on 2026-08-21. The owner authorized, and
  `DEL-02-06-COMPATIBILITY-COMPLETION-004` executed, one sealed
  preparation-only WORKING_ITEMS activation at epoch `1` / candidate identity
  `root-runtime-1`. The owner then accepted the exact prepared candidate at
  14,191 bytes / SHA-256
  `e5ae4e874bdace43720db082a9bd1ae3ff81b9e731264c65039b02d7f720467c`
  through immutable acceptance record
  `_run_records/DEL-02-06-COMPATIBILITY-ACCEPTANCE-005/ACCEPTED_COMPATIBILITY_SNAPSHOT.md`
  (SHA-256
  `f497cbbd8b9e7af454a82beae0aaed530374476ae6e97ff64195554c20cfe6b4`).
  D1 accepts those bytes only. All ten `HELD_UNAVAILABLE` bindings and the
  explicit implementation, cutover, lifecycle-promotion, release,
  publication, reliance, foreign-loop, and merge holds remain. This
  disposition changes no lifecycle state and evaluates no OUT-* or AC-* item.

## History
- 2026-07-26 — State set to OPEN (PREPARATION)
- 2026-07-27 — Exact accepted ScopeOfWork.md applied and validated as SOW_V1 (OD6-RT-APP-INIT1)
- 2026-07-27 — State set to INITIALIZED after successful contract validation (OD6-RT-APP-INIT1)
- 2026-08-21 — REM-001 satisfied by the owner-authorized preparation-only
  WORKING_ITEMS activation `DEL-02-06-COMPATIBILITY-COMPLETION-004`; state
  remains INITIALIZED and the exact prepared bytes require a separate owner
  acceptance act.
- 2026-08-21 — Owner D1 accepted exactly the 14,191-byte compatibility-
  completion package for `root-runtime-1` / epoch `1` at SHA-256
  `e5ae4e874bdace43720db082a9bd1ae3ff81b9e731264c65039b02d7f720467c`;
  REM-002, REM-003, all ten held bindings, and `INITIALIZED` remain.
