# Discovery basis and open work

Maturity: owner-approved entry revision; product-wide fulfillment remains unestablished. Use the
adjacent ScopeOfWork for commitments and evaluation; this note holds the source
assessment, design choices and limits of the current bounded work.

## Current undertaking

After setup was integrated at `11bdb448323877268c90296a5497fd71ede1baee`, the
owner selected the entry instructions as the first production undertaking.
The distinction clarified in that conversation guides this proposal:

- AGENTS.md supplies mature standing instructions, supplied to the agent each
  turn. Change it only when necessary or of tremendous benefit.
- init/init-prompt.md orients an agent at session start.
- execution/_Coordination/LOOP_INIT.md sets the project's course.
- coordinated-knowledge-work supplies the learned orchestration principles;
  the undertaking selects further methods as needed.

The entry prompt already locates Root, loads its standing instructions and
HELP_HUMAN, and reads the loop. AGENTS already supplies the working cycle,
authority, reconciliation and coordination route. The init prompt and coordination
workflow are retained unchanged. The owner's subsequent correction removes the
nonexistent PEC product from the live entry/recovery descriptions in AGENTS,
README, projects/FROZEN and the proposed loop; no archive is altered.
The loop is the principal affected holding:
its setup account is replaced by the current product aim, a route into actual
local work and the owner's content-review condition. The existing PRD,
decomposition, scopes and methods remain the sources of their own commitments.

Comparable public entry files were inspected at identified source revisions:
[App](https://github.com/sgttomas/chirality-app/blob/032725d32b67e117b8e1fb2b5fa9aa47b30de12e/loop/LOOP_INIT.md)
and [SWBPIPE](https://github.com/sgttomas/SWBPIPE/blob/bc9f7961acee72441ec06c104ed97d4f1c77faa4/loop/LOOP_INIT.md).
Their pattern connects current purpose and governing basis to the affected
locality. Their product-specific permissions, release targets and execution
arrangements do not become Root instructions.

Agent 0 is the single editor/integrator for this connected entry change and its
local reconciliation. A separate bounded contributor examines the proposal
against the preceding instructions before owner presentation. No consumer
adoption, publication change or new orchestration method is proposed.

## Available sources

The initial setup assessment used repository commit
`fd847ac9ac68250b2f35d2e9c0087c16e86b510a`; its result was integrated at
`11bdb448323877268c90296a5497fd71ede1baee`. The following holdings remain reusable:

- Root `README.md`, `AGENTS.md` and `execution/_Coordination/LOOP_INIT.md`
  provide the entry route. Setup connected the loop to the accepted decomposition.
  The current proposal makes the loop course-setting and links the actual
  discovery locality; neither change alone establishes all discovery criteria.
- `workflows/README.md` describes explicit selection, reading selected resources,
  source-qualified identity and collisions. `workflows/catalog.yaml` supplies
  library identity/central selection; `workflows/index.json` is generated from
  owning package metadata. Preserve those consumed surfaces rather than create
  a parallel inventory. Which entries fit a later brief still requires inspection.
- `docs/alignment-manual/README.md` provides a stable discovery route to a named
  edition. A source-dependent claim needs the resolved edition and revision;
  following a versionless pointer does not amend an accepted basis.
- `docs/thesis/README.md` labels the thesis as explanatory, nonbinding research
  and distinguishes its source/evidence standing from development authority.
- `tools/deliverables/README.md` states the actual Git/HEAD, Python and PyYAML
  prerequisites, explicit project selection and limits of query results.
  Direct source inspection is its documented fallback; it is not a Git-free
  implementation of the query commands.

## How the parts fit

Discovery starts with the undertaking's question, follows relevant references
and reads selected sources. A useful route can cross publications, instructions,
tools and local work without declaring a complete inventory or global graph.
An index locates a source; it neither decides applicability nor confers authority.

DEL-05-01 owns obtaining/version/update/compatibility guidance. This deliverable
locates and interprets that guidance for the selected inquiry. A shared README
edit needs one editor and combined examination of both contributions. Disputed
reference meaning goes to DEL-02-02, while executable query behavior belongs to
DEL-03-01. These boundaries do not prevent ordinary navigation work using the
existing maintained sources.

Formation material is supplied through the actual localities, with DEL-04-01
accounting for setup/reconciliation practice. Before presenting a current-work
link as usable, inspect that particular locality's scope, work and input
conditions. An accepted identity and a prepared directory establish less than
an authored, examined contribution. Do not wait for an entire supplier deliverable
to be complete where the particular source is already fit for use.

## Bounded discovery examination

The question is where to carry the owner's requested entry revision and what
would govern it. The session prompt leads through unchanged AGENTS and HELP_HUMAN
to the proposed loop. The loop identifies the accepted product/decomposition
basis and gives a concrete route back to this ScopeOfWork and Work. Search is
bounded to current Root scope files, not archives or an inferred global backlog:

```sh
rg -n 'LOOP_INIT' execution/PKG-*/DEL-*/ScopeOfWork.md
python3 -m tools.deliverables --project . neighborhood DEL-01-01
```

The first command locates the entry's output home. The second exposes the
declared input/use conditions and native consumers. Read their owning sources
before judging relevance or suitability. The accepted formation/localities and
maintained query guide support this entry case; the query's unknown-suitability
fields are not a refusal or a completion claim. Its references to shared-meaning
and consumer-use work are conditional: this proposal changes neither adopted
product contracts nor publication/compatibility claims.

The owner approved the presented proposal, including the corrected product lists,
with “Approved.” Independent review found no substantive blockers; its two
wording suggestions were incorporated before approval. The final checked revision
and integration are identified in the actual PR. This bounded examination does not establish
all publication traversal, command failure behavior, consumer qualification or
the complete A1/A5 result. The preceding entry supplied the review basis; this approved revision becomes
the adopted entry through integration.

Needs in `../deliverable.yaml` retain these cases and conditions. They
do not assert satisfaction or assign work to another contributor. Unknown
consumer qualification/publication bases remain with DEL-05-01 and matter here
only if the route repeats such claims. Additional archival disposition and
conditional tooling remain under their accepted authority limits.

The existing need conditions remain accurate for this undertaking and were left
unchanged. Code pointers now include AGENTS.md and init/init-prompt.md because
they are relevant entry holdings, including the unchanged session prompt.


## Fresh-reader maintenance route examination after the 60% decision

A bounded Type 2 contributor without inherited conversation context examined
how a maintainer should preserve workflow-package identity when revising an
explanatory companion, identify affected uses and leave the work recoverable.
The source basis was `047da79894bc5631dca564a30113f2cd26ec7ae1`; the loop also
contained Agent 0's uncommitted record of the owner's 60% decision. This was
first-use evidence for this brief, not an independent review or universal
usability claim. No package amendment was assumed or invented.

The route went from AGENTS and LOOP_INIT to a purpose search of current scopes,
which selected DEL-02-01. Its scope, Work and needs led through the workflow
guide and canonical package metadata to create-workflow. The manual index led
to Consolidated v9 Authorship/use and §§6.1–6.6. AGENTS directly supplied the
consumer and recovery routes. Reading those sources distinguished mutable
navigation from exact-content reliance, a content change from consumer adoption,
and recoverable historical work from authority to restart it. The contributor
found no substantive gap requiring a package or companion edit.

Actual read-only resolver, neighborhood and impact commands succeeded:

```sh
python3 -B tools/workflow_runtime/resolve_workflow.py --root . --role TASK --workflow create-workflow
python3 -B -m tools.deliverables --project . neighborhood DEL-02-01
python3 -B -m tools.deliverables --project . impact DEL-02-01
```

The resolver retained source-qualified identity and fingerprints. The direct
consumer view named DEL-03-01, DEL-04-01 and DEL-05-01; transitive impact reached
all six other deliverables. The contributor inspected conditions and treated
that breadth as a discovery lead, not an edit list or suitability verdict.
The optional execution.json was absent in the selected package; that matched
its documented optional status and required no invented companion.

The inspected v9 Markdown hash was
`e7efc7c22515f62964af344fe6058bab96240af3f9a96fe32323d10b8128b6f7`.
Its bytes matched the HTML's named rendering source at
`6472b49b2a6c7ebf4db1356d7bf83fa3af412305`. This verifies the selected source
identity, not a fresh rendering or visual examination.

For the unavailable-command case, one isolated subprocess set PATH to a
nonexistent controlled location; python3 was unavailable and returned exit127.
This was a labelled simulation, not an actual host outage. The contributor then
read the supplier YAML and the three direct consumers' declarations as the
documented fallback. Their conditions and triggers were inspectable, but this
manual reading did not reproduce transitive closure or prove complete coverage.
The host environment and repository source bytes remained unchanged.

Agent 0 retains the existing guidance on this evidence. The needed correction
is stale present-tense approval/standing elsewhere in the owning work, not a
new discovery method. Q-04/Q-05 are claim-specific: the named-reader and manual
cases in ConsumerBasis do not resolve every neighboring adopted-interface need.
Existing need conditions remain accurate and unchanged. This adds bounded
publication traversal and fallback evidence toward AC-002/003/004; it does not
claim all discovery, tool failure, compatibility or product criteria complete.

## Consumer entry after publication

The owner authorized simplifying the README and merging the result by PR. The
consumer route now precedes the background explanation, names the Project
Management Manual explicitly and places it first in a purpose-based selection
table. Courses, roles, workflow/tool guides and shared references retain their
existing homes. Explicit anchors preserve the prior shared-library, obtaining
and change-inspection links. Relative links follow the viewed source; the guide
explains selecting the published tag/archive for edition-specific use. No manual
body, role, workflow or acceptance criterion changes. First-use source inspection
traces version selection to the manual index, Markdown/HTML and required-resource
guidance; this is a documentation walkthrough, not agent or tool execution.

## Reflective successor discovery

The owner's later clarification places the book within reflection on Chirality
as practiced across projects. The approved README and publication index retain
prominence but remove the blanket instruction to start execution by reading it.
They distinguish the reflective successor from retained agent-directed
v9 and point external users to selected roles/workflows under local authority.
The old manual anchor still names v9; no edition or historical reliance is
silently redirected. This is an approved change in purpose/standing, not merely
a renamed link. The course entry has the same distinction; its lessons remain
at their existing source references. The current source characterization in
CLM-002 is reconciled, with other commitments and criteria unchanged.

## Independent book entry

The owner subsequently removed predecessor continuity from the book's framing.
README now presents its own purpose without a parallel earlier-manual pitch.
The publication index moves retained manual references into a historical section
while preserving their named anchors and source files. The book's thesis/case
sources remain available. The index distinguishes the revised maintained text
from the unchanged published first edition in library 1.0.1. This is navigation
reconciliation, not retirement of a consumer's selected source.
