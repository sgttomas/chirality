#### Conditions

##### In Scope

| Area | Threat-model coverage |
|---|---|
| Private project data | Local project files, model contents, result envelopes, report manifests, hashes, and user settings that may identify project engineering work. |
| Private code and rule-pack data | User-supplied rule packs, code-specific inputs, formulas, allowables, load combinations, rule-pack checksums, and source notices. |

| Plugins and adapters | Import/export plugins, scripting/plugin APIs, FEA handoff adapters, private-library importers, and external-tool interfaces. |
| Supply chain | Application dependencies, plugins, adapter packages, build artifacts, packaging/signing choices, and provenance of imported data. |

##### Out of Scope

| Area | Boundary |
|---|---|
| Legal sufficiency | This deliverable is not a legal opinion and does not determine redistribution rights. |
| Professional approval | This deliverable does not certify, approve, seal, or authenticate engineering work. |
| Cloud service design | Cloud operation is excluded unless separately authorized by the human project authority. |
| Detailed encryption implementation | Optional encrypted storage is noted as a product requirement; concrete key management remains `TBD`. |
| Exact plugin permission model | Plugin permissions, transport protocol, and external format list remain implementation-level `TBD`. |
| Protected standards content | No protected standards text, tables, figures, examples, formulas, allowables, or copied code data are included. |

#### Construction

This setup document represents the planned content for `docs/security/threat_model.md` without writing that repo-level product artifact. It is organized as a maintainable threat-model basis for later architecture and implementation work.

##### Threat Surfaces

| Surface | Representative exposure | Required model treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Local storage | Private project/rule/library files readable from user paths. | Record trust boundary, asset class, confidentiality risk, and storage-control questions. |
| Export/report | Reports, shared models, bug reports, result exports, and screenshots may carry private or protected values. | Record redaction, disclosure warning, provenance, and protected-content lint controls. |
| Telemetry | Diagnostic or usage collection could disclose private engineering data. | Record off-by-default posture and explicit opt-in/user-action requirements. |
| Plugins/adapters | Plugin, import/export, scripting, and FEA handoff flows could bypass validation or exfiltrate data. | Record no-bypass boundary, sandbox/permission questions, validation gates, and diagnostics. |
| Rule evaluator | Rule packs may contain private code data and expressions. | Record sandboxing, checksums, private/public metadata, and no arbitrary-code execution. |
| Supply chain | Dependencies, plugin packages, build artifacts, and importer libraries could be compromised or unreviewed. | Record provenance, dependency review, build reproducibility, and release-gate questions. |

##### Asset Classes

| Asset class | Public/private posture | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Public mechanics code | Public if original/permissive and protected-content clean. | Must not embed protected standards data. |
| Project model data | Private by default. | May include owner/project information, geometry, loads, results, and assumptions. |
| Rule packs | Private by default unless explicitly public/permissive. | Must carry source notice, redistribution status, version, and checksum. |
| Material/component libraries | Private by default unless provenance and redistribution rights are documented. | Public contribution requires provenance and review. |
| Reports and exports | Potentially private. | Must support warnings/redaction and avoid protected public templates. |
| Diagnostics and telemetry | Private-sensitive. | Must avoid private engineering/code data by default. |
| Secrets | Private. | Concrete storage and rotation controls remain `TBD`. |

## Component: execution/PKG-12_Security, Privacy, and Private Data Handling/1_Working/DEL-12-05_Security threat model/Guidance.md

### Guidance: DEL-12-05 Security threat model

#### Purpose

This guidance explains how to interpret and maintain the OpenPipeStress security threat model setup content for private data handling. The deliverable exists to make privacy, protected-content, report-sharing, plugin/import, and supply-chain risks visible before implementation details harden.

The threat model is a development artifact. It supports architecture and review; it is not legal advice, professional engineering approval, certification, or a compliance attestation.

#### Principles

| Principle | Guidance |
|---|---|
| Local-first by default | Treat ordinary modeling, solving, rule checking, reporting, and private-library use as local workflows. Cloud operation requires separate approval. |
| Explicit disclosure | Treat private data leaving local control as a user-intent event requiring warning, review, redaction, or explicit attachment/export action. |
| Private by default | Treat project files, rule packs, private material/component libraries, owner standards, diagnostics, reports, and secrets as private unless the user intentionally contributes or exports them with documented rights. |
| Provenance before reuse | Treat imported or contributed data without source/license/redistribution metadata as incomplete or suspect. |
| Sandboxed extensibility | Treat plugins, adapters, importers, script APIs, and rule evaluators as untrusted boundaries until validation, sandboxing, permissions, diagnostics, and no-bypass controls are specified. |
| Reports are decision support | Reports may disclose hashes, checksums, warnings, assumptions, and source notes, but public templates must not reproduce protected code text/tables or proprietary formulas. |
| Human authority preserved | Software statuses and reports must not claim certification, seal, approval, authentication, or automatic code compliance. |

Source basis: `docs/DIRECTIVE.md` sections 3-6, `docs/CONTRACT.md` invariant index, `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md`, `docs/SPEC.md` sections 6-8, and `docs/PRD.md` sections 17-18.

#### Considerations

##### Trust Boundaries

| Boundary | Why it matters | Conservative handling |
|---|---|---|
| User-controlled local filesystem | Private rule packs, material/component libraries, reports, and project files may coexist near public examples or source checkouts. | Separate public examples from private paths; warn on public/export destinations; scan contribution paths where applicable. |
| Report/export boundary | Reports, result exports, screenshots, and shared model packages may expose private project data or protected code-derived values. | Redaction, export warnings, protected-content checks, and explicit user action. |
| Bug-report boundary | Logs and diagnostics can disclose paths, project names, result values, rule-pack metadata, or private attachments. | Redacted default package; explicit attachment review; telemetry exclusion. |
| Telemetry boundary | Even coarse diagnostics can become sensitive if tied to private engineering work. | Off by default; opt-in only; no private engineering/code data unless user explicitly chooses a payload. |
| Plugin/import boundary | External code or file formats may bypass domain validation or introduce protected/proprietary data. | Validate through domain contracts; require provenance; sandbox where execution exists; record diagnostics. |
| Rule-evaluator boundary | Rule expressions may include private licensed/proprietary logic and must not execute arbitrary code. | Sandboxed, deterministic, unit-aware evaluator with private/public markings and checksums. |
| Supply-chain boundary | Dependencies, plugins, adapters, packages, and build artifacts may introduce malicious code or licensing/provenance gaps. | Dependency/license review, reproducible build gates, artifact integrity checks, and package provenance `TBD`. |

##### Update Triggers

Update this threat model when any of these change:

- Public API transport, plugin permission model, or import/export format list is selected.
- Physical project package/container, migration mechanism, or encryption/key-management choice is selected.
- Rule expression grammar/library or sandbox approach is selected.
- Telemetry is introduced, even as an opt-in feature.
- Report/export behavior changes to include new fields, attachments, copy paths, or templates.
- Build/package/release signing or dependency review policy changes.
- A protected-content, private-data, or supply-chain issue is found in review.

##### Open Questions

| Question | Current disposition |
|---|---|
| Should private rule packs or libraries be encrypted by default? | `TBD`; PRD notes optional encrypted storage and asks this as an open question. |
| What is the concrete plugin permission model? | `TBD`; no-bypass architecture basis applies until resolved. |
| What public API transport and import/export formats are supported? | `TBD`; schema-first envelopes are the current architecture basis. |
| What secret storage and signing-key process is used? | `TBD`; no real secrets may appear in setup or public examples. |
| What package/container format stores project data? | `TBD`; canonical JSON/JCS-compatible hash basis applies for JSON payload hashes. |

#### Trade-offs

| Trade-off | Conservative position |
|---|---|
| Usability vs redaction friction | Prefer visible warnings and explicit user action where private/protected disclosure is plausible. |
| Extensibility vs no-bypass controls | Prefer slower plugin/API enablement over adapters that bypass domain validation, provenance, diagnostics, or report controls. |
| Rich reports vs protected-content risk | Prefer identifiers, checksums, source notes, warnings, and user-private templates over public templates that embed protected text or formulas. |
| Local convenience vs secret safety | Prefer `TBD` and explicit secret-handling design over ad hoc credentials in project files, examples, logs, or reports. |
| Open examples vs realism | Prefer invented/public/permissive examples with provenance over realistic data copied from standards, vendors, or commercial tools. |
| Supply-chain speed vs review evidence | Prefer dependency/license/provenance review and reproducible package evidence over unreviewed package additions. |

#### Examples

These examples are invented setup scenarios and contain no real project data, real secrets, or protected standards content.

| Scenario | Threat-model interpretation |
|---|---|
| A user exports a calculation report for outside review. | The report path crosses the disclosure boundary; warnings, redaction options, provenance summaries, and professional-boundary notices must be present. |
| A user attaches a private project file to a bug report. | Default bug-report packaging should redact private data; explicit attachment should be treated as a user disclosure action. |
| A plugin imports a component library from an external file. | The import must pass schema, unit, provenance, redistribution, and protected-content checks before data is treated as usable. |
| A private rule pack is referenced in a report. | The report may identify name, version, checksum, and source note; it should not expose protected or proprietary rule content unless the user intentionally uses a private template. |
| A public example is proposed using vendor catalog values. | Accept only if redistribution rights and provenance are documented; otherwise quarantine or reject. |

#### Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A (file + section) | Source B (file + section) | Impacted sections | Proposed authority (PROPOSAL) | Human ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| None | No active source conflict was identified in this setup run. | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

#### Pass 3 Semantic-Lensing Notes

The lensing pass emphasized three conservative enrichments that are now represented in the documents: update triggers, explicit supply-chain treatment, and explicit plugin/import no-bypass boundaries. Source rereads used `docs/PRD.md` sections 17-18, `docs/SPEC.md` sections 1 and 6-8, `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md` sections 4-7, and `_CONTEXT.md` Architecture Basis Injection.


## Component: execution/PKG-12_Security, Privacy, and Private Data Handling/1_Working/DEL-12-05_Security threat model/Procedure.md

### Procedure: DEL-12-05 Security threat model

#### Purpose

This procedure defines how a bounded TASK worker drafts, refreshes, and checks the DEL-12-05 security threat model setup content. It is intended for deliverable-local setup work only and does not publish `docs/security/threat_model.md`.

#### Prerequisites

| Prerequisite | Required handling |
|---|---|
| Sealed deliverable context | Confirm `DEL-12-05`, `PKG-12`, `SOW-040`, `OBJ-010`, and the allowed write scope before editing. |
| Governance sources | Read `INIT.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/CONTRACT.md`, relevant `SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` revision 0.7 rows, register rows, and deliverable-local metadata. |
| Source boundary | Use only accessible source material; mark missing implementation details `TBD`. |
| Write boundary | Write only inside this deliverable folder. Do not create or edit repo-level `docs/security/threat_model.md`. |
| Protected/private data boundary | Do not include protected standards text/tables/data, real private project data, real secrets, legal sufficiency claims, certification claims, or professional approval claims. |
| Status boundary | Keep `_STATUS.md` at `SEMANTIC_READY` after a successful setup refresh; do not mark `ISSUED`. |

#### Steps

1. Confirm the deliverable identity and scope.
   - Read `_CONTEXT.md`, `_STATUS.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, `docs/_Registers/Deliverables.csv`, `docs/_Registers/ScopeLedger.csv`, and `docs/_Registers/ContextBudgetQA.csv`.
   - Verify the scope is limited to DEL-12-05 setup content.

2. Re-read governing sources.
   - Use `docs/CONTRACT.md` for invariant constraints.
   - Use `docs/PRD.md` sections 17-18 for private data, telemetry, report, and bug-report requirements.
   - Use `docs/SPEC.md` sections 1 and 6-8 for architecture, rule-pack, diagnostics, and reporting boundaries.
   - Use `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md` for provenance, quarantine, private data, and report boundaries.
   - Use `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` revision 0.7 for `PKG-12`, `SOW-040`, `OBJ-010`, and architecture basis rows `AB-00-01/02/03/04/06/07/08`.

3. Draft or refresh the four documents.
   - Keep `Datasheet.md` sections `Identification`, `Attributes`, `Conditions`, `Construction`, and `References`.
   - Keep `Specification.md` sections `Scope`, `Requirements`, `Standards`, `Verification`, and `Documentation`.
   - Keep `Guidance.md` sections `Purpose`, `Principles`, `Considerations`, `Trade-offs`, and `Examples`.
   - Keep `Procedure.md` sections `Purpose`, `Prerequisites`, `Steps`, `Verification`, and `Records`.
   - Label unknown implementation details `TBD`; label inferences `ASSUMPTION` if used.

4. Build the semantic matrix artifact.
   - Refresh `_SEMANTIC.md` using the deliverable perspective and the four documents.
   - Verify the final result tables for matrices `C`, `F`, `D`, `X`, and `E` have no algebra/operator leaks and no matrix errors.
   - Set or verify `_STATUS.md` as `SEMANTIC_READY` on pass.

5. Build the semantic lensing register.
   - Refresh `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` with complete `A`, `B`, `C`, `F`, `D`, `X`, and `E` lens coverage.
   - Record only warranted gaps, conflicts, or questions; do not treat lens cells as authority.

6. Apply warranted lensing items conservatively.
   - Re-read the target document section and relevant source slice before changing content.
   - Incorporate only supported items.
   - Convert unsupported items to `TBD` or add them to the conflict table.

7. Refresh dependency extraction.
   - Refresh `Dependencies.csv` using v3.1 columns.
   - Preserve human-owned coordination notes in `_DEPENDENCIES.md`.
   - Capture anchor links to `SOW-040` and `OBJ-010`, plus execution dependencies on governing documents that directly constrain the threat model.

8. Create run records.
   - Write one run record for each setup phase: four-documents P1/P2, semantic matrix, lens register, four-documents P3, and dependency extraction.
   - Each record must include `run-status: SUCCESS` or a concrete failure.

9. Run validation.
   - Run `python3 tools/validation/validate_dependencies_schema.py <ScopePath>/Dependencies.csv`.
   - Check `_SEMANTIC.md` for `MatrixError`/`MATRIX_ERROR`.
   - Check final result table rows for leaked algebra/operator tokens.

#### Verification

| Verification item | Method |
|---|---|
| Four documents exist | File presence check for `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, and `Procedure.md`. |
| Default sections preserved | Heading check for required sections in all four documents. |
| Semantic audit clean | Search `_SEMANTIC.md` for matrix errors and inspect final result tables for algebra/operator leaks. |
| Lensing coverage complete | Confirm `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` includes matrix sections for `A`, `B`, `C`, `F`, `D`, `X`, and `E`. |
| Dependency schema valid | Run the v3.1 dependency schema validator. |
| Status safe | Confirm `_STATUS.md` says `Current State: SEMANTIC_READY`, not `ISSUED`. |
| Write scope respected | Review changed paths before final report; no writes outside this deliverable folder. |

#### Records

Required records for this run:

- `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, `Procedure.md`
- `_SEMANTIC.md`
- `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md`

### Specification: DEL-12-05 Security threat model

#### Scope

This specification defines the deliverable-local setup content for the planned OpenPipeStress security threat model. It covers private data handling threats for local-first workflows, report sharing, shared model/export paths, plugins, imports, rule packs, private libraries, and supply chain exposure.

This document is not the product artifact `docs/security/threat_model.md`; it is the setup-stage source content inside the sealed DEL-12-05 folder. It must not introduce protected standards content, real private project data, real secrets, legal sufficiency claims, certification claims, or professional approval claims.

Source basis: `_CONTEXT.md`, `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` rows `PKG-12`, `SOW-040`, `OBJ-010`, architecture basis rows `AB-00-01/02/03/04/06/07/08`, `docs/CONTRACT.md`, `docs/PRD.md` section 18, and `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md`.

| OpenPipeStress `DIRECTIVE.md` stop rules | Binding stop/escalation rules for protected data, missing values, and overclaims. |
| OpenPipeStress `IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md` | Governing policy for public/private data, provenance, and quarantine. |
| OpenPipeStress `SPEC.md` | Technical baseline for layers, rule-pack evaluator, diagnostics, reporting, and acceptance semantics. |
| JSON Schema 2020-12 | Architecture baseline for future schemas/interchange; no schema is authored here. |
| External legal/compliance standards | `TBD`; not interpreted here. |

#### Verification

| Check | Acceptance signal |
|---|---|
| Four-document setup kit | `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, and `Procedure.md` exist with default sections. |
| Scope match | Documents reference `DEL-12-05`, `PKG-12`, `SOW-040`, and `OBJ-010` without expanding to unrelated deliverables. |
| Boundary compliance | No protected standards text/tables/data, no real private project data, no real secrets, and no certification/approval/seal claims. |
| Local-first posture | Cloud operation remains out of scope unless separately approved; telemetry is off by default. |
| Threat coverage | Threat inventory covers reports/sharing, plugins/adapters, imports, rule packs, private libraries, telemetry, local storage, secrets, and supply chain. |
| Open questions | Implementation-level unknowns are marked `TBD`. |
| Semantic outputs | `_SEMANTIC.md` has no matrix audit errors and final result tables do not contain algebra/operator leaks. |
| Dependency register | `Dependencies.csv` validates against `tools/validation/validate_dependencies_schema.py`. |
| Lifecycle state | `_STATUS.md` remains `SEMANTIC_READY`, not `ISSUED`. |

#### Documentation

The eventual product artifact should be `docs/security/threat_model.md`; this run intentionally writes only deliverable-local setup content. A later implementation or documentation task may promote accepted content into product documentation after human review.

Required records for this setup run:

- Four document kit: `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, `Procedure.md`.
- Semantic artifacts: `_SEMANTIC.md`, `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md`.
- Dependency artifacts: `Dependencies.csv`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`.
- Status artifact: `_STATUS.md` with `SEMANTIC_READY`.
- Run records under `_run_records/` for P1/P2, semantic matrix, lens register, P3, and dependency extraction.
