| Missing provenance or redistribution status | Emit provenance/data-boundary diagnostics and block public contribution paths when needed. |
| Protected or proprietary data suspected | Stop ingestion, quarantine/escalate, and do not import into public artifacts. |
| Rule-pack-facing hook | Preserve sandboxed, deterministic, unit-aware evaluation; do not expose arbitrary code execution. |
| Result publication/export | Use result/diagnostic envelopes and preserve report controls and professional-responsibility notices. |
| Private data exposure | Local-first by default; no telemetry or external transmission of private project/rule/component/material data by default. |

#### Construction

This deliverable records a contract boundary, not an implementation. The boundary is organized around these contract surfaces:

| Surface | Contract role | Setup status |
|---|---|---|
| Public API envelope | Common schema-first wrapper for commands, queries, jobs, diagnostics, provenance, and result metadata. | Baseline defined; concrete schema file layout TBD. |
| Model import/export boundary | Allows external data exchange only through schema, unit, provenance, redistribution, and private/public data checks. | Boundary defined; external formats TBD. |
| Solver invocation boundary | Routes solve requests through application-service command/job semantics with diagnostics, progress/cancellation, and reproducibility metadata. | Boundary defined; concrete transport TBD. |
| Results boundary | Exposes mechanical results, diagnostics, warnings, hashes, and rule-pack status without compliance or approval claims. | Boundary defined; result export details shared with DEL-08-04/DEL-10-05. |
| Rule-pack hook boundary | Allows governed rule-pack evaluation hooks while preserving sandboxing, unit safety, checksums, source notes, and private/public markings. | Boundary defined; expression grammar/library TBD. |
| Plugin manifest boundary | Candidate manifest concept slots include identity, version, declared extension point, schema/envelope compatibility, capability request, data-boundary declaration, diagnostics compatibility, and review status. | Concept inventory only; exact field names and permission taxonomy TBD. |

### Guidance: Public API and Plugin Boundary

#### Purpose

This deliverable gives later API, plugin, adapter, headless runner, result export, report, and security work a common boundary contract. It exists to keep interoperability extensible without creating a shortcut around units, provenance, diagnostics, public/private data controls, rule-pack sandboxing, report controls, or professional-responsibility limits.

#### Principles

- Treat the public API as a governed service boundary, not a direct tunnel into solver internals, storage internals, private libraries, rule-pack evaluator internals, or report-generation controls.
- Keep transport binding separate from envelope semantics. The envelope can be specified now; HTTP, IPC, CLI JSON, in-process library calls, or other transport choices remain TBD until approved.
- Prefer schema-first contracts and explicit `TBD` placeholders over invented endpoint syntax or plugin manifest fields.
- Let adapters translate external data, but require imported data to pass schema, unit, provenance, redistribution, diagnostics, and data-boundary checks before core use.
- Treat rule-pack hooks as security-sensitive. The hook may expose governed evaluation capabilities later, but it must never authorize arbitrary code execution by implication.
- Preserve the three-state authority boundary: mechanics solved, user-rule checked, and professional approval are distinct.

#### Considerations

The API/plugin boundary has two different audiences:

| Audience | What it needs | Boundary implication |
|---|---|---|
| Application services and GUI/headless clients | Stable command/query/job/result envelopes | Do not expose direct mutable domain-core internals. |
| Adapter and plugin authors | Extension points and failure modes | Deny by default; require manifest, capability, diagnostics, provenance, and review status concepts. |
| Project reviewers | Evidence that extension cannot bypass governance | Trace every capability to unit, provenance, rule, privacy, report, and professional-boundary controls. |
| Future implementers | Concrete enough contract to build against | Carry unresolved transport/runtime/schema-layout decisions as visible `TBD`, not hidden assumptions. |

Public API and plugin docs should avoid marketing language such as "certified", "approved", "code compliant", or "professionally accepted". They should describe computed states and human-review obligations using the project vocabulary in `docs/TYPES.md`.

#### Trade-offs

| Trade-off | Guidance |
|---|---|
| More public surface vs. safer core boundary | Start with fewer governed operation families and expand only when validation and privacy controls are defined. |
| Early OpenAPI file vs. schema-first envelope clarity | Because repository-level `api/openapi.yaml` is outside this write scope and public transport is TBD, keep the current artifact as an equivalent deliverable-local contract. |
| Plugin flexibility vs. no-bypass controls | Flexibility is acceptable only after capability declarations, sandbox behavior, private-data restrictions, and diagnostics are explicit. |
| External format support vs. protected data risk | External formats remain TBD until each adapter can enforce provenance, redistribution, protected-content, unit, and diagnostics gates. |
| Rule-pack integration vs. arbitrary execution risk | Rule hooks should expose declarative, sandboxed, unit-aware evaluation semantics only; exact grammar/library remains TBD. |

#### Examples

No engineering numeric example, protected standards example, proprietary vendor example, or copied commercial-software example is included here.

Acceptable invented boundary examples for later work are conceptual only. They are not approved schema fields, endpoint definitions, transport bindings, or plugin permissions:

- A model-import command envelope that contains schema version, unit system, provenance summary, private/public classification, payload hash, and diagnostic output slots.
- A solve-job request envelope that records model hash, solver version request, cancellation token concept, progress diagnostic stream concept, and final mechanics-result envelope concept.
- A rule-pack-evaluation hook that references rule-pack ID/version/checksum/source notice and returns user-rule status plus missing-input diagnostics without claiming compliance.

#### Human-Ruling Queue

| Topic | Current disposition |
|---|---|
| Final public API transport | TBD |
| Repository-level `api/openapi.yaml` or equivalent schema file layout | TBD; outside this setup write scope |
| Concrete plugin runtime and loading mechanism | TBD |
| Permission taxonomy and capability names | TBD |
| Exact import/export format list and priorities | TBD |
| Rule expression grammar/library | TBD; PKG-06/security decision path |
| CI/provider thresholds for API/plugin validation gates | TBD |

#### Semantic Lensing Hold Points

The setup lensing pass identified these review hold-points for later work:

- Future repository-level API artifacts need an approved path and schema/transport ruling before endpoint-level details are treated as implementable.
- Plugin capability grants need an approval owner, permission taxonomy, and sandbox/privacy review before any non-default capability is available.
- Conceptual examples remain examples only; exact fields, message shapes, and capability names stay TBD.
- Any exception to private-data deny-by-default behavior requires PKG-12/security rationale and explicit human approval.

#### Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted sections | Proposed authority (PROPOSAL) | Human ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| None | No source conflict detected during setup. Remaining issues are explicit TBDs rather than contradictory sources. | NA | NA | NA | Keep TBDs visible until human/project authority records decisions. | TBD |

### Procedure: Public API and Plugin Boundary

#### Purpose

Use this procedure to produce, review, and later refine the DEL-10-01 public API/plugin boundary without crossing into product implementation, external transport selection, plugin runtime implementation, repository-level API files, source code, package manifests, or protected/private data.

#### Prerequisites

- The sealed DEL-10-01 context is available in `_CONTEXT.md`.
- Governing documents and registers named in `_REFERENCES.md` have been read.
- Applicable architecture basis IDs AB-00-02, AB-00-03, AB-00-04, AB-00-06, AB-00-07, and AB-00-08 are treated as dispatch constraints, not copied as full PKG-00 authority.
- Current setup write scope is restricted to this deliverable folder.
- Public transport, plugin runtime, external format list, rule expression grammar/library, code-generation tooling, and repository-level `api/openapi.yaml` placement remain TBD.

#### Steps

1. Confirm identity and scope:
   - Verify the deliverable is `DEL-10-01` under `PKG-10`.
   - Confirm scope item SOW-030 and objective OBJ-009.
   - Confirm no edit target is outside this deliverable folder.
2. Inventory public API operation families:
   - Model creation/import/export.
   - Load-case definition.
   - Solve execution.
   - Result extraction.
   - Rule-pack evaluation.
   - Report generation.
   - Validation-test execution.
3. Classify operation semantics:
   - Mutating operations become commands.
   - Read-only operations become queries.
   - Long-running solve/report/export/validation operations become jobs with progress, cancellation, reproducibility metadata, and final result envelopes.
4. Define mandatory envelope slots at concept level:
   - Schema/envelope version.
   - Operation family and command/query/job classification.
   - Units and dimensional metadata where applicable.
   - Provenance and redistribution/private-public metadata where applicable.
   - Diagnostics with code/class/severity/source/affected object/message/remediation/provenance where applicable.
   - Result status using project analysis-status vocabulary.
   - Reproducibility metadata such as payload hash, model hash, solver version, rule-pack checksum, and input manifest references where applicable.
5. Define no-bypass rules:
   - Adapters/plugins cannot bypass schema validation, unit checks, provenance checks, public/private data controls, diagnostics, rule sandboxing, result envelopes, report controls, or protected-content gates.
   - Direct writes into domain core, solver state, storage internals, private libraries, or reports are not authorized by this boundary.
6. Define plugin manifest concepts without approving concrete fields:
   - Plugin identity/version.
   - Declared extension point.
   - Compatible schema/envelope version.
   - Requested capabilities.
   - Private-data access posture.
   - Diagnostics compatibility.
   - Review/status metadata.
   - Rule-pack hook posture where applicable.
7. Preserve unresolved decisions:
   - Mark public transport, endpoint syntax, plugin runtime, permission taxonomy, import/export formats, code generation, and repository-level API file layout as `TBD`.
   - Do not choose defaults without human/project authority evidence.
8. Check protected-data and authority boundaries:
   - Confirm no protected standards text, tables, copied formulas, proprietary vendor data, private project data, or private rule-pack content is embedded.
   - Confirm no wording claims certification, sealing, approval, endorsement, or code compliance.
9. Produce setup artifacts:
   - Four-document kit.
   - `_SEMANTIC.md`.
   - `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md`.
   - `Dependencies.csv`.
   - `_DEPENDENCIES.md`.
   - `_run_records/*`.
   - `_STATUS.md` with `SEMANTIC_READY` only after setup gates pass.

#### Verification

| Check | Expected result |
|---|---|
| Write-scope check | Only files in the DEL-10-01 folder changed. |
| Four-document check | Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, and Procedure exist with default sections. |
| Boundary check | No transport, plugin runtime, source code, package manifest, repository-level API file, or external format implementation is introduced. |
| Protected-data check | No protected standards content, proprietary commercial data, or private project/rule/component/material data is introduced. |
| Professional-boundary check | No certification, sealing, approval, endorsement, or code-compliance claim appears. |
| Semantic check | `_SEMANTIC.md` and `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` exist and preserve lens-not-authority separation. |
| Dependency check | `Dependencies.csv` validates against v3.1 schema and canonical enum values. |

#### Records

- `Datasheet.md`
- `Specification.md`
- `Guidance.md`
- `Procedure.md`
- `_SEMANTIC.md`
- `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md`
- `Dependencies.csv`
- `_DEPENDENCIES.md`
- `_run_records/TASK_RUN_*.md`
- `_STATUS.md`

#### Completion Condition

The setup sequence is complete when the required setup artifacts exist, dependency validation passes, semantic/lensing artifacts are internally consistent, unresolved decisions remain visible as `TBD`, protected-data/professional-boundary checks are clean, and `_STATUS.md` records `SEMANTIC_READY` without any `ISSUED` transition.

#### Verification

| Requirement IDs | Verification approach |
|---|---|
| REQ-01, REQ-03, REQ-04 | Architecture/API review confirms commands, queries, jobs, progress/cancellation, diagnostics, result envelopes, and governed service boundaries are represented without selecting final transport. |
| REQ-02 | Public API capability-family review confirms the PRD section 19.3 families are represented and that non-DEL-10-01 implementation work remains deferred. |
| REQ-05, REQ-06, REQ-07 | Protected-content/provenance review confirms import/export and plugin contribution paths require units, source, redistribution status, private/public classification, and quarantine behavior. |
| REQ-08, REQ-09, REQ-12 | Rule-pack/security review confirms no hook bypasses sandboxing, unit awareness, checksum/version/source metadata, private markings, or required-input blocking. |
| REQ-10, REQ-11 | Status/professional-boundary review confirms no automatic code-compliance state or certification/approval claim appears in API, plugin, result, or report outputs. |
| REQ-13 | TBD review confirms transport, endpoint syntax, plugin runtime, permission taxonomy, format list, code generation, and repository-level API artifact placement are not silently resolved. |
| REQ-14 | Reproducibility review confirms canonical JSON/JCS-compatible hash basis is referenced where hashes are required and non-JSON assets remain manifest-hash governed. |
| REQ-15 | Layered gate review confirms later concrete implementation will need schema, unit, provenance, diagnostics, protected-content, privacy, sandbox, report, and regression evidence. |
