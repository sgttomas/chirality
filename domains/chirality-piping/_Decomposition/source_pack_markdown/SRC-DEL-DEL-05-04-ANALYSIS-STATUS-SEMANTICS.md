#### Attributes

| Attribute | Evidence value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Primary subject | Explicit result/status semantics that separate mechanics solve state, user rule-pack check state, missing input state, and human acceptance state. | `_CONTEXT.md`; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` row DEL-05-04 |
| Mechanics status | `MECHANICS_SOLVED` describes completed numerical mechanics computation for a model snapshot; it is not a code-compliance statement. | `docs/TYPES.md` section 4; `docs/architecture/analysis_status_semantics.md` Usage Rules |
| Incomplete-data statuses | `MODEL_INCOMPLETE` and `RULE_INPUTS_INCOMPLETE` distinguish solve-required physical data gaps from rule-pack-required user/code data gaps. | `docs/TYPES.md` section 4; OPS-K-DATA-2 |
| Rule-pack statuses | `USER_RULE_CHECKED` and `USER_RULE_FAILED` describe user-rule-pack evaluation outcomes using user data and rule definitions. | `docs/TYPES.md` section 4; `docs/architecture/analysis_status_semantics.md` Authority Boundary |
| Human review status | `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED` is reportable for professional use; `HUMAN_APPROVED_FOR_PROJECT` is human-record-only and not emitted automatically by software. | `docs/TYPES.md` section 4; OPS-K-AUTH-1; OPS-K-AUTH-2 |
| Result-envelope interface | Status fields belong with schema-first command/query/job result envelopes and diagnostics, preserving mechanics/rule/human distinctions. Implemented evidence exists in `schemas/analysis_status.schema.yaml`, `schemas/analysis_boundary.schema.yaml`, `schemas/results.schema.yaml`, `api/api_boundary_contract.yaml`, and downstream result/report/headless surfaces. | AB-00-03; AB-00-06; `tests/test_analysis_status_schema.py`; `tests/test_analysis_boundary_schema.py`; `tests/test_results_schema.py`; `tests/test_api_boundary_contract.py` |
| Human acceptance workflow | TBD. External human acceptance records and storage/presentation ownership remain outside this deliverable-local kit. | `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` OI-007; `docs/architecture/analysis_status_semantics.md` Remaining TBDs |

#### Conditions

- Status records describe what software computed or found; they must not claim certification, sealing, approval, authentication, or professional code compliance. Source: OPS-K-AUTH-1 and OPS-K-MECH-2.
- Missing solve-required or rule-check-required values must be explicit findings and never silent defaults. Source: OPS-K-DATA-2.
- Human acceptance records, if used later, must bind to specific model, rule-pack, result, and report hashes and must not survive content changes without re-review. Source: OPS-K-AUTH-2.
- Reports must disclose solver/version, rule-pack checksum, warnings, assumptions, limitations, source/provenance notes, and professional-boundary notices. Source: OPS-K-REPORT-1.
- Setup artifacts are drafts/proposals until accepted by a human gate. Source: OPS-K-AGENT-4.

#### Construction

| Artifact | Description | Evidence status |
|---|---|---|
| Analysis status enum | Enum vocabulary for model incomplete, mechanics solved, rule inputs incomplete, user rule checked/failed, human review required, and human-approved record references. | Implemented in `schemas/analysis_status.schema.yaml`; automatic status enum excludes `HUMAN_APPROVED_FOR_PROJECT`. |
| API/result fields | Result-envelope fields that separate software status from external human acceptance record state. | Implemented evidence exists in `schemas/results.schema.yaml`, `api/api_boundary_contract.yaml`, `schemas/analysis_run.schema.json`, and `schemas/headless_runner.schema.yaml`; final integration ownership remains broader-deliverable scope. |
| Diagnostics linkage | Diagnostic class/status wiring for solve blocking, rule-check blocking, provenance, assumptions, and reportable limitations. | Implemented evidence exists in `schemas/analysis_boundary.schema.yaml`, `core/solver/diagnostics/src/lib.rs`, `core/rules/completeness_checker/src/lib.rs`, and report/result export modules. |
| Tests | Tests prove mechanics/rule/human statuses are distinct and no automatic compliance/approval status is emitted. | Evidence includes `tests/test_analysis_status_schema.py`, `tests/test_analysis_boundary_schema.py`, `tests/test_results_schema.py`, and `tests/test_api_boundary_contract.py`. |

#### Status Vocabulary Register

| Status | Status meaning | Authority level |
|---|---|---|
| `MODEL_INCOMPLETE` | Solve-required physical inputs are missing. | Software finding |
| `MECHANICS_SOLVED` | Numerical mechanics solve completed for a specific snapshot. | Solver result only |
| `RULE_INPUTS_INCOMPLETE` | Mechanics may be solved, but rule-pack-required user/code values are missing. | Rule-pack finding |
| `USER_RULE_CHECKED` | User-defined rule pack evaluated the result. | Software computation using user data |
| `USER_RULE_FAILED` | User-defined rule pack produced a failing result. | Software computation using user data |
| `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED` | Professional use requires competent human review. | Report/professional-boundary notice |
| `HUMAN_APPROVED_FOR_PROJECT` | A human recorded project-specific acceptance outside solver authority. | Human record only; automatic software emission prohibited |

### Guidance: DEL-05-04 Analysis status semantics

#### Purpose

This deliverable exists to prevent users, reports, APIs, and future agents from treating a mechanics solve, a user-rule-pack check, and professional acceptance as the same thing. The local kit should make implemented status evidence legible while preserving the boundary that lifecycle promotion and human/project acceptance require separate authority.

#### Principles

| Principle | Guidance | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Separate computation from judgment | Mechanics and rule-pack statuses describe computations and findings; professional compliance remains human judgment. | OPS-K-MECH-2; OPS-K-AUTH-1 |
| Missing data is a result, not a default | Missing solve-required and rule-check-required values must be reported explicitly. Do not invent values or silently bypass a check. | OPS-K-DATA-2 |
| Human acceptance is external | Human acceptance, if later supported, should be modeled as a separate hash-bound record rather than a solver-emitted status. | OPS-K-AUTH-2; `docs/architecture/analysis_status_semantics.md` Human Acceptance Records |
| Rule checks use user data | User rule packs may evaluate results, but public software does not bundle protected standards formulas or private project values. | `docs/SPEC.md` section 6; OPS-K-IP-1 |
| Reports preserve limitation context | Report-facing statuses should carry warnings, assumptions, rule-pack references, provenance, and limitations. | OPS-K-REPORT-1 |
| Local kit is not lifecycle approval | This folder records evidence, acceptance criteria, review history, and residual TBDs. It may cite implemented schema/code/test evidence, but it does not promote lifecycle state, release readiness, or professional acceptance. | `_CONTEXT.md`; `_STATUS.md`; OPS-K-AGENT-4 |

#### Considerations

- `MECHANICS_SOLVED` and `RULE_INPUTS_INCOMPLETE` can both be true for the same snapshot when mechanics outputs exist but user-rule-pack data is missing.
- `USER_RULE_CHECKED` and `USER_RULE_FAILED` are user-rule computation outcomes. They should not be renamed or displayed as automatic code compliance.
- `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED` is a software/report-facing boundary notice, not a failure.
- `HUMAN_APPROVED_FOR_PROJECT` is reserved for external human acceptance records. Implemented and future ordinary solve, rule-check, import, and report-generation code paths should prevent this value from appearing as automatic software status.
- `CODE_COMPLIANT` is not an allowed automatic status per `docs/TYPES.md`.
- Implemented schema/API/result surfaces should continue to expose only automatic software statuses in ordinary software output; external human acceptance remains a hash-bound reference or record.

#### Trade-offs

| Trade-off | Guidance |
|---|---|
| Single enum vs status dimensions | A single enum is simple, but multiple statuses may truthfully coexist. Implemented and future surfaces should preserve coexistence where sources allow it. |
| Human approval label vs separate record | A label is easy to display, but a separate record is needed to bind acceptance to reviewed content hashes and prevent stale reliance. |
| Rule-pack checked vs rule-pack passed | The sources define checked and failed outcomes; pass semantics should be treated carefully and tied to user-defined rule outputs, not professional acceptance. |

#### Vocabulary Notes

- Use `mechanics solved` for open-mechanics computation completion only.
- Use `rule inputs incomplete` when a rule pack cannot evaluate because user/code/project data is missing.
- Use `user rule checked` or `user rule failed` for user-rule-pack computation outcomes.
- Use `human review required` as a report/professional-boundary notice.
- Use `human approved for project` only as an external human acceptance record reference, never as an automatically emitted software result.
- Reports may reference rule-pack identity and checksums, but public artifacts must not reproduce protected formulas or private values.

#### Examples

| Scenario | Appropriate status interpretation |
|---|---|
| Missing pipe section dimensions prevent solving. | `MODEL_INCOMPLETE`; do not invent defaults. |
| Displacements/reactions/stresses are computed, but a rule pack needs a missing owner allowable. | `MECHANICS_SOLVED` plus `RULE_INPUTS_INCOMPLETE`. |
| A user rule pack runs and returns at least one failing check. | `USER_RULE_FAILED` with rule-pack identity/version/checksum and diagnostics. |
| A calculation report is exported for professional use. | Include `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED` and professional-boundary notice. |
| A competent human later accepts a specific report package. | External hash-bound human acceptance record; not automatic software approval. |

#### Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted sections | Proposed authority (PROPOSAL) | Human ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| None | No source conflict identified during current evidence alignment. | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | TBD |

#### Open Questions

| Open item | Status |
|---|---|
| Exact ownership of all schema/API/result integration points across downstream deliverables. | Partly implemented; integration ownership remains deliverable-specific |
| Storage owner and UI presentation for external human acceptance records. | TBD |
| Canonicalization edge cases for non-JSON payload hashes referenced by human records. | TBD |
| Whether a positive user-rule outcome needs an explicit `USER_RULE_PASSED` value or remains represented by `USER_RULE_CHECKED` plus check details. | TBD |
| Human acceptance workflow details remain TBD because automatic software authority is prohibited and any accepted record must bind to reviewed hashes. | TBD |

## Component: execution/PKG-05_Loads, Load Cases, and Stress Recovery/1_Working/DEL-05-04_Analysis status semantics/Procedure.md

### Procedure: DEL-05-04 Analysis status semantics

#### Purpose

Define the procedure for maintaining DEL-05-04 analysis status semantics evidence after bounded implementation. Product code remains outside this deliverable folder, but the local kit may cite implemented schemas, code, tests, and downstream consumers as evidence.

#### Prerequisites

| Prerequisite | Source |
|---|---|
| Sealed DEL-05-04 context with write scope limited to this deliverable folder. | `_CONTEXT.md`; OPS-K-AGENT-3 |
| Decomposition revision 0.7 and register rows for DEL-05-04, SOW-047, OBJ-005, and OBJ-011. | `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md`; registers |
| Applicable architecture basis IDs AB-00-01, AB-00-02, AB-00-03, AB-00-06, and AB-00-08. | `_CONTEXT.md` Architecture Basis Injection |
| Invariant catalog slices for authority, mechanics/rule separation, missing data, reports, and agent boundaries. | `docs/CONTRACT.md` |
| Analysis status vocabulary, architecture note, schemas, and tests. | `docs/TYPES.md`; `docs/architecture/analysis_status_semantics.md`; `schemas/analysis_status.schema.yaml`; `tests/test_analysis_status_schema.py` |

#### Steps

| Step | Action | Evidence/record |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Read the sealed context and confirm the deliverable is DEL-05-04 / PKG-05 / SOW-047. | `_CONTEXT.md`; run record |
| 2 | Read governing vocabulary and invariants for analysis statuses, authority boundaries, missing data, report provenance, and human acceptance records. | `docs/TYPES.md`; `docs/CONTRACT.md`; architecture note |
| 3 | Maintain the four-document kit as deliverable-local evidence for the analysis-status state model. | `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, `Procedure.md` |
| 4 | Build the semantic matrix lens as question-shaping evidence, not engineering authority. | `_SEMANTIC.md` |
| 5 | Build the semantic lensing register and capture warranted gaps/questions with `HumanRuling=TBD`. | `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` |
| 6 | Apply only source-supported Pass 3 refinements, preserving unresolved items as `TBD`. | Four documents and run record |
| 7 | Extract dependency anchors and information-flow constraints conservatively. | `Dependencies.csv`; `_DEPENDENCIES.md` |
| 8 | Validate dependency/schema evidence as needed and keep `_STATUS.md` unchanged unless a human explicitly authorizes a lifecycle gate. | Validation output; `_STATUS.md` |

#### Implementation Evidence Fixture Selection

When maintaining or extending implementation evidence, select tests that demonstrate:

- `MECHANICS_SOLVED` can coexist with `RULE_INPUTS_INCOMPLETE`;
- missing physical solve inputs emit `MODEL_INCOMPLETE`;
- rule-pack evaluation can emit checked or failed outcomes without compliance claims;
- `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED` appears for reportable results;
- `HUMAN_APPROVED_FOR_PROJECT` cannot be emitted by ordinary software execution and cannot survive bound-content hash changes.

#### Verification

| Check | Expected result |
|---|---|
| Four-document kit exists | `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, and `Procedure.md` are present. |
| Local write boundary | No schema, API, Rust, TypeScript, GUI, or test implementation files are created or edited inside this deliverable-local maintenance tranche. |
| Status distinction preserved | Mechanics, rule-pack, incomplete-data, and human-acceptance statuses remain distinct. |
| Human approval boundary preserved | Automatic software approval/compliance claims are absent; human acceptance remains external and `TBD` where unresolved. |
| Dependency register valid | `Dependencies.csv` conforms to v3.1 required columns and `_DEPENDENCIES.md` counts match. |
| Lifecycle safe | `_STATUS.md` remains under human lifecycle authority and is not changed by evidence alignment. |

## Component: execution/PKG-05_Loads, Load Cases, and Stress Recovery/1_Working/DEL-05-04_Analysis status semantics/Specification.md

### Specification: DEL-05-04 Analysis status semantics

#### Scope

This deliverable specifies the analysis-status semantics used by result envelopes and related boundaries. It covers status distinctions among mechanics solved, rule-pack checked or blocked by incomplete rule inputs, incomplete solve data, and human-approved/not-human-approved records. Implemented evidence exists for the schema vocabulary, result/API fields, boundary tests, and downstream consumers. Lifecycle promotion, release readiness, GUI acceptance workflow ownership, report rendering acceptance, and professional approval remain outside this deliverable-local kit.
