#### Conditions

| Condition | Required handling |
|---|---|
| A private library path is registered | The registry records an opaque path reference, privacy classification, provenance summary, redistribution status, checksum status, and default transmission prohibition. Exact path storage mechanics remain `TBD`. |
| A credential is needed for import or private storage | The product records an opaque credential reference and required permission, not a credential value. The concrete local secret provider remains `TBD`. |
| A private library is exported, attached to a bug report, or included in a shared model/report | The product warns, redacts or omits private values unless the user explicitly requests inclusion under their responsibility. |
| Provenance or redistribution status is missing | The product emits a provenance/private-data diagnostic and does not silently treat the asset as public. |
| Protected or proprietary content is suspected | Ingestion or publication is stopped, the artifact is quarantined outside public examples, and human/legal review is required. |
| A plugin or adapter requests private-library access | Access is denied unless a permission grant exists; plugins and adapters cannot bypass schema, unit, provenance, privacy, protected-content, diagnostic, or report controls. |
| Cloud transmission or telemetry is proposed | It is out of this deliverable unless separately approved; telemetry is off by default and must not include private engineering data. |
| Runtime provider, storage, or approval mechanics are requested | Exact secret provider, encrypted-storage default, storage roots, permission grant persistence, physical project package/container, public API transport, cloud/network behavior, external secret manager behavior, and approval choices remain `TBD` or deferred to owning workflows. |

#### Construction

##### Private Library Registry Record

Minimum registry fields for this deliverable are descriptive and implementation-facing, not final schema commitments:

| Field | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `library_id` | Stable local identifier for a private library record | PROPOSAL |
| `library_kind` | Private rule pack, material library, component library, owner design basis, or project-local library category | PROPOSAL |
| `path_ref` | Opaque local path or storage reference; does not expose secret material | PROPOSAL |
| `privacy_classification` | Marks private/public/export posture | PROPOSAL |
| `redistribution_status` | Records private-only, public-permissive, unknown, or protected-suspected posture using project vocabulary | PROPOSAL |
| `source_provenance` | Source/provenance summary without protected tables or formulas | PROPOSAL |
| `checksum` | Hash/checksum reference when available | PROPOSAL |
| `credential_ref` | Optional opaque credential reference; never a credential value | PROPOSAL |
| `default_transmission_allowed` | Defaults to false for private assets | PROPOSAL |
| `review_status` | Pending, accepted, rejected, quarantined, or `TBD` review disposition | PROPOSAL |

##### Current Secret Handling Evidence

June 7 evidence records focused invented-fixture tests for current metadata-only guard behavior. These tests do not create real secret storage, runtime private-library storage, cloud/network behavior, external secret-manager integration, legal clearance, security certification, professional approval, or code-compliance approval.

| Test area | Expected evidence |
|---|---|
| Registry rejects secret values | Fixture contains only non-secret sentinel markers and opaque references. |
| Export redaction | Private values are omitted or replaced by non-sensitive markers in report/share paths. |
| Telemetry exclusion | Private-library and credential-reference fields are not included in telemetry payloads. |
| Permission denial | Plugin/adapter access to private libraries and secret references fails closed without explicit grant. |
| Quarantine routing | Suspected protected/private content entering a public contribution path emits a diagnostic and routes to review. |
| June 7 marker hardening | Tests cover payload markers, cloud/network markers, external secret-manager markers, direct SQL/raw SQLite markers, storage-bypass markers, and concrete path reduction to safe metadata. |

## Component: execution/PKG-12_Security, Privacy, and Private Data Handling/1_Working/DEL-12-04_Secret and private-library handling/Guidance.md

### Guidance: DEL-12-04 Secret and private-library handling

#### Purpose

This deliverable gives downstream implementation work a bounded, local-first privacy control surface for private libraries and credential references. It exists so OpenPipeStress can support user-owned rule packs, material libraries, component libraries, owner design bases, and project models without treating private or protected content as public repository data.

Sources: `_CONTEXT.md`; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` SOW-029, SOW-040, and OBJ-010; `docs/PRD.md` sections 17.3 and 18.3.

#### Current Evidence Boundary

June 7 evidence shows DEL-12-04 now has a metadata-only helper, public-boundary documentation, and focused invented-fixture tests:

- `core/security/secret_private_library/` classifies private-library, private-path, and credential-reference metadata without reading referenced files or storing payloads.
- `docs/security/secret_private_library_handling.md` records metadata-only guard behavior and non-authority boundaries.
- `tests/security/test_secret_private_library_handling.py` covers private reference metadata, public fixture blocking, redaction/export release contexts, telemetry exclusion markers, concrete path reduction, cloud/network markers, external secret-manager markers, direct SQL/raw SQLite markers, and storage-bypass markers.
- `_run_records/TASK_RUN_2026-06-07_0942_secret-private-library-alignment.md` and package fan-in `WORKING_ITEMS_RUN_2026-06-07_0957_TP-PKG12-REDACTION-SECRET-GUARD-CLOSEOUT.md` record passing focused and paired PKG-12 validation.

This evidence does not finalize exact secret provider, encrypted-storage default, storage roots, permission grant persistence, physical project package/container, public API transport, cloud/network behavior, external secret manager behavior, approval choices, legal sufficiency, security certification, professional approval, or code-compliance status.

#### Principles

| Principle | Guidance | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Local-first by default | Private-library handling should not require cloud operation, cloud storage, telemetry, or external network access. | `docs/PRD.md` section 18.1 |
| References over secrets | Store opaque references to credentials and private library locations, not usable secret material. | ASSUMPTION from `docs/PRD.md` section 18.3 and plugin permission controls |
| Private unless proven public | Unknown provenance or redistribution status should not be promoted to public-safe. | `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md` sections 4 and 6 |
| Fail closed at boundaries | Imports, exports, report generation, bug reports, telemetry, plugin access, and public contribution flows should block, redact, warn, or quarantine when privacy status is uncertain. | `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md` section 5; `docs/architecture/plugin_boundary.md` Private Data Handling |
| Metadata without disclosure | Reports and exported payloads may reference private rule packs or libraries by identity/version/checksum/source note without exposing protected formulas or private values. | `docs/PRD.md` sections 15.2 and 17.3 |
| No-bypass architecture | Adapters and plugins are translators; they cannot bypass validation, provenance, privacy, diagnostics, checksums, rule sandboxing, or report controls. | AB-00-02, AB-00-06, AB-00-07; `docs/architecture/extension_domain_contracts.md` No-Bypass Rules |

#### Considerations

- A private library registry should be treated as a control surface, not a data dump. It should carry enough metadata to validate, warn, hash, redact, and route assets without exposing private values.
- The exact physical project package/container and local secret provider remain `TBD`; this deliverable should not lock the product to one platform mechanism without human approval.
- Current and future secret handling tests should use non-sensitive sentinel markers and fixture-only paths, not realistic tokens, passwords, API keys, owner data, material tables, or private component values.
- Optional encrypted storage for private libraries is called out by the PRD but not fully specified. Treat encryption defaults, key lifecycle, recovery, and platform storage as human/architecture decisions still requiring a later implementation brief.
- A checksum identifies a referenced artifact or payload. It is not permission to expose the artifact and does not make protected/private content public.
- Public examples may use invented data only. They should not be made more realistic by copying standards tables, proprietary formulas, commercial examples, or private owner data.

#### Trade-offs

| Tension | Conservative posture |
|---|---|
| Detailed registry fields vs. unresolved schema layout | Specify required metadata semantics now; leave exact schema file placement and code-generation details `TBD`. |
| User convenience vs. accidental disclosure | Prefer explicit warning, redaction, quarantine, or permission grant over silent inclusion. |
| Report reproducibility vs. private-content exposure | Include identity/version/checksum/source-note references; omit formulas, protected values, and private library contents by default. |
| Plugin extensibility vs. privacy boundary | Use denied-by-default permissions and no-bypass rules. |
| Local encryption expectations vs. platform variability | Record optional encrypted storage as required consideration, not as a completed design. |
| Current metadata-only evidence vs. runtime storage authority | Treat the helper/tests as readiness evidence for guard semantics only; do not infer runtime storage roots, secret provider, permission grant persistence, cloud/network behavior, or approval authority. |

#### Examples

The following are non-sensitive behavior examples only. They intentionally avoid real credentials, real private paths, real project data, and protected standards content.

| Scenario | Expected behavior |
|---|---|
| A user registers a private material library | The registry marks it private, records provenance and redistribution status, stores an opaque local reference, and prevents default telemetry/export inclusion. |
| A private rule pack is referenced in a report | The report can show rule-pack identity, version, checksum, source note, warnings, and missing-input findings without embedding protected formulas or private values. |
| A plugin requests private-library read access | The request is denied unless a grant exists; denial emits a diagnostic instead of bypassing the application service boundary. |
| Imported data appears to be copied protected content | Import/publication stops, the record is marked suspected, and human review is required before public use. |
| A test fixture needs credential behavior | The fixture uses a non-sensitive placeholder reference and asserts that no usable secret value is persisted or emitted. |

#### Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted sections | Proposed authority (PROPOSAL) | Human ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEL-12-04-CF-001 | Exact local secret provider and encrypted-storage default are not specified. | `docs/PRD.md` section 18.3 | `docs/architecture/plugin_boundary.md` Remaining TBDs | Specification Requirements; Procedure Steps | Keep provider/encryption mechanics `TBD`; require opaque secret references and no real secrets in artifacts now. | TBD |
| DEL-12-04-CF-002 | Current metadata-only helper/tests exist, but runtime storage roots, permission grant persistence, physical project package/container, public API transport, cloud/network behavior, external secret manager behavior, and approval choices remain unresolved. | June 7 DEL-12-04 TASK run and package fan-in | `_CONTEXT.md` architecture-basis `Still TBD`; `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md` private user data policy | Specification Verification; Procedure Verification; Dependencies | Treat current controls as readiness evidence only and carry unresolved mechanics as non-blocking deferrals for owning workflows. | TBD |

## Component: execution/PKG-12_Security, Privacy, and Private Data Handling/1_Working/DEL-12-04_Secret and private-library handling/Procedure.md

### Procedure: DEL-12-04 Secret and private-library handling

#### Purpose

Use this procedure to produce, review, or align DEL-12-04 evidence for private library registry semantics and secret handling tests. The procedure is local-first, source-bound, and limited to the assigned deliverable. June 7 evidence shows metadata-only helper code, public-boundary documentation, and focused tests now exist; this procedure must not treat that evidence as runtime secret storage, cloud behavior, lifecycle acceptance, or approval authority.

#### Prerequisites

- Read `_CONTEXT.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, and `_STATUS.md`.
- Read `INIT.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/CONTRACT.md`, `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` revision 0.7, and the relevant register rows for `DEL-12-04`, `SOW-040`, `SOW-029`, and `OBJ-010`.
- Confirm write scope is limited to this deliverable folder.
- Confirm no real secrets, real private libraries, protected standards text, proprietary values, credential examples, or private project data are needed.
- Treat exact secret provider, encrypted-storage default, storage roots, permission grant persistence, physical project package/container, public API transport, cloud/network behavior, external secret manager behavior, and approval choices as `TBD` unless a later human-approved brief resolves them.
- For readiness-evidence alignment, read `_run_records/TASK_RUN_2026-06-07_0942_secret-private-library-alignment.md`, package fan-in `WORKING_ITEMS_RUN_2026-06-07_0957_TP-PKG12-REDACTION-SECRET-GUARD-CLOSEOUT.md`, `docs/security/secret_private_library_handling.md`, `core/security/secret_private_library/`, and `tests/security/test_secret_private_library_handling.py` as current evidence.

Sources: TASK brief; `_CONTEXT.md`; `docs/DIRECTIVE.md` section 5; `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` section 8.

#### Steps

1. Establish the private asset boundary.
   - Use SOW-029 and SOW-040 to identify protected assets: private rule packs, private material data, private component data, private library references, project models, private paths, and credential references.
   - Verify that no cloud assumption is introduced.

2. Define or verify the registry metadata surface.
   - Record privacy classification, provenance/source summary, redistribution status, review status, checksum status, path reference, credential reference if needed, and default transmission posture.
   - Mark exact schema file placement and storage-provider mechanics as `TBD` unless separately approved.

3. Define or verify secret-reference behavior.
   - Persist only opaque credential references or non-sensitive test markers.
   - Reject or flag artifacts that appear to contain usable credential material.
   - Do not include credential-like examples in docs, fixtures, reports, or run records.

4. Define boundary controls.
   - For import, export, report, bug-report, telemetry, plugin, adapter, and public contribution paths, require explicit privacy/provenance checks.
   - Default to warning, redaction, omission, denied access, quarantine, or human review when classification is missing or suspicious.

5. Define or verify tests.
   - Current focused tests cover metadata completeness, no-secret persistence, redaction/export behavior, telemetry exclusion markers, denied-by-default private/reference release contexts, payload marker blocking, cloud/network marker blocking, external secret-manager marker blocking, direct SQL/raw SQLite marker blocking, storage-bypass marker blocking, concrete path safe metadata reduction, and protected/private-content source boundaries.
   - Use non-sensitive sentinel markers only.

6. Check no-bypass constraints.
   - Confirm adapters/plugins cannot skip schema validation, units, provenance, privacy, protected-content screening, diagnostics, checksums, rule sandboxing, or report controls.

7. Record unresolved human rulings.
   - If provider selection, encryption default, permission grant persistence, or transport behavior is required, record it as `TBD` for a future human-approved implementation brief.

8. Finalize deliverable-local evidence artifacts.
   - Ensure four documents exist and keep default sections.
   - Ensure `_SEMANTIC.md`, `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md`, `Dependencies.csv`, and `_DEPENDENCIES.md` are refreshed.
   - Treat `_STATUS.md` as read-only unless a human-gated lifecycle workflow explicitly authorizes status changes; current `_STATUS.md` records `IN_PROGRESS`.
   - Add phase run records under `_run_records`.

#### Verification

| Check | Pass condition |
|---|---|
| Scope containment | All changed files are inside the DEL-12-04 folder. |
| Four-document sections | Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, and Procedure preserve their default sections. |
| Source boundary | No real secrets, real private libraries, private project data, protected standards content, or usable credential examples are present. |
| Current helper/docs/tests evidence | June 7 run records cite `core/security/secret_private_library/`, `docs/security/secret_private_library_handling.md`, and `tests/security/test_secret_private_library_handling.py`; focused tests passed. |
| Semantic setup evidence | `_SEMANTIC.md` has complete final result tables without matrix errors or operator leakage in final cells. |
| Lensing setup evidence | `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` includes A/B/C/F/D/X/E coverage. |
| Dependency schema | `python3 tools/validation/validate_dependencies_schema.py <ScopePath>/Dependencies.csv` returns valid. |
| Status boundary | `_STATUS.md` is not edited by this procedure; current state is `IN_PROGRESS`, and any lifecycle transition remains human-gated. |

### Specification: DEL-12-04 Secret and private-library handling

#### Scope

This deliverable specifies a local-first handling surface for private libraries, private paths, and credential references used by imports or private storage. It covers the private library registry concept and secret handling tests listed in `_CONTEXT.md`.

In scope:

- local-first handling for private rule packs, private material libraries, private component libraries, owner design-basis files, and project-local private library references;
- registry metadata needed to mark privacy, provenance, redistribution status, checksum status, review status, and transmission posture;
- secret-reference handling for imports or private storage without storing usable secret material in project artifacts, reports, fixtures, or public examples;
- warning, redaction, quarantine, and deny-by-default behavior at export, report, plugin, adapter, telemetry, and public contribution boundaries.
- current metadata-only release-guard evidence in `core/security/secret_private_library/`, `docs/security/secret_private_library_handling.md`, and `tests/security/test_secret_private_library_handling.py`.

Out of scope:

- cloud secret management or cloud storage operations unless separately approved;
- final operating-system credential-store integration details;
- exact secret provider, encrypted-storage default, storage roots, permission grant persistence, physical project package/container, public API transport, cloud/network behavior, external secret manager behavior, and approval choices;
- legal sufficiency, certification, approval, sealing, endorsement, or professional code-compliance claims;
- real private libraries, real credentials, real private project data, protected standards text, protected tables, proprietary formulas, material allowables, SIF/flexibility tables, or protected dimensional data.

#### Standards

No protected standards text, tables, figures, or proprietary values are needed to execute this deliverable. Governing project references are:

- `docs/CONTRACT.md` invariants OPS-K-IP-1/2/3, OPS-K-DATA-1/2/3, OPS-K-AUTH-1/2, OPS-K-PRIV-1/2, OPS-K-RULE-3, and OPS-K-AGENT-1/2/3/4.
- `docs/DIRECTIVE.md` non-negotiable product principles and stop rules.
- `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md` public/private data and quarantine policy.
- `docs/PRD.md` sections 12, 13, 15, 17, and 18.
- `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md` revision 0.7 architecture basis AB-00-01/02/03/04/06/07/08.

#### Verification

| Verification item | Acceptance signal |
|---|---|
| Four-document source boundary | No real credentials, private libraries, protected standards text, proprietary source content, or usable credential examples appear in deliverable artifacts. |
| Registry metadata coverage | Current helper/test fixtures cover privacy classification, provenance, redistribution status, checksum status, credential-reference posture, transmission default, and review/quarantine status as metadata-only records; exact registry schema/storage placement remains `TBD`. |
| Secret-reference safety | Current tests fail when a project or registry artifact contains secret material instead of an opaque reference or non-sensitive sentinel marker. |
| Local-first default | Modeling, solving, rule checking, reporting, and private-library use require no cloud service by default. |
| Redaction/export path | June 7 guard evidence aligns with DEL-12-02 redaction/export markers for metadata-only report/shared/downstream release contexts; runtime report/export route integration remains `TBD`. |
| Permission path | Plugin/adapter access semantics are denied by default in the documented no-bypass control surface; exact permission grant persistence remains `TBD`. |
| Diagnostic path | Missing provenance, unknown redistribution, suspected protected content, payload markers, cloud/network markers, external secret-manager markers, direct SQL/raw SQLite markers, storage-bypass markers, and concrete path indicators produce structured diagnostics or safe metadata reduction in current focused tests. |

#### Documentation

Required deliverable-local artifacts:

- `Datasheet.md`
- `Specification.md`
- `Guidance.md`
- `Procedure.md`
- `_SEMANTIC.md`
- `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md`
- `Dependencies.csv`
- `_DEPENDENCIES.md`
- `_run_records/*` phase records

Current implementation-facing evidence:

- `core/security/secret_private_library/controls.py` and `__init__.py` provide metadata-only reference classification and release-guard helpers;
- `docs/security/secret_private_library_handling.md` documents guard behavior and non-authority boundaries;
- `tests/security/test_secret_private_library_handling.py` provides focused invented-fixture coverage;
- `_run_records/TASK_RUN_2026-06-07_0942_secret-private-library-alignment.md` and package fan-in `WORKING_ITEMS_RUN_2026-06-07_0957_TP-PKG12-REDACTION-SECRET-GUARD-CLOSEOUT.md` record passing focused and paired PKG-12 validation.

Remaining implementation details not resolved by this specification include exact secret provider, encrypted-storage default, storage roots, permission grant persistence, physical project package/container, public API transport, cloud/network behavior, external secret manager behavior, and approval choices.
