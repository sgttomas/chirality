#### Attributes

| Attribute | Current value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Primary subject | Primitive load definitions and mechanics-boundary preparation for weight, pressure, thermal expansion, imposed displacement, hydrotest, wind, seismic, and occasional categories. | `_CONTEXT.md`; `core/loads/primitive_loads/README.md`; `src/lib.rs` |
| Analysis model boundary | Primitive loads are prepared for a 3D centerline/frame mechanics model through nodal, element-uniform, imposed-displacement, lumped-equivalent nodal, axial-effect, and solver-vector assembly surfaces. | `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-MECH-1; `src/lib.rs` |
| Mechanics/rule boundary | The crate defines mechanics load categories and deterministic findings; it does not evaluate user-rule acceptability, code compliance, professional judgment, code combinations, or allowables. | `docs/CONTRACT.md` OPS-K-MECH-2; `core/loads/primitive_loads/README.md` |
| Unit boundary | Load magnitudes carry explicit dimensions; boundary metadata maps accepted PKG-02 dimension vocabulary including `force_per_length` and rejects retired aliases. No conversion constants are supplied. | OPS-K-UNIT-1; `CanonicalDimension`; `QuantityUnitMetadata` |
| Boundary metadata | `BoundaryRecordRef`, `BoundaryQuantityRecord`, and `PrimitiveLoadCaseRecord` carry schema binding, target/basis refs, JCS payload refs, payload-hash refs, unit metadata, provenance refs, and canonical round-trip key material. | `src/lib.rs` |
| Load-case record boundary | `PrimitiveLoadCaseRecord` binds one primitive category to canonical model `LoadCase` metadata, sorted load IDs, provenance, payload refs, and hash refs. Mixed-category algebra remains downstream DEL-05-02 scope. | `PrimitiveLoadCaseRecord`; `_DEPENDENCIES.md` |
| Diagnostic bridge | `LoadDiagnosticRecord` maps primitive-load validation and load-case assembly findings to code, class, blocking severity, source, affected object, message, remediation, and provenance ref for later result-envelope transport. | `LoadDiagnosticRecord`; `diagnostic_records_from_load_findings`; `diagnostic_records_from_load_case_assembly_findings` |
| Missing values | Missing solve-required load targets, magnitudes, spans, properties, or provenance become explicit findings/errors rather than silent defaults. | OPS-K-DATA-2; `FindingCode`; `BoundaryMetadataError` |
| Dynamic scope | Wind, seismic, and occasional loads are represented only as explicit equivalent mechanics loads; equivalent-static preparation requires caller-supplied basis/provenance refs. Dynamic procedure generation, response spectra, code coefficients, and environmental defaults remain `TBD` and out of this deliverable. | `_CONTEXT.md`; `README.md`; tests in `src/lib.rs` |

#### Primitive Load Category Register

| Category | Implemented mechanics evidence | Preserved boundary / open item |
|---|---|---|
| Weight | Element uniform `ForcePerLength` loads; eligible for lumped equivalent nodal conversion when caller supplies span/connectivity. | Mass-source, gravity-vector, density provenance, and unit-conversion policy remain `TBD`. |
| Pressure | Element pressure or equivalent line-load records; straight-pipe pressure thrust helper computes `p * internal_area` from caller-supplied properties. | Pressure stress formulas, code stress categories, pressure design rules, and property/default sourcing remain outside this deliverable. |
| Thermal | Element temperature-change records; straight-pipe thermal axial helper computes `E * A * alpha * DeltaT` from caller-supplied properties. | Reference temperature, material property provenance, expansion policy, and broader thermal behavior remain bounded to future sealed scopes. |
| Imposed displacement | Support-target imposed displacement records preserve translational displacement or rotational DOF boundary. | Support/restraint implementation and boundary-condition ownership remain interface-dependent. |
| Hydrotest | Element pressure or equivalent line-load category is represented in primitive mechanics preparation. | Hydrotest procedure defaults, test-fluid assumptions, and code requirements are not invented. |
| Wind | Explicit equivalent nodal force or element `ForcePerLength` mechanics loads are accepted. | Wind coefficients, profiles, exposure rules, and code factors are user/rule-supplied `TBD`. |
| Seismic | Explicit equivalent nodal force or element `ForcePerLength` mechanics loads are accepted. | Dynamic treatment, response parameters, seismic code procedure generation, and acceleration-style placeholders remain out of scope. |
| Occasional | Explicit equivalent nodal force/moment or element `ForcePerLength` mechanics loads are accepted. | Event definition and user/rule mapping remain downstream/user-governed. |

#### Implemented Surfaces

| Surface | Current status |
|---|---|
| Primitive category model | Implemented by `PrimitiveLoadCategory` and `PrimitiveLoadCaseKind`. |
| Primitive load records | Implemented by `PrimitiveLoad`, `LoadTarget`, `LoadDirection`, and `LoadQuantity`. |
| Boundary quantity metadata | Implemented by `CanonicalDimension`, `QuantityUnitMetadata`, `BoundaryRecordRef`, and `BoundaryQuantityRecord`. |
| Primitive load-case records | Implemented by `PrimitiveLoadCaseRecord`; validates model `LoadCase` schema binding, non-empty refs, non-empty unique load IDs, and single-category membership. |
| Load preparation | Implemented by `prepare_loads` for nodal, element-uniform, and imposed-displacement contributions with deterministic sorting. |
| Equivalent-static preparation | Implemented by `EquivalentStaticMechanicsBasis` and `prepare_equivalent_static_loads` for wind, seismic, and occasional explicit mechanics loads with caller-supplied basis/provenance refs. |
| Lumped equivalent nodal conversion | Implemented by `prepare_lumped_nodal_loads` for explicit translational/global `ForcePerLength` element loads with caller-supplied spans/connectivity. |
| Axial effects | Implemented by `prepare_straight_pipe_axial_effects` for thermal axial force and pressure thrust from caller-supplied properties. |
| Solver load-vector assembly | Implemented by `assemble_solver_load_vector`; sorts/sums valid nodal contributions and returns findings instead of partial vectors when invalid data exists. |
| Diagnostic bridge | Implemented by diagnostic conversion helpers for primitive-load and load-case assembly findings. |

#### Verification Evidence

| Evidence | Result |
|---|---|
| Historical run records | `MEMORY.md` records successful cargo formatting/testing tranches for primitive implementation, lumping, solver-vector assembly, axial effects, boundary dimension update, load-case records, and diagnostic bridge. |
| Current crate tests | `src/lib.rs` contains 40 tests for all primitive categories, boundary metadata, retired dimension aliases, equivalent-static handling, load-case records, deterministic sorting, lumping, axial effects, diagnostic records, missing/invalid inputs, and solver-vector assembly findings. |
| Current validation evidence | `cargo test --manifest-path core/loads/primitive_loads/Cargo.toml --locked` passed with 40 tests in the 2026-06-05 foundational hardening tranche; doc-alignment closeout should still run diff hygiene for touched files. |

## Component: execution/PKG-05_Loads, Load Cases, and Stress Recovery/1_Working/DEL-05-01_Primitive load case engine/Guidance.md

### Guidance: DEL-05-01 Primitive load case engine

#### Purpose

This deliverable frames primitive load categories as explicit mechanics inputs for the OpenPipeStress solver boundary. The current implementation evidence is the bounded `core/loads/primitive_loads` crate, which preserves primitive category identity, deterministic findings, boundary metadata, load-case record shape, diagnostic bridge records, equivalent-static mechanics handling, lumped equivalent nodal conversion, and straight-pipe axial-effect helpers without adding code-specific combinations or compliance logic.

#### Principles

- Treat primitive load categories as mechanics-boundary records and validation surfaces, not as a finished load-combination or rule-pack engine.
- Keep primitive category, primitive load, primitive load case, load-case algebra, code combination, and rule-pack evaluation as separate concepts.
- Preserve unit/dimension intent and provenance references for load quantities, boundary records, load-case records, and diagnostic records.
- Use explicit findings/errors for missing targets, magnitudes, spans, properties, provenance, invalid dimensions, invalid directions, invalid topology, and non-finite values.
- Keep wind, seismic, and occasional loads as explicit equivalent mechanics inputs with explicit basis/provenance refs unless a later sealed scope authorizes dynamic methods or lawful procedure generation.
- Avoid copying or deriving protected standard content, tables, examples, coefficients, jurisdictional factors, or proprietary defaults.

#### Considerations

| Topic | Guidance |
|---|---|
| Weight | Use explicit mechanics quantities such as element `ForcePerLength`; any mass-source, gravity-vector, density, and conversion policy must come from lawful upstream data or future sealed scope. |
| Pressure | Pressure can be carried as an element primitive load and interpreted for straight-pipe pressure thrust only with caller-supplied properties; pressure stress formulas and code stress categories belong elsewhere. |
| Thermal | Thermal can be carried as element temperature change and interpreted for straight-pipe axial force only with caller-supplied material/section properties; reference temperature and material provenance remain open policy. |
| Displacement | Imposed displacement is a support-target mechanics input; support/restraint behavior remains an interface with the owning solver/support deliverables. |
| Hydrotest | Hydrotest is represented as a primitive mechanics category; do not imply hydrotest procedure defaults, code requirements, or test-fluid assumptions without sourced input. |
| Wind/seismic/occasional | Current implemented behavior is explicit equivalent nodal force/moment or element `ForcePerLength` where supported; `prepare_equivalent_static_loads` requires `EquivalentStaticMechanicsBasis`, and acceleration/dynamic placeholders are not treated as dynamic procedure support. |
| Load-case records | Use `PrimitiveLoadCaseRecord` as a storage-neutral single-category boundary record. Mixed-category algebra and user-defined combinations remain DEL-05-02. |
| Boundary metadata | Boundary records should carry schema binding, target/basis refs, JCS payload refs, payload-hash refs, unit metadata, and provenance refs; `TBD` is rejected where a concrete boundary ref is required. |
| Diagnostics | Diagnostic bridge records preserve local finding codes and local classes for result-envelope handoff; they do not define a shared diagnostic enum or final application API. |

#### Trade-offs

| Trade-off | Current position |
|---|---|
| Category coverage vs. behavior breadth | Cover all SOW-013 primitive categories, but only implement bounded mechanics preparation and validation behavior evidenced in `core/loads/primitive_loads`. |
| Public defaults vs. user-supplied data | Do not bundle protected, jurisdictional, or catalog values; require explicit lawful/user-supplied inputs and provenance references. |
| Static equivalent inputs vs. dynamic methods | Wind, seismic, and occasional behavior remains equivalent mechanics input in this slice with caller-supplied basis/provenance refs; dynamic procedure generation remains `TBD`. |
| Primitive load case vs. load algebra | The primitive record binds one category and sorted load IDs; mixed cases, load algebra, and combinations belong to DEL-05-02. |
| Diagnostic bridge vs. final envelope | The crate can produce storage-neutral diagnostic records; final result-envelope/API integration remains downstream. |
| Axial helper formulas vs. code stress evaluation | Thermal and pressure axial-effect helpers compute mechanics forces from explicit properties only; they are not pressure stress formulas, code checks, or allowables. |

#### Evidence Use

- Use `core/loads/primitive_loads/README.md` for the current crate boundary statement.
- Use `core/loads/primitive_loads/src/lib.rs` for implemented API names and unit-test evidence.
- Use `MEMORY.md` for historical tranche evidence, preserved boundaries, and remaining TBDs.
- Use `_DEPENDENCIES.md` for the active downstream interface to DEL-05-02.
- Do not promote lifecycle status or claim release/professional acceptance from these documents alone.

#### Examples

No normative numeric load examples, code-specific combinations, coefficient examples, or jurisdictional examples are introduced here. Test values in `src/lib.rs` are invented mechanics fixtures for unit-test coverage only and are not design defaults.

#### Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted sections | Proposed authority (PROPOSAL) | Human ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| None | No source conflict detected between the deliverable-local truth set and current primitive-load crate evidence. | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Component: execution/PKG-05_Loads, Load Cases, and Stress Recovery/1_Working/DEL-05-01_Primitive load case engine/Procedure.md

### Procedure: DEL-05-01 Primitive load case engine

#### Purpose

Describe bounded steps for maintaining and verifying the primitive load case engine evidence without introducing code-specific load combinations, protected standards data, final result-envelope/API behavior, or compliance claims.

#### Prerequisites

- Sealed deliverable scope for DEL-05-01 and SOW-013.
- Applicable architecture basis IDs AB-00-01, AB-00-02, AB-00-03, AB-00-06, and AB-00-08.
- Invariants OPS-K-MECH-1, OPS-K-MECH-2, OPS-K-UNIT-1, OPS-K-SOLVER-1, OPS-K-DATA-1, OPS-K-DATA-2, OPS-K-AGENT-1 through OPS-K-AGENT-4, and OPS-K-IP-1.
- Current implementation evidence in `core/loads/primitive_loads/README.md` and `core/loads/primitive_loads/src/lib.rs`.
- Explicit human approval before any future scope adds code-specific combinations, coefficients, allowables, default environmental factors, dynamic procedure generation, final compliance claims, or professional reliance claims.

#### Steps

1. Confirm the deliverable identity, package, scope item, objective, architecture basis, and current lifecycle state from `_CONTEXT.md` and `_STATUS.md`.
2. Read the deliverable-local truth set before edits: `_CONTEXT.md`, `_STATUS.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, and `Procedure.md`.
3. Read the implementation evidence in `core/loads/primitive_loads/README.md` and `core/loads/primitive_loads/src/lib.rs`.
4. Confirm all SOW-013 primitive categories remain represented: weight, pressure, thermal expansion, imposed displacement, hydrotest, wind, seismic, and occasional.
5. Confirm primitive mechanics boundaries: nodal, element-uniform, imposed-displacement, equivalent-static preparation, lumped equivalent nodal conversion, straight-pipe axial effects, and solver load-vector assembly are documented only to the extent implemented.
6. Preserve the boundary between primitive load definitions/load-case records in DEL-05-01 and mixed-category load-case algebra/user combinations in DEL-05-02.
7. Preserve the boundary between mechanics solving, diagnostic record transport, rule/compliance evaluation, and human professional judgment.
8. Keep unknown coefficients, default magnitudes, conversion constants, dynamic treatment, property/default sourcing, production tolerance policy, final API integration, release thresholds, and professional reliance as `TBD` unless supplied by lawful source material and sealed scope.
9. Run focused validation after documentation or crate-affecting changes: `cargo test --manifest-path core/loads/primitive_loads/Cargo.toml` and `git diff --check` scoped to touched files where possible.
10. Record durable closeout evidence in `MEMORY.md` and `_run_records/TASK_RUN_*.md` without editing `_STATUS.md`, dependency registers, DAG artifacts, schemas, repo-level governance, or core code unless explicitly authorized by a later brief.

#### Verification

| Check | Expected evidence |
|---|---|
| Scope check | Documents reference DEL-05-01, PKG-05, SOW-013, OBJ-003, and the current architecture basis consistently. |
| Category check | All eight primitive load categories appear in implementation-aligned evidence. |
| Boundary check | No code-specific load combinations, allowables, factors, coefficients, default magnitudes, dynamic procedure generators, or certification claims are introduced. |
| Unit/boundary metadata check | Documents preserve explicit unit/dimension/provenance/hash-ref boundaries and do not claim conversion constants. |
| Load-case record check | Documents describe single-category primitive load-case records and keep mixed-category algebra in DEL-05-02. |
| Diagnostic bridge check | Documents describe local diagnostic bridge records without claiming a shared enum or final result-envelope/API implementation. |
| Equivalent-static check | Documents limit wind, seismic, and occasional equivalent-static handling to explicit mechanics loads with caller-supplied basis/provenance refs and no dynamic procedure generation. |
| Lumping check | Documents limit lumping to explicit translational/global `ForcePerLength` element loads with caller-supplied spans/connectivity. |
| Axial-effect check | Documents limit axial effects to thermal and pressure mechanics helpers from caller-supplied properties without code stress/compliance claims. |
| Test check | `cargo test --manifest-path core/loads/primitive_loads/Cargo.toml` passes or any failure is recorded with boundaries. |
| Diff hygiene check | `git diff --check` passes for touched files or any failure is recorded. |
| Status check | `_STATUS.md` remains unchanged unless a later brief explicitly authorizes a lifecycle update. |

### Specification: DEL-05-01 Primitive load case engine

#### Scope

This deliverable specifies the implemented evidence boundary for the primitive load case engine under `core/loads/primitive_loads`.

#### Standards

No external protected standard text is introduced by this deliverable. Governing local standards are the project invariant catalog, architecture basis rows AB-00-01, AB-00-02, AB-00-03, AB-00-06, AB-00-08, and the decomposition/register rows listed in `_CONTEXT.md`.

| REQ-05-01-011 | Unit tests cover lumped nodal splitting, accepted translational directions, unsupported pressure/thermal/dynamic inputs, missing/invalid spans, invalid indices, and unchanged base `prepare_loads` behavior. |
| REQ-05-01-012 | Unit tests cover thermal and pressure axial force preparation, finding fan-in, missing/invalid properties, non-finite magnitude, and overflowing computed force rejection. |

#### Remaining TBDs

- Canonical unit conversion constants and production unit conversion policy.
- Final result-envelope/API integration and application-service command/query surface.
- Production tolerance policy and release thresholds.
- Wind/seismic dynamic treatment, occasional-event mapping, and any future lawful procedure generators.
- Broader material/property sourcing policy, default prohibition enforcement, and human acceptance gates.
- Professional reliance and code-compliance acceptance remain human/project authority decisions, not crate behavior.
