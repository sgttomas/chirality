#### Attributes

| Attribute | Setup value |
|---|---|
| Documentation audience | Solver contributors, rule-pack contributors, reviewers, and maintainers. |
| Guide subject | Developer-facing explanation of solver architecture, rule-pack schema expectations, test discipline, and contribution boundaries. |
| Architecture basis | AB-00-01, AB-00-02, AB-00-06, AB-00-07, AB-00-08 from SOFTWARE_DECOMP revision 0.7. |
| Runtime baseline referenced | Rust core/application services; schema-first command/query/job result envelopes; JSON Schema 2020-12; Cargo/Vitest/Playwright/validation/protected-content gates where applicable. |
| Solver boundary | The guide must present the solver as open mechanics for a 3D centerline/frame model, not as a code-compliance authority. |
| Rule-pack boundary | The guide must present rule packs as user-supplied/private design-basis artifacts with provenance, checksums, and redistribution status. |
| Contribution boundary | Contributors may improve mechanics, schemas, tests, docs, and permissively sourced/invented examples; they must not add protected standards data, private project data, or misleading approval claims. |
| Professional boundary | Software output and agent artifacts are drafts/decision support until accepted by human review; they do not certify, seal, approve, authenticate, or declare engineering compliance. |

#### Conditions

| Condition | Requirement for this deliverable |
|---|---|
| Protected content | Do not copy standards-body text, tables, examples, protected formulas, protected dimensional tables, material allowables, SIF/flexibility tables, or proprietary commercial data. |
| Examples | Any example shown in the future guide must be invented, non-code, and marked as educational only. |
| Missing values | Unknown implementation details, engineering values, tolerances, expression grammar choices, numerical solver choices, and CI thresholds remain `TBD` unless a human-approved source resolves them. |
| Unit handling | Guide requirements must reinforce unit-aware model data, rule expressions, imports, exports, diagnostics, and tests. |
| Diagnostics | Guide requirements must use structured diagnostics and result-envelope language without implying compliance approval. |
| No-bypass baseline | Plugins, adapters, rule-pack tooling, and public APIs cannot bypass units, provenance, diagnostics, sandboxing, report controls, or data-boundary checks. |

#### Construction

The future developer guide should be organized around these content groups:

| Content group | Required coverage |
|---|---|
| Architecture map | Layer responsibilities for GUI/application services/domain core/solver/rules/reports/adapters, with no-bypass constraints. |
| Solver architecture | Centerline/frame model, six degree-of-freedom node model, straight elements, component interfaces, loads, stress recovery, nonlinear support status, deterministic diagnostics, and test obligations. |
| Rule-pack architecture | Schema metadata, required inputs, user-supplied variables, checks, provenance, redistribution status, checksum handling, sandboxing, unit checks, and incomplete-input behavior. |
| Test discipline | Unit tests, schema tests, solver benchmarks, stress recovery regression, nonlinear convergence traces, rule-pack evaluator tests, report reproducibility tests, protected-content/provenance gates, and review evidence. |
| Contribution boundaries | What contributors may add, what must be quarantined, how to label assumptions/TBDs, and when to escalate to human/legal/professional review. |
| Review and acceptance | How developer changes move from draft evidence through review without claiming engineering reliance. |

### Guidance: DEL-11-02 Developer guide for solver and rule packs

#### Purpose

The developer guide should give contributors enough structure to extend OpenPipeStress without weakening its governing boundaries. It should explain how the open solver mechanics, user-supplied rule packs, tests, reports, and adapter boundaries fit together, while making clear that protected standards data and professional approval remain outside the public software authority.

#### Principles

| Principle | Guidance |
|---|---|
| Open mechanics first | Describe the solver as an auditable mechanics engine for global centerline/frame analysis. Avoid wording that makes the solver appear to implement a proprietary code. |
| Code-neutral rule checks | Present rule packs as user-owned design-basis artifacts. Public content may define schemas and evaluator mechanics, not protected rule content. |
| No silent defaults | Contributor-facing docs should remind implementers that missing solve-required or rule-check-required values become explicit diagnostics, not hidden assumptions. |
| Unit discipline | Any developer path touching model data, rule variables, imports, exports, reports, or tests must preserve unit awareness and dimensional checks. |
| Provenance discipline | Material, component, rule, allowable, SIF, flexibility, report, and public data values require source/provenance and redistribution status. |
| Test before reliance | Solver and rule-engine changes need deterministic tests before release use; documentation should state the expected evidence families. |
| Human authority | The guide must not suggest that software, maintainers, or agents certify, seal, approve, authenticate, or declare project-specific engineering compliance. |

#### Considerations

##### Solver Architecture

The guide should explain the solver at a level suitable for contributors:

- domain objects and unit-aware model data;
- six degree-of-freedom node semantics;
- local/global element orientation concepts without protected formulas;
- stiffness assembly and sparse solve boundary at a conceptual level;
- loads, stress recovery, result envelopes, and diagnostics;
- nonlinear support status reporting where applicable;
- interaction with rule packs through mechanical outputs and required-input mappings.

Solver documentation should not include protected code equations or code-specific acceptance categories unless those are supplied by the user in private rule packs.

##### Rule-Pack Architecture

The guide should explain the rule-pack artifact as a data contract, not as bundled standards content. The safe baseline includes identity, version, source notice, redistribution status, checksum, required input declarations, variables, checks, unit metadata, and report notice fields.

The guide should make the evaluator boundary explicit: rule expressions are declarative, sandboxed, unit-aware, deterministic, and unable to execute arbitrary code. Exact expression grammar and implementation library remain `TBD` until a sealed implementation deliverable and human approval resolve them.

##### Test Discipline

The guide should point contributors to evidence categories rather than rely on trust:

- unit/schema tests for domain objects and units;
- deterministic solver benchmarks for frame mechanics and transforms using rights-cleared fixtures;
- stress recovery and load application regression tests;
- nonlinear support convergence and active-state traces;
- rule-pack required-input, unit-mismatch, unsafe-expression, and invented-example tests;
- report reproducibility and checksum tests;
- protected-content and provenance gates for public docs, examples, fixtures, and reports.

##### Contribution Boundaries

Developer documentation should give contributors simple stop rules:

- do not contribute protected standards text, tables, figures, examples, protected code-derived formulas, protected dimensional tables, or proprietary vendor data;
- do not add private project data, owner standards, company rule packs, or private component/material libraries to public examples;
- quarantine and escalate suspected protected content;
- label unknowns as `TBD`;
- label inferences as `ASSUMPTION` and proposals as `PROPOSAL`;
- keep mechanics outputs, user-rule checks, and human professional acceptance separate.

#### Trade-offs

| Trade-off | Preferred direction |
|---|---|
| Helpful examples vs protected-content risk | Use invented non-code examples or public/permissive mechanics examples only. |
| Detailed formulas vs IP boundary | Explain architecture and verification expectations without copying protected standards formulas or tables. |
| Fast contribution vs review discipline | Require provenance, test evidence, and protected-content review before accepting public data or rule-pack examples. |
| Flexible plugins vs no-bypass governance | Allow extension points only when units, provenance, diagnostics, sandboxing, privacy, and report controls remain mandatory. |
| Mechanics solve vs rule check | Let the solver compute open mechanics; keep acceptability logic in user/private rule packs. |

#### Examples

Safe example themes for the future guide:

- a non-code invented rule-pack field map that uses placeholder names and no engineering values;
- a mechanics-only test fixture described as an original/public-domain frame case, with expected values held in validation evidence rather than copied from standards;
- a contributor checklist for adding a solver feature without changing rule-pack semantics;
- a quarantine example that shows process fields and decisions without reproducing suspected protected content.

Unsafe example themes:

- copied standards text, tables, clause examples, or formulas;
- material allowable tables or dimensional tables copied from standards;
- private company rule packs, owner standards, project models, or commercial software benchmark files;
- report snippets that imply official compliance, certification, approval, or professional sealing by the software.

#### Open Decisions

| Decision | Status |
|---|---|
| Exact solver numerical library | `TBD` |
| Rule expression grammar/library | `TBD` |
| Exact dependency versions | `TBD` |
| CI provider, coverage thresholds, and performance thresholds | `TBD` |
| Physical project package/container | `TBD` |
| License and contributor certification mechanism | `TBD` until human project authority records it |

#### Conflict Table (for human ruling)

No source conflicts were identified during setup. If later guide drafting discovers conflict between architecture basis, implementation practice, legal/data-boundary policy, or validation requirements, record it here rather than silently resolving it.

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted sections | Proposed authority (PROPOSAL) | Human ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TBD | None recorded. | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |

### Procedure: DEL-11-02 Developer guide for solver and rule packs

#### Purpose

This procedure defines how a future authorized session should produce or refresh the developer guide artifact for solver and rule-pack contributors while preserving OpenPipeStress architecture, IP, data, unit, test, and professional-responsibility boundaries.

#### Prerequisites

| Prerequisite | Source or status |
|---|---|
| Sealed DEL-11-02 brief and explicit write scope | Required before editing the final guide artifact. |
| Current decomposition and registers | `execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md`, `docs/_Registers/Deliverables.csv`, `docs/_Registers/ScopeLedger.csv`. |
| Governing invariants | `docs/CONTRACT.md`, especially IP, data, unit, rule-pack, privacy, authority, and agent invariants. |
| Architecture basis | AB-00-01, AB-00-02, AB-00-06, AB-00-07, AB-00-08. |
| Source references | `INIT.md`, `docs/DIRECTIVE.md`, `docs/TYPES.md`, `docs/SPEC.md`, `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md`, `docs/VALIDATION_STRATEGY.md`, and workflow docs. |
| Human authority for unresolved decisions | Required for license/contributor certification, solver numerical library, rule expression grammar, dependency versions, CI thresholds, and other `TBD` decisions. |

#### Steps

1. Confirm the active write scope.
   - For this setup session, do not edit `docs/developer_guide/index.md`.
   - For a future guide-authoring session, verify the human explicitly authorizes that path.

2. Build the guide outline from the required content groups.
   - Architecture map.
   - Solver architecture.
   - Rule-pack architecture.
   - Test discipline.
   - Contribution boundaries.
   - Review and acceptance.

3. Source every non-trivial requirement from local governing material.
   - Prefer `docs/SPEC.md` for technical architecture and baseline mechanics.
   - Prefer `docs/CONTRACT.md` and `docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md` for boundary constraints.
   - Prefer `docs/VALIDATION_STRATEGY.md` for test families and release gates.
   - Prefer SOFTWARE_DECOMP revision 0.7 for scope, objectives, and architecture basis.

4. Draft solver sections conservatively.
   - Explain centerline/frame mechanics, six degree-of-freedom nodes, loads, stress recovery, diagnostics, and test hooks.
   - Do not copy protected standards formulas, protected examples, code tables, or proprietary commercial examples.
   - Keep exact tolerances, solver numerical library, and performance thresholds as `TBD` unless resolved by approved source.

5. Draft rule-pack sections conservatively.
   - Explain schema shape, required inputs, variables, checks, provenance, redistribution status, checksums, report notices, and missing-input behavior.
   - Explain sandboxing and unit-aware deterministic evaluation.
   - Do not provide protected code equations, allowables, SIF/flexibility factors, protected tables, or private rule-pack content.

6. Draft test-discipline sections.
   - Map solver and rule-pack changes to deterministic evidence families.
   - Include protected-content and provenance gates for public examples, fixtures, docs, reports, and templates.
   - Distinguish mechanics verification from validation and professional reliance.

7. Draft contribution-boundary sections.
   - Define permitted public contributions and prohibited public content.
   - Include quarantine/escalation steps for suspected protected or private data.
   - Require `TBD`, `ASSUMPTION`, and `PROPOSAL` labels where warranted.

8. Run local review checks before proposing the guide for review.
   - Check scope and anticipated artifact path.
   - Scan for protected-content risk and certification/compliance overclaims.
   - Confirm unit/provenance/test/professional boundaries are visible.
   - Confirm unresolved implementation choices remain `TBD`.

9. Record evidence.
   - Keep setup and drafting evidence in the deliverable folder.
   - Record validation commands and results.
   - Do not move anything to `ISSUED` without human review.

#### Verification

| Check | Expected result |
|---|---|
| Four-document kit exists | `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, and `Procedure.md` are present. |
| Scope check | Documentation-only setup; no source code, examples, repo-level docs, or final guide artifact edited in this session. |
| Boundary check | No protected standards text/tables/examples/formulas/proprietary data; no professional approval claims. |
| Coverage check | Solver architecture, rule-pack schema, test discipline, and contribution boundaries are all addressed. |
| TBD check | Unresolved implementation choices are marked `TBD`. |
| Dependency check | `Dependencies.csv` is v3.1 schema-valid and `_DEPENDENCIES.md` counts match. |
| Semantic setup | `_SEMANTIC.md` and `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` exist and are lens-only evidence. |

#### Records

Maintain these records in this deliverable folder:

- four-document setup kit;
- semantic matrix file and lensing register;
- dependency register and dependency index;
- `_STATUS.md` lifecycle history;
- `_run_records/*` for the five required setup invocations;
- validation command results in the final TASK response.


## Component: execution/PKG-11_Documentation, Examples, and Education/1_Working/DEL-11-02_Developer guide for solver and rule packs/Specification.md

### Specification: DEL-11-02 Developer guide for solver and rule packs

#### Scope

This deliverable defines setup evidence for a future developer guide covering solver architecture, rule-pack schema expectations, test discipline, and contribution boundaries for OpenPipeStress.

This setup pass does not edit `docs/developer_guide/index.md`, create examples, implement source code, define protected code rules, select a solver numerical library, select a rule expression grammar, update repository-level documentation, or move artifacts to `ISSUED`.

The guide is documentation for contributors. It must help developers inspect and extend the open mechanics and rule-pack infrastructure while preserving the boundary between public mechanics and user-supplied/protected code data.
