#### Construction

This deliverable now has repository-level schema implementation evidence. This reconciliation records the implemented artifacts without changing schemas, fixtures, tests, lifecycle files, dependency files, or review dispositions.

| Part | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `schemas/section.schema.yaml` | Implemented evidence | Defines a strict pipe/section library schema with `schema_version`, `section_library`, `section_records`, `dimension_definitions`, `property_definitions`, `completeness_rules`, `diagnostics`, and `open_decisions`; it includes unit-bearing section dimension/property slots, provenance, redistribution status, review status, completeness findings, diagnostics, and open decisions. |
| `schemas/component.schema.yaml` | Implemented evidence | Defines a strict component library schema with `schema_version`, `component_library`, `component_family_contracts`, `component_records`, `field_definitions`, `completeness_rules`, `diagnostics`, and `open_decisions`; it includes component-family contracts, user-entered field slots, protected-value policies, provenance, redistribution status, review status, completeness findings, diagnostics, and open decisions. |
| Strict section fixture | Implemented evidence | `fixtures/component/invented_section_library_valid.json` validates as schema-shape evidence and intentionally omits engineering values through `missing` value statuses, incomplete completeness findings, and diagnostics. |
| Strict component fixture | Implemented evidence | `fixtures/component/invented_component_library_valid.json` validates as schema-shape evidence for bend, branch, rigid, and expansion-joint component records while keeping engineering values absent or private/user-supplied only. |
| Combined legacy fixture | Implemented pointer evidence | `fixtures/component/invented_section_component_library_valid.json` carries section/component content plus references to the strict split fixtures; strict validation relies on the split fixtures. |
| Test coverage | Implemented evidence | `tests/test_component_section_schema.py` checks strict schema shape, provenance requirements, redistribution statuses, unit-dimension alignment with PKG-02, component enum equality with the canonical model enum, split fixture validation, and forbidden public-data text. |
| Provenance metadata | Implemented schema mechanism; policy TBDs remain | Schemas require source/provenance, license, contributor certification, redistribution status, and review status. Accepted public source catalogs, source-license disposition, redistribution acceptance, and public contribution approval remain human/policy decisions. |
| Unit-bearing value model | Implemented schema mechanism | Schemas define quantity-value slots with magnitude, unit, dimension, value status, and provenance; tests assert accepted dimension vocabulary alignment with `schemas/units.schema.yaml`. |
| Protected-content gate hooks | Implemented schema/test guardrails; workflow policy TBDs remain | Schemas and fixtures represent protected-suspected/rejected states, protected-value policies, diagnostics, and no-public-value policies. Human review workflow and accepted source policy remain unresolved. |
| Engineering values | Out of scope | No pipe dimensional table values, component catalog values, allowables, SIFs, flexibility factors, or code-derived values are introduced here. |

### Guidance: Pipe Section and Component Library Schema

#### Purpose

This guidance explains how to use and extend the implemented DEL-03-02 schema evidence. The deliverable enables private pipe section and component libraries while preserving provenance, redistribution status, review status, unit safety, completeness findings, diagnostics, and the public/private data boundary.

#### Principles

- Treat the schema as a carrier for user/private or lawfully redistributable library records, not as a source of public engineering tables.
- Keep protected dimensional tables, protected standards content, proprietary catalog values, allowables, SIFs, flexibility factors, and code-derived values out of public defaults.
- Make missing values visible as validation findings, completeness flags, or diagnostics; do not fill them silently.
- Require provenance and redistribution status wherever a value could affect engineering reliance or public contribution review.
- Keep dimensional and mass-property values unit-aware.
- Separate detailed component-family mechanics from the generic library schema unless a sealed adjacent DEL-03 deliverable authorizes specialization.

#### Considerations

- This reconciliation records implemented evidence in `schemas/component.schema.yaml`, `schemas/section.schema.yaml`, the strict split fixtures, the combined legacy fixture pointer, and `tests/test_component_section_schema.py`; it does not edit those repository-level artifacts.
- SOW-018 is narrower than several adjacent PKG-03 deliverables. The component schema includes generic bend, branch, rigid, and expansion-joint family contracts and slots, but detailed mechanics, accepted values, and editor behavior remain outside this reconciliation scope.
- Provenance and redistribution schema mechanisms distinguish private, public-permissive, unknown-source, protected-suspected, rejected, pending, accepted, and quarantined states. Accepted public source catalogs, source/license disposition, redistribution acceptance, and public fixture value policy remain `TBD`.
- Public example data must be invented, original, public-domain, or otherwise supported by documented redistribution rights.
- If any implementation needs a protected source table to define defaults, stop and route the value to user-supplied/private data handling instead.

#### Trade-offs

| Topic | Conservative position |
|---|---|
| Exact field names | Implemented schema field names are evidence; changes require a sealed schema review. |
| Component-family depth | Keep generic family contracts and schema slots here; defer detailed mechanics and accepted engineering values to their owning DEL-03 deliverables. |
| Default dimensional values | Do not provide. Public defaults risk protected-table or proprietary-data leakage. |
| Provenance strictness | Prefer explicit `unknown`, `protected_suspected`, `quarantined`, or `TBD` over weak inferred source claims. |
| Public contribution acceptance | Requires documented rights and review; schema can support the metadata but does not itself approve contribution. |

#### Examples

- Safe example approach: use invented pipe section/component records in tests with engineering values omitted or clearly non-engineering, plus explicit provenance/review status.
- Unsafe example approach: copying nominal pipe dimensions, vendor catalog weights, protected code tables, or proprietary component geometry into public fixtures.

#### Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A | Source B | Impacted sections | Proposed authority (PROPOSAL) | Human ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEL-03-02-CF-001 | `_CONTEXT.md` identifies SOFTWARE_DECOMP revision 0.7, while `_REFERENCES.md` still describes the decomposition reference as accepted v0.2. | `_CONTEXT.md#Decomposition Reference` | `_REFERENCES.md#Decomposition and Registers` | Datasheet References; Procedure Records | Treat `_CONTEXT.md` and sealed brief revision 0.7 as current basis for this run; route `_REFERENCES.md` cleanup to a metadata owner because it is outside the four-doc write target. | RESOLVED_BY_HUMAN: current `_CONTEXT.md` and `_REFERENCES.md` both cite SOFTWARE_DECOMP revision 0.7; prior v0.2 reference is stale/superseded. |

### Procedure: Pipe Section and Component Library Schema

#### Purpose

This procedure describes how to maintain and reconcile DEL-03-02 schema evidence without introducing protected tables, proprietary catalog data, invented engineering values, or unsupported compliance claims.

#### Prerequisites

- Sealed DEL-03-02 context with write scope limited to the current authorized files.
- Register rows for DEL-03-02, SOW-018, and ContextBudgetQA row DEL-03-02.
- Applicable contract invariants from `docs/CONTRACT.md`, especially IP, provenance, unit safety, privacy, governance review, and agent epistemic constraints.
- Architecture basis AB-00-01, AB-00-02, AB-00-04, AB-00-06, AB-00-07, and AB-00-08.
- Implemented evidence in `schemas/section.schema.yaml`, `schemas/component.schema.yaml`, `fixtures/component/invented_section_library_valid.json`, `fixtures/component/invented_component_library_valid.json`, `fixtures/component/invented_section_component_library_valid.json`, and `tests/test_component_section_schema.py`.
- Human-owned dependency declarations are not tracked in `_DEPENDENCIES.md`; no explicit upstream/downstream list is available.

#### Steps

1. Confirm identity and boundary.
   - Verify deliverable ID `DEL-03-02`, package `PKG-03`, type `DATA_MODEL_CHANGE`, scope item `SOW-018`, and objective `OBJ-004`.
   - Confirm whether the active brief allows repository-level schema edits. If not, reconcile documentation evidence only.

2. Gather governing source slices.
   - Read `_CONTEXT.md`, `_REFERENCES.md`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, register rows, decomposition row DEL-03-02, SOW-018, OBJ-004, and applicable contract invariants when they are in scope.
   - Read the implemented evidence files named in the prerequisites.
   - Use only accessible local governance, decomposition, schema, fixture, and test sources for evidence.

3. Reconcile schema intent against implemented evidence.
   - Identify implemented record classes: section library record and component library record.
   - Record implemented concepts: identity, schema version, user-entered dimensions/weights/COG/stiffness/modifier slots where applicable, unit-bearing values, provenance, redistribution status, review status, completeness status, diagnostics hooks, open decisions, and protected-value policies.
   - Preserve human-owned policy/source/catalog/fixture-value/dependency/lifecycle/review-disposition items as `TBD`.

4. Apply data-boundary rules.
   - Reject protected standards text, protected dimensional tables, proprietary catalog data, code-derived values, copied formulas, and private project data as public defaults.
   - Mark suspected protected content for quarantine and human review.

5. Map requirements to verification.
   - For each requirement, identify implemented schema validation, unit check, provenance gate, protected-content gate, split-fixture validation, compatibility regression, round-trip test, or architecture review evidence.
   - Use invented/public-safe fixtures only.

6. Perform consistency review.
   - Confirm Datasheet, Specification, Guidance, and Procedure use consistent terms: section library record, component library record, provenance, redistribution status, unit-aware value, protected-content gate, and private/public data boundary.
   - Convert unsupported details to `TBD`, `ASSUMPTION`, or a Conflict Table entry.

7. Stop and escalate when needed.
   - Stop if implementation would require protected tables, proprietary data, code-derived defaults, legal conclusions about redistribution rights, or professional/certification claims.

#### Verification

- The four active documents exist and retain required sections.
- No repo-level schema files are edited unless the active sealed brief authorizes them.
- No protected dimensional tables, standards data, proprietary catalog values, or invented engineering values are introduced.
- Unknown policy/source/catalog/fixture-value/dependency/lifecycle/review-disposition items remain `TBD`.
- Requirements cite accessible sources or are labeled as assumptions.
- Dependency extraction artifacts and lifecycle state remain unchanged unless explicitly in scope.

#### Records

- `Datasheet.md`, `Specification.md`, `Guidance.md`, and `Procedure.md` record active deliverable evidence.
- `_SEMANTIC.md` records the semantic lens generated for this deliverable.
- `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` records warranted enrichment items.
- `Dependencies.csv` and `_DEPENDENCIES.md` record extracted dependency evidence.
- `_run_records/TASK_RUN_*.md` records the required sequence, QA checks, missing inputs, and human rulings needed.

### Specification: Pipe Section and Component Library Schema

#### Scope

DEL-03-02 defines the pipe section and component library schema artifacts listed in the decomposition: `schemas/section.schema.yaml` and `schemas/component.schema.yaml`. The schema subject is private library records for user-entered dimensions, weights, centers of gravity, stiffness/modifier slots, source/license metadata, provenance, redistribution status, review status, completeness findings, diagnostics, and open decisions.

The repository-level schema files, strict split fixtures, legacy combined fixture pointer, and focused schema tests are implemented evidence for this deliverable. This reconciliation does not edit those repository-level artifacts, does not add public pipe dimensional tables, does not add component catalog values, and does not resolve human-owned policy decisions for public source catalogs, fixture values, redistribution acceptance, dependency satisfaction, lifecycle, or review disposition.

#### Verification

| Requirement IDs | Verification approach |
|---|---|
| REQ-01, REQ-02, REQ-13 | Review implemented schema files for section/component record coverage and traceability to DEL-03-02. |
| REQ-03, REQ-07 | Protected-content review confirms no protected tables, code-derived values, proprietary catalog defaults, or private data are present in public artifacts. |
| REQ-04 | Schema and validation tests confirm missing required values become validation findings, not defaults. |
| REQ-05 | Provenance/redistribution tests confirm required source and status fields exist and are not silently omitted. |

#### Documentation

Implemented artifacts and open items:

- `schemas/section.schema.yaml` implements schema versioning, unit-bearing section dimension/property fields, provenance/redistribution metadata, review status, completeness status, diagnostics, and open decisions.
- `schemas/component.schema.yaml` implements schema versioning, component-library record identity, component-family contracts, user-entered dimensions/weights/COG/stiffness/modifier slots, provenance/redistribution metadata, review status, completeness status, diagnostics, and open decisions.
- `fixtures/component/invented_section_library_valid.json` and `fixtures/component/invented_component_library_valid.json` are strict invented/public-safe fixtures with engineering values intentionally omitted.
- `fixtures/component/invented_section_component_library_valid.json` remains legacy combined evidence and points to the strict split fixtures.
- `tests/test_component_section_schema.py` is the focused verification surface for schema/fixture compatibility.
- Public source catalogs, public fixture value policy, source/license disposition, redistribution acceptance, dependency satisfaction, human review disposition, lifecycle state, and persistence round-trip notes remain `TBD` or governed outside this reconciliation scope.
