## Component: execution/PKG-01_Governance, IP Boundary, and Professional Responsibility/1_Working/DEL-01-04_Professional responsibility and product-claims policy/Guidance.md

### Guidance: DEL-01-04 Professional responsibility and product-claims policy

#### Purpose

This guidance explains how to draft professional-boundary and product-claims language for OpenPipeStress without overstating what software, agents, rule packs, reports, or releases can warrant.

The central boundary is: OpenPipeStress may assist analysis, expose evidence, compute mechanics, evaluate user-defined rule packs, and produce auditable reports; it does not replace competent professional judgment.

#### Principles

| Principle | Guidance |
|---|---|
| Use precise authority language | Say what the software computes or records. Do not say it certifies, seals, approves, authenticates, or declares professional/code compliance for reliance. |
| Separate statuses | Keep `MECHANICS_SOLVED`, `USER_RULE_CHECKED`, `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED`, and `HUMAN_APPROVED_FOR_PROJECT` distinct. |
| Preserve human decision rights | A human project authority may accept a development artifact; a competent engineering professional may accept a project calculation. These are different gates. |
| Make missing data visible | Missing code data, provenance, assumptions, and warnings are findings, not silent defaults. |
| Keep public examples safe | Public notices and examples use original, invented, or permissively sourced content only. |
| Keep design-engine claims bounded | The current product scope may describe a design engine and stress-model authoring environment, but that language cannot imply professional approval or code compliance. |

#### Considerations

- Product language should prefer "decision support", "mechanics result", "rule-pack result", "diagnostic", "warning", "provenance", and "human review required" over conclusory compliance language.
- Report notices should be attached to the report output and not hidden only in documentation.
- A release maturity claim can describe validation evidence and limitations, but it cannot imply approval for a specific piping design.
- Legal or jurisdiction-specific professional-practice wording is `TBD` until a qualified human authority provides it.
- Draft repo-level notice wording exists in `docs/report_notice_template.md`; final acceptance, jurisdiction-specific wording, and release-policy language remain human-gated.

#### Trade-offs

| Trade-off | Preferred Resolution |
|---|---|
| Clear marketing language vs. professional boundary precision | Prefer precision. Ambiguous claims create unacceptable reliance risk. |
| Automated report convenience vs. human review | Reports may assemble evidence, but reliance remains a human decision. |
| User-rule pass/fail vs. code compliance | Treat user-rule pass/fail as a computational result using user-supplied inputs, not a professional compliance declaration. |
| Draft agent output vs. accepted governance | Treat agent output as draft/proposal until human acceptance. |
| Draft repo-level policy vs. accepted governance | Treat `docs/PROFESSIONAL_BOUNDARY.md` and `docs/report_notice_template.md` as draft evidence until a human gate accepts or revises them. |

#### Examples

| Safer Draft Claim | Avoid |
|---|---|
| "The report includes mechanical results, user-rule check results, warnings, assumptions, provenance notes, and limitations for competent human review." | "The report certifies code compliance." |
| "The rule pack evaluated user-defined checks using the recorded inputs." | "The software approved the design." |
| "A competent human must review the model, data, rule basis, warnings, and report before professional reliance." | "No further engineering review is required." |

#### Conflict Table (for human ruling)

| Conflict ID | Conflict | Source A (file + section) | Source B (file + section) | Impacted sections | Proposed authority (PROPOSAL) | Human ruling (TBD) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| None | No source conflict identified in accessible setup materials. | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |

## Component: execution/PKG-01_Governance, IP Boundary, and Professional Responsibility/1_Working/DEL-01-04_Professional responsibility and product-claims policy/Procedure.md

### Procedure: DEL-01-04 Professional responsibility and product-claims policy

#### Purpose

Define the local procedure for producing and checking professional-boundary policy language and report notice text for OpenPipeStress.

#### Prerequisites

- Sealed deliverable context for DEL-01-04.
- Applicable sources: docs/DIRECTIVE.md, docs/CONTRACT.md, docs/TYPES.md, docs/SPEC.md, docs/IP_AND_DATA_BOUNDARY.md, execution/_Decomposition/SOFTWARE_DECOMP.md revision 0.7, approved DAG-006 context, and register rows for DEL-01-04, SOW-034, and SOW-064.
- No protected standards/code text or proprietary engineering data in the drafting input.
- Human/legal/professional rulings available for jurisdiction-specific language: `TBD`.

#### Steps

1. Confirm the target artifact is policy/report-notice language, not solver, GUI, schema, or report-generator implementation.
2. Extract the required professional boundary from SOW-034 and OPS-K-AUTH-1.
3. Extract related report, governance, and agent boundaries from OPS-K-REPORT-1, OPS-K-REPORT-2, OPS-K-GOV-3, OPS-K-AGENT-1 through OPS-K-AGENT-4, and OPS-K-MECH-2.
4. Extract the SOW-064 design-engine/product-scope boundary and keep it subordinate to the non-authoritative professional reliance boundary.
5. Draft permitted-claim language that describes only supported behavior: mechanics computation, user-rule evaluation, warnings, provenance, assumptions, limitations, design-authoring support, and human-review support.
6. Draft prohibited-claim language that excludes certification, sealing, approval, authentication, official endorsement, and compliance-for-reliance claims by software or agents.
7. Review `docs/report_notice_template.md` for notice language that states code-specific data is user-supplied and professional reliance requires competent human review.
8. Mark legal conclusions, jurisdiction-specific obligations, unresolved acceptance workflow details, and final acceptance of notice wording as `TBD`.
9. Check drafts against protected-content boundaries before publication or release use.
10. Route any repo-level policy/report-notice revision or issuance decision to human review before any `ISSUED` lifecycle state or project-policy acceptance claim.
11. If human acceptance records are introduced, bind each record to the relevant model, rule-pack, and report hashes and require re-review after content changes.

#### Verification

| Check | Action |
|---|---|
| Scope check | Confirm edits are limited to the authorized deliverable or later authorized repo-level target. |
| Prohibited-claim check | Confirm no affirmative certification, sealing, approval, authentication, endorsement, or compliance-for-reliance claim remains. |
| Status check | Confirm mechanics, user-rule, missing-data, and human-approval states remain distinct. |
| Provenance check | Confirm report notice language requires source/provenance disclosure where engineering reliance may be affected. |
| Publication-readiness screen | Confirm exact notice wording, protected-content checks, and human acceptance status before repo-level publication. |
| Human-gate check | Confirm draft/proposal status remains visible until human acceptance. |

| DEL-01-04-R02 | Policy language shall distinguish mechanics solve, user-rule-pack check, and competent human professional approval. | OPS-K-MECH-2; TYPES.md Analysis-status vocabulary | Cross-check terms against `MECHANICS_SOLVED`, `USER_RULE_CHECKED`, `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED`, and `HUMAN_APPROVED_FOR_PROJECT`. |
| DEL-01-04-R03 | Report notice language shall say that code-specific data is user-supplied and that professional reliance requires competent human review. | SPEC.md Section 8; OPS-K-REPORT-1 | Report-template checklist includes both notices. |
| DEL-01-04-R04 | Product and release claims shall disclose scope, validation status, known limitations, data-boundary constraints, and professional-responsibility limitations. | OPS-K-GOV-3 | Release/review checklist references these disclosure categories. |
| DEL-01-04-R05 | Human acceptance records, if implemented, shall bind to specific model, rule-pack, and report hashes and require re-review after content changes. | OPS-K-AUTH-2 | Acceptance-record schema or procedure includes hash binding and invalidation rule. |
| DEL-01-04-R06 | Draft and generated outputs shall remain proposals until accepted by a human gate. | OPS-K-AGENT-4; AGENTIC_DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md | Lifecycle/status language avoids issued/accepted claims unless human approval exists. |
| DEL-01-04-R07 | Unknown policy choices, legal interpretations, or jurisdiction-specific professional obligations shall be marked `TBD` and escalated for human/legal/professional review. | OPS-K-AGENT-1; DIRECTIVE.md stop rules | Review confirms no legal conclusion is stated as fact. |
| DEL-01-04-R08 | Public notices and examples shall not reproduce protected standards content or proprietary engineering data. | OPS-K-IP-1; OPS-K-REPORT-2 | Protected-content review gate. |
| DEL-01-04-R09 | Repo-level professional-boundary and report-notice text shall remain draft until a human review gate accepts it; local evidence must not present draft text as issued policy. | _CONTEXT.md write-scope limit; OPS-K-AGENT-4 | Review confirms this local kit does not present repo-level text as issued policy. |
