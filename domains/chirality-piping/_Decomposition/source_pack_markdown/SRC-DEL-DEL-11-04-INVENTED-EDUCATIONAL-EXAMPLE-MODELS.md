| Context envelope | M |
| Current production mode | Setup/document production only |

#### Attributes

| Attribute | Source-grounded value |
|---|---|
| Primary purpose | Define the setup boundary for future invented-data educational examples used for mechanics-only demonstrations and fake-rule-pack demonstrations. |
| Public-data posture | Future public examples must be original or invented and must not reproduce protected standards text, tables, formulas, examples, allowables, SIF or flexibility data, protected dimensional tables, commercial-software examples, or vendor proprietary data. |
| Example families | Mechanics-only demonstration examples; fake-rule-pack demonstration examples. |
| Materialization status | This setup run does not create actual example model files under `examples/models/invented/*`, tutorials outside this deliverable, source code, schemas, or issued artifacts. |
| Rule-pack boundary | Fake rule-pack examples are fictional non-code teaching devices and must not resemble or approximate real code allowables, formulas, load combinations, or acceptance rules. |
| Mechanics boundary | Mechanics-only examples may illustrate open centerline mechanics concepts and reproducibility expectations, but they must not be presented as design bases or compliance checks. |
| Unit/provenance expectation | Future example data must be unit-aware and must carry provenance such as `PUBLIC_DOMAIN_OR_ORIGINAL` or a stronger documented redistribution basis. |
| Professional boundary | Example outputs are educational and test-support artifacts only; professional reliance requires competent human review outside the software. |

#### Conditions

| Condition | Handling |
|---|---|
| A future example needs code-specific data | Leave the value `TBD` or require user/private input; do not invent a realistic code value. |
| A future example would benefit from a real standard example | Stop and route to human/legal review; do not copy or paraphrase protected examples into public artifacts. |
| A fake rule pack needs pass/fail behavior | Use clearly fictional labels and non-engineering placeholder values; avoid code-style formulas and realistic allowables. |
| A mechanics-only example needs numeric quantities | Use original toy quantities with unit labels and provenance; document that they are not engineering recommendations. |
| A tutorial wants to compare against commercial software | Exclude the comparison from public examples unless a separate lawful and approved basis exists. |
| A future example is used in validation or regression | Record the distinction between mechanics verification and code compliance; do not imply professional approval. |

#### Construction

This setup artifact defines constraints, acceptance checks, and dependency signals for future invented educational examples. It intentionally does not create external example model files, tutorials outside this deliverable, code, schemas, private data, or `ISSUED` artifacts.

Future example artifacts should include:

- a clear non-engineering notice;
- a source/provenance field for every invented data set;
- a mechanics-only or fake-rule-pack classification;
- a unit basis for every quantity;
- a protected-content review record before public use;
- a statement that user rule checks and professional approval remain separate from mechanics solve results.

### Guidance: DEL-11-04 Invented educational example models

#### Purpose

Invented educational examples let future users and contributors inspect OpenPipeStress mechanics and rule-pack workflow boundaries without importing protected standards data or implying engineering reliance.

#### Principles

1. Public examples are invented, original, and clearly non-code.
2. Mechanics-only examples demonstrate solver workflow and reproducibility, not code acceptance.
3. Fake-rule-pack examples demonstrate missing-data and rule-check plumbing, not real design rules.
4. Every future example must carry unit and provenance information.
5. Missing or unresolved data remains visible as `TBD` or a finding.
6. Software examples never certify, approve, seal, or declare professional code compliance.

#### Considerations

Mechanics-only examples should remain simple enough to audit while still showing the intended data flow: model identity, units, nodes/elements or comparable centerline entities, supports, load cases, diagnostics, results, and reproducibility metadata. Any future numeric values should be toy values created for demonstration and should not be copied from standards, vendor catalogues, owner specifications, or commercial software examples.

Fake-rule-pack demonstrations should show that user-rule checks are separate from mechanics solves. They can use fictional rule names, fictional required inputs, fake threshold labels, and placeholder outcomes. They must not teach or approximate real code formulas, material allowables, stress categories, SIF/flexibility factors, or load-combination rules.

Testing use must be described carefully. A public invented example can support regression or verification of software behavior, but it is not evidence that any real piping system is safe, compliant, or professionally approved.

#### Trade-offs

| Trade-off | Guidance |
|---|---|
| Educational clarity vs. realism | Prefer auditability and boundary clarity over realistic engineering values. |
| Reusable fixture vs. hidden default | Make invented provenance explicit and keep unresolved data visible. |
| Mechanics demonstration vs. rule-check demonstration | Keep mechanics-only examples separate from fake-rule-pack examples so result status is not confused. |
| Public convenience vs. IP protection | Do not include protected examples or commercial software comparisons for convenience. |
| Validation support vs. compliance implication | Use examples for software behavior checks only; keep professional reliance outside software authority. |

#### Example Concepts

Future work may define non-file concepts such as:

- a mechanics-only centerline model that demonstrates unit-aware loads and deterministic result review;
- a support/diagnostic model that demonstrates visible missing or invalid inputs;
- a fake-rule-pack demonstration that shows required fictional inputs, checksum metadata, and blocked rule-check status when those inputs are absent;
- a tutorial path that explains how to inspect provenance and limitations before running a demonstration.

These concepts are not actual model files in this setup session. They are constraints for future artifacts.

#### Non-Reliance Notice

Any future example produced from this setup must say, in substance, that it is invented for education/testing, is not a design basis, is not a standards example, and does not certify or approve engineering work.

## Component: execution/PKG-11_Documentation, Examples, and Education/1_Working/DEL-11-04_Invented educational example models/Procedure.md

### Procedure: DEL-11-04 Invented educational example models

#### Purpose

Define the setup-time procedure and future production checks for invented educational examples without creating external example files, tutorials, source code, schemas, protected data, or issued artifacts in this session.

#### Prerequisites

| Prerequisite | Status for setup | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Sealed DEL-11-04 context | Available | `_CONTEXT.md` identifies SOW-033, OBJ-001, and OBJ-008. |
| Governing data/IP and professional boundary | Available | `INIT.md`, `docs/CONTRACT.md`, `docs/DIRECTIVE.md`, and `docs/TYPES.md`. |
| Future model schema and persistence format | Future dependency | DEL-02-01 and DEL-02-05 are needed before actual public model files are materialized. |
| Future rule-pack schema and invented fake rule-pack pattern | Future dependency | DEL-06-01 and DEL-06-05 are needed before fake-rule-pack demonstration files are materialized. |
| Future validation fixture expectations | Future dependency | PKG-09 validation work determines when examples can become regression or validation fixtures. |

#### Steps

1. Confirm the deliverable identity and scope match `DEL-11-04`, `PKG-11`, and SOW-033.
2. Preserve the protected-data boundary by excluding standards text, protected examples, code formulas, allowables, SIF/flexibility data, proprietary vendor data, commercial software examples, and private project data.
3. Classify future examples into mechanics-only invented demonstrations and fake-rule-pack demonstrations.
4. Require future example artifacts to carry a non-reliance notice, provenance fields, unit labels, and explicit `TBD` markers for unresolved inputs.
5. Keep mechanics solve examples separate from fake rule-check examples so users can see that mechanics solved, user-rule checked, and professionally approved are different states.
6. Record dependencies on schema, rule-pack, protected-content review, and validation deliverables in `Dependencies.csv`.
7. During this setup run, write only deliverable-local documentation, semantic artifacts, dependency artifacts, run records, and status history.
8. Leave external example model files, external tutorials, source code, schemas, and `ISSUED` movement untouched.

#### Verification

For this setup run, verify:

- the four-document kit exists;
- `_SEMANTIC.md` and `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` exist and remain semantic aids rather than engineering authority;
- `Dependencies.csv` validates against the v3.1 schema;
- `_DEPENDENCIES.md` counts match the CSV;
- `_STATUS.md` reaches `SEMANTIC_READY` only after the setup sequence passes;
- no external example files, tutorials outside this deliverable, source code, schemas, repo-level artifacts, or `ISSUED` files were created;
- no protected standards examples, commercial software examples, realistic code allowables/formulas, or professional-reliance claims appear in the deliverable-local outputs.

#### Records

The setup records are the four-document kit, `_SEMANTIC.md`, `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md`, `Dependencies.csv`, `_DEPENDENCIES.md`, `_STATUS.md`, and `_run_records/*` in this DEL-11-04 folder.

### Specification: DEL-11-04 Invented educational example models

#### Scope

This deliverable specifies setup constraints for invented educational example models that can later support mechanics-only demonstrations and fake-rule-pack demonstrations. The examples are documentation and testing aids, not engineering templates.

This setup run does not create actual model files under `examples/models/invented/*`, tutorials outside this deliverable, source code, schemas, protected standards examples, commercial software comparisons, code allowables, code formulas, or professional-reliance material.

#### Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Source basis | Verification approach |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-DEL-11-04-001 | Public educational examples must use invented or original data only and must not contain protected standards content, standards-derived examples, commercial-software examples, proprietary vendor data, code allowables, SIF/flexibility data, or protected dimensional tables. | OPS-K-IP-1/2/3; OPS-K-RULE-1; SOW-033 | Protected-content and provenance review before any future public example is materialized. |
| R-DEL-11-04-002 | Future example artifacts must state that they are educational/test fixtures only and are not suitable for engineering reliance, certification, approval, sealing, or code-compliance claims. | OPS-K-AUTH-1; `docs/DIRECTIVE.md` human authority principle; `docs/TYPES.md` professional boundary | Documentation review verifies no professional reliance or automatic compliance language is present. |
| R-DEL-11-04-003 | Mechanics-only examples must illustrate open mechanics and unit-aware reproducibility without embedding code-specific load combinations, allowables, acceptance formulas, or standards interpretations. | OPS-K-DATA-1/2; OPS-K-UNIT-1; `docs/SPEC.md` loads and stress recovery sections | Future example review checks unit labels, provenance fields, and absence of code-specific defaults. |
| R-DEL-11-04-004 | Fake-rule-pack demonstrations must use fictional labels and non-engineering placeholder values and must not approximate realistic design-code formulas, allowables, or pass/fail criteria. | OPS-K-RULE-1/3; `docs/SPEC.md` rule-pack evaluator section | Future rule-pack demo review checks fictional notices, checksum/provenance metadata, and no protected rule content. |
| R-DEL-11-04-005 | Missing solve-required, rule-check-required, or provenance information in future examples must be explicit as `TBD` or a visible finding, never a silent default. | OPS-K-DATA-2; OPS-K-AGENT-1/2 | Future review checks example manifests for explicit unresolved fields and no invented hidden defaults. |
| R-DEL-11-04-006 | Future examples used for regression or validation support must distinguish mechanics verification from code compliance and professional approval. | OBJ-008; `docs/SPEC.md` V&V mechanics; `docs/AGENTIC_DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` review checklist | Future validation handoff checks state that examples are original or invented and are not compliance evidence. |
| R-DEL-11-04-007 | This setup session must write only inside the DEL-11-04 deliverable folder and must not move artifacts to `ISSUED`. | User sealed brief; OPS-K-AGENT-3/4 | Final file list and git status are scoped to the deliverable folder. |

#### Standards

No standards-body formulas, code text, tables, examples, allowables, acceptance rules, or protected interpretations are included in this setup artifact. Any future example that requires code-specific material must use user-supplied private data or a lawfully redistributable source with documented rights and human review.

#### Example Families

| Family | Allowed setup intent | Exclusions |
|---|---|---|
| Mechanics-only invented examples | Demonstrate open centerline mechanics concepts, unit handling, diagnostics, reproducibility, and auditable inputs using invented toy data. | No code-specific combinations, allowables, protected equations, standards examples, or professional reliance. |
| Fake-rule-pack demonstrations | Demonstrate the user-rule-check workflow with fictional rule names, fictional required inputs, fake thresholds, checksums, and notices. | No realistic code formulas, no protected rule text, no material allowable tables, no claim that a result is code compliant. |

#### External Inputs

| Input | Required from | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical model/schema structure | DEL-02-01 and DEL-02-05 | Needed before future actual example model files are materialized outside this setup folder. |
| Rule-pack schema and invented rule-pack example boundary | DEL-06-01 and DEL-06-05 | Needed before future fake-rule-pack demonstration files are materialized. |
| Mechanics benchmark and validation expectations | DEL-09-01 and related validation work | Needed before examples are promoted as regression or validation fixtures. |
| Protected-content/report lint expectations | DEL-08-05 and governance review | Needed before future examples or tutorials are published as public repository artifacts. |

#### Verification

For this setup run, verification requires:

- four-document kit exists in the DEL-11-04 folder;
- `_SEMANTIC.md` and `_SEMANTIC_LENSING.md` exist and preserve lens-not-authority language;
- `Dependencies.csv` validates against the v3.1 schema;
- `_DEPENDENCIES.md` summarizes the same active dependency rows as `Dependencies.csv`;
- `_STATUS.md` reaches `SEMANTIC_READY` only after semantic, lensing, P3, and dependency gates pass;
- no actual example files, tutorials outside this deliverable, source code, schemas, repo-level files, or `ISSUED` artifacts are created;
- no protected standards examples, commercial software examples, realistic code allowables/formulas, or professional-reliance claims are introduced.
