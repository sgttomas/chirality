# Chapter 9 — Discussion

---

## 9.1 Introduction

The preceding chapters presented a philosophical framework, a technical architecture, an epistemic transparency system, a regulatory mapping, a systems engineering analysis, and a working implementation. This chapter assesses the contributions honestly: what was demonstrated, what was not, what the limitations are, how the work generalizes, and what remains for future investigation.

## 9.2 Limitations

### 9.2.1 No Controlled Empirical Validation

The most significant limitation of this work is that the Chirality architecture has not been validated through a controlled empirical study with practicing engineers. The thesis demonstrates that the architecture satisfies the structural requirements of APEGA's professional practice standards, and that it has been implemented as working software with an indexed agent suite and a registered deterministic toolset. However, it does not present empirical evidence that:

- Licensed professionals find the epistemic labeling and provenance mechanisms effective for thorough review in practice
- The review time for AI-assisted work products is measurably reduced compared to unstructured AI outputs
- The invariant system prevents the categories of failure it is designed to prevent (hallucination propagation, silent conflict resolution, scope creep beyond declared write zones) at rates that are statistically significant
- The gate-controlled workflow model is accepted by practitioners as a workable balance between control and productivity

An empirical validation would require a controlled study in which licensed engineers review AI-assisted deliverables — some produced under the Chirality governance framework, some without it — and the accuracy, completeness, and efficiency of their review is measured. Such a study is a natural next step but is beyond the scope of this thesis.

### 9.2.2 Regulatory Interpretation, Not Endorsement

The mapping of the Chirality architecture to APEGA §3.1.1 (direct supervision and control) and §3.1.2 (thorough review) presented in Chapter 6 is a regulatory interpretation by the firm, not a ruling by APEGA. APEGA's guidance on AI tools ("Guidance for Registrants Regarding the Use of Artificial Intelligence Tools," first published July 2025; updated March 23, 2026) addresses registrant conduct — professional responsibility, due-diligence verification of AI results, and competence as a precondition of use — and does not address system architecture or the application of the *Relying on the Work of Others* standard to AI agents. The interpretation — that AI agents are "others" whose work the professional relies on, and that the professional's obligations are defined by what the professional must do rather than by the nature of the worker — is a defensible and conservative reading, but it has not been tested in a disciplinary proceeding or judicial review.

Other interpretations are possible. A regulator might argue that AI agent outputs are not "work prepared by others" but rather "outputs of a tool," which would shift the regulatory framing from §3.0 (Relying on the Work of Others) to the more general obligation to verify tool accuracy under §3.1.2.1. APEGA's AI guidance in fact leans toward this framing: it directs registrants to treat AI results "no differently than results from software, calculators, or lookup tables." The firm's "others" classification is deliberately the more demanding posture — it satisfies the guidance's due-diligence obligations and adds the full supervision-and-review structure on top. The Chirality architecture would satisfy the tool-verification obligation as well, but the conceptual framing would differ. The firm has chosen the "others" interpretation because it is more conservative — it imposes the full suite of supervision and review obligations, not just tool verification — and because the nature of LLM-based agents (judgment-like behavior, natural language interaction, content generation) is structurally more analogous to work prepared by a person than to output from a deterministic calculation tool.

### 9.2.3 Jurisdiction-Specific Regulatory Framework

The regulatory mapping in Chapter 6 is specific to Alberta (APEGA) and the *Engineering and Geoscience Professions Act*. While the structural argument — that professional obligations are defined in terms of what the professional must do, not what the worker is — should generalize to any jurisdiction that defines professional responsibility through supervision and review, the specific practice standards cited (`Relying on the Work of Others and Outsourcing`, `Authenticating Professional Work Products`) are APEGA instruments. Other jurisdictions have their own regulatory frameworks (Chapter 2, §2.4), and the mapping would need to be re-established for each.

### 9.2.4 Instruction-Level Enforcement

The invariant system (R1–R17, I1–I10, K-*) is enforced primarily through agent instruction text and deterministic tools, not through a verified runtime enforcement engine. The enforcement map in `CONTRACT.md` §2 distributes enforcement across layers: agent instructions (design-time), deterministic runtime checks (the TASK shell's path containment, K-WRITE-2), ORCHESTRATOR (runtime), the DOMAIN_ENGINE profile layer, human review (gate), governance audits, and future tooling (automated). The "agent instructions" layer depends on the LLM following its instruction text — a soft constraint, not a hard one.

This is an honest limitation. An LLM may deviate from its instructions. The architectural response is defense in depth: agent instructions are the first layer, but write scope quarantine limits the blast radius of any deviation, human gates catch deviations before they reach authenticated status, and audit agents (AUDIT_AGENTS, AUDIT_DECOMP, AUDIT_DEP_CLOSURE) detect non-conformance after the fact. The system does not claim that instruction-level enforcement is sufficient alone. It claims that the multi-layer enforcement model contains failures to manageable scope.

The "future tooling" enforcement layer — automated checks for staleness calculation (K-STALE-1), content validation (K-VAL-1), merge policy (K-MERGE-1), and approval integrity (K-AUTH-2) — is specified but not yet fully implemented. This means that some invariants currently depend on human review discipline rather than automated enforcement.

### 9.2.5 LLM Capability Evolution

The architecture is designed for the current generation of large language models and their known limitations (hallucination, lack of intrinsic epistemic warrant, inconsistent instruction following). As model capabilities evolve, some architectural constraints may become more or less relevant:

- If future models achieve reliable provenance tracking natively, the mandatory provenance invariant (K-PROV-1) would become redundant as an architectural enforcement but would remain valuable as a verification check.
- If future models achieve near-zero hallucination rates, the no-invention rule (K-INVENT-1) and epistemic labeling would become less operationally important but would not become incorrect — the architecture would simply flag fewer items.
- If future models reliably follow instructions, the instruction-level enforcement layer would become more trustworthy, but the defense-in-depth model (human gates, audit agents, write quarantine) would remain necessary for professional practice because the stakes of failure are not reduced by lower probability alone.

The architecture's longevity depends on the invariant structure remaining
valid regardless of model capability. The thesis claims that the invariants
express professional obligations—not model limitations—and therefore remain
relevant even as models improve. Better models may produce fewer TBDs and
ASSUMPTION labels; the architecture still requires detected uncertainty to be
represented within its declared coverage.

### 9.2.6 Over-Proceduralization and the Displacement of Attention

*Subsection added 2026-07-24.*

The preceding limitations concern enforcement and validation. A further
limitation concerns attention. The architecture multiplies records —
statuses, labels, warrants, receipts, findings, snapshots — and records of
this kind are instruments: in Polanyi's terms, subsidiaries the practitioner
attends *from* while the work itself remains focal [CITE:Polanyi1975].
Polanyi's account carries a warning that applies directly: explicitation
destroys integrated meaning when the particulars become the object of
attention, and a governance architecture is a standing invitation to exactly
that displacement. The failure mode is not generic bureaucracy but a specific
epistemic inversion: process artifacts become what the practitioner looks
*at*, and the engineering reality recedes to the periphery — the same failure
Chapter 6 describes as treating gates as boxes to check (§6.9.4) and §9.3.5
identifies at the authentication gate as capability stress. The architecture
carries partial mitigations — generated harness output may not claim
acceptance in its own voice (§6.8.3), review effort is proportioned to
represented uncertainty (§5.7), and the audit trail is generated as a
byproduct of normal work rather than as a parallel documentation task
(§6.7.5) — but the orientation of attention itself is not architecturally
enforceable. Like the review discipline of §9.2.4, it is a practice
obligation the architecture can support and evidence but cannot compel.

---

## 9.3 Generalizability

### 9.3.1 Across Engineering Domains

The architectural patterns — write quarantine, epistemic labeling, gate-controlled workflows, invariant contracts — are domain-independent. The thesis demonstrates them in the context of EPC and design-build engineering, but the same patterns could govern AI agents producing:

- Regulatory compliance documentation
- Medical device design history files
- Environmental impact assessments
- Financial audit working papers
- Legal contract review deliverables

Any domain where a qualified professional must take responsibility for work and where the evidence trail must support that responsibility is a potential application domain. The four-pillar framework (ontology, epistemology, praxiology, axiology) provides a checklist for assessing whether a given domain's governance needs are fully addressed.

### 9.3.2 Across Regulatory Jurisdictions

The APEGA regulatory mapping generalizes in structure if not in specific citations. The argument — that existing "relying on the work of others" frameworks can govern AI agent use without new AI-specific regulation — should apply wherever professional regulation defines supervision and review obligations in terms of what the professional does. Chapter 2, §2.4 surveyed regulatory approaches in British Columbia (EGBC), Ontario (PEO), the United States (NSPE, ASCE), Australia, and the United Kingdom, finding that none had yet mapped AI agent governance to existing "relying on others" frameworks. The Chirality mapping may serve as a reference for other jurisdictions.

### 9.3.3 The Four-Pillar Framework as an Evaluation Lens

The ontology/epistemology/praxiology/axiology framework could serve as an evaluation instrument for other AI agent governance architectures. For any system, one could ask: Does it define a complete ontology? Does it enforce epistemic transparency? Does it bound agent praxis through formal constraints? Does it articulate and enforce values? A system missing any pillar has a specific, identifiable governance gap. This evaluation use extends beyond the Chirality architecture itself.

The deeper insight — that the four pillars provide a compact and useful ontology for professional accountability (Chapter 3, §3.5) — suggests that this evaluation framework is not arbitrary. It is plausibly portable wherever a professional takes responsibility for work, because the four questions (what exists? what is warranted? how was it done? what values governed?) recur across accountable practice even if different domains instantiate them differently.

The lens is deliberately non-exhaustive. It tests whether four recurring
accountability questions have been addressed; it does not constrain every
category through which a situated knower may understand the work.

### 9.3.4 The Epistemic Ontology and Warrant Lifecycle as Portable Concepts

The six epistemic primitives (claim, warrant, status, gap, conflict, ruling) and the warrant lifecycle (UNWARRANTED → CITED → REVIEWED → AUTHENTICATED) are not Chirality-specific constructs. They formalize concepts that are implicit in any professional review process. An engineer reviewing a colleague's calculation already thinks in terms of claims (what is asserted), warrants (what evidence supports it), gaps (what is missing), and conflicts (where sources disagree). The Chirality contribution is to make these implicit concepts architecturally explicit and enforceable.

Any AI agent framework that aims to support professional practice could adopt the epistemic ontology without adopting the full Chirality architecture. The primitives and the warrant lifecycle are modular — they require only that the system can attach provenance to claims, label epistemic status, surface gaps, and detect conflicts. The AUDIT_EPISTEMIC agent (`AGENT_AUDIT_EPISTEMIC.md`) demonstrates that these properties can be audited systematically.

This portability concerns information governance, not a portable definition
of knowledge. The primitives expose claims, grounds, and workflow status so
that knowers can assess them and accountable actors can record reliance.

### 9.3.5 Capability-Invariance of the Authority Boundary

*Subsection added 2026-07-01.*

The preceding subsections argued that the architecture generalizes across domains and jurisdictions. A third axis of generalization deserves explicit statement: the architecture generalizes across model capability, because the authority boundary is indexed to accountability-status, not to capability. Nothing in the invariant catalog (Appendix A) conditions on how capable a model is. Write scopes attach to roles — the Agent 0/1/2 runtime hierarchy of Chapter 4 (§4.5) — gates attach to positions in the deliverable lifecycle (`SPEC.md` §3.3), and the REVIEWED → AUTHENTICATED transition attaches to being a continuant who can be held to account, a status that no capability level confers. No capability level crosses the boundary, and no capability level renegotiates it. This distinguishes the architecture from capability-indexed governance regimes — autonomy levels, evaluation-gated permission sets, trust tiers — which must be re-litigated at every model generation and which convert each capability gain into a fresh governance argument. The invariance holds in both directions: a degraded or cheaper model requires no amendment either — the gates and the evidence trail simply catch more. The seeds of this argument are already present in the corpus: the authority typing of Chapter 4 asks what a role may write, never how capable the agent is, and the reliance standard mapped in Chapter 6 (§6.3) never conditions the professional's obligations on the competence of the relied-upon party.

A monotonic-benefit implication follows. Because the gates were never
justified by machine incapability — Section 9.2.5 already argued that the
invariants express professional obligations, not model limitations —
capability gains improve drafting, checking, evidence capture, and conflict
detection without automatically reallocating authority. The philosophical
resource for this stability is Smith's reckoning/judgment distinction,
calibrated in Chapter 3 (§3.6.4) [CITE:Smith2019]. Improved information can
change what a person knows and reduce review effort; it does not by itself
perform an attributable act of professional reliance.

The thesis does not need to decide whether a future artificial system could
be a knower or accountable continuant. The current professional and
operational allocation is unambiguous: only authorized humans issue binding
approval records and assume duty of care. Any future reallocation would
require its own regulatory and governance act; it is not implied by model
capability or by this explanatory account.

Collins's taxonomy of tacit knowledge sharpens the same boundary from the
side of acquisition [CITE:Collins2010]. The strong, collective kind of tacit
knowledge is acquired through socialization into a form of life — a route
that is not a capability parameter, and for which, in Collins's phrase, "we
know of no way" to make machines that possess it. The formulation matters for
the invariance claim: the authority boundary is indexed to answerability — a
status conferred and held to account by institutions — rather than to
judgment as a capacity whose presence would have to be re-litigated at each
model generation. Stated this way, the boundary survives even the
epistemically cautious reading of Collins: whether or not some future system
could in principle be socialized into accountable practice, the reallocation
would be an institutional act, as the preceding paragraph requires, not an
emergent property of capability.

One caveat is required, and it is the same caveat that runs through this thesis (§6.9.4, §9.2.4). The structure is capability-invariant; the practice at the gate is capability-stressed. As agent outputs improve, the temptation to rubber-stamp them grows, and the architecture cannot compel the professional's commitment to be real — it can only record whether its trace exists. Rising capability therefore makes drift measurement and honest accounting of review effort more important, not less: the better the drafts, the more the integrity of the gate depends on review discipline that the architecture can evidence but cannot enforce.

The claim is falsifiable, and the repository itself is the longitudinal test. Capability-invariance predicts that the invariant catalog requires zero capability-triggered amendments across model generations — only the tooling around it evolves, as §9.2.5 anticipated. A future model improvement that forces a change to a K-* invariant would falsify the claim.

### 9.3.6 Relationship to the AI Alignment Problem

*Subsection added 2026-07-02.*

The generalization argument extends to a problem usually framed at the model
level. Most alignment work asks how to make a model produce behavior
consistent with human values — through training, feedback, or specification
[CITE:Ouyang2022] [CITE:Bai2022]. The governance problem this thesis
addresses is adjacent but distinct: how to prevent machine output from being
mistaken for accountable judgment. The Chirality response aligns the system
of use, not the model. Whatever the model is internally — however it was
trained, and however capable it becomes — its outputs enter professional
practice only through provenance, epistemic labels, review, gates, and a
recorded human commitment.

The two approaches are complementary, and the architectural approach
addresses only its own class of failure. Model-level alignment reduces the
rate of undesirable outputs; use-level alignment ensures that no output,
good or bad, acquires professional authority without an attributable act by
an accountable person. Nothing in this thesis makes a model intrinsically
truthful, corrigible, or safe under arbitrary deployment — §9.2.4 and §9.2.5
state those limits. As Chapter 3 (§3.6.6) argues, integration does not erase
the accountability gap. Smith's reckoning/judgment distinction (§3.6.4)
[CITE:Smith2019] remains a philosophical resource for preserving the
difference between producing information and accepting responsibility for
reliance on it.

### 9.3.7 Convergent Practice: Large-Project Delivery as Prior Art

*Subsection added 2026-09-19. Agent-drafted (Claude Fable 5.1) from an
observation the owner made in a working session and from that session's
record. It cites no sources yet and is therefore UNWARRANTED in the sense of
`docs/TYPES.md` §10.4; candidates for a verified pass are named at its end.*

The literature this thesis reviews approaches the problem from agent
architectures, LLM reliability, safety-critical software, professional
regulation and epistemology (Chapter 2). It does not review the body of
practice that has the longest record of solving the underlying problem:
the delivery of large capital projects, in which complex, interdependent
work is carried out by many distinct agents — human ones — and a named
professional answers for the result. The owner's observation (recorded verbatim in
`plans/evidence/2026-09-19_owner_words_four_graph_structures.md`) is that the
structures Chirality makes explicit are the structures that practice already
converged on, and that this is the stronger warrant for the claim that they
belong to knowledge work as such rather than to this system.

The correspondence is direct. Section 4.3.4 describes two of four structures,
the ANCHOR tree and the EXECUTION DAG. The owner's fuller account has four,
each answering a question no other answers:

| Structure | Question | In this architecture | In project delivery practice |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tree (structure and working memory) | What is this made of? | The decomposition; the deliverable folder and its minimum fileset (§4.3.3) | The work breakdown structure and its dictionary: every work package with its scope, basis, references, interfaces, acceptance criteria and responsible organization |
| Directed acyclic graph (production and dependencies) | What must come before what? | EXECUTION-class edges; the session work graph; one worktree per concurrent line of work | The logic-tied network schedule |
| Network (topic query and long-term memory) | What bears on what, and who decided it? | Decision registers, rulings, owner-direction records, provenance (Chapter 5) | Document control: the decision log, technical queries and their answers, deviations and concessions, transmittals recording who issued what, at which revision, superseding what |
| Attention (decomposition and synthesis) | How does all of this become one thing? | The model with files, tools and instructions; the decomposition workflows | Front-end definition: scoping, basis of design, constructability review, the sanction-stage estimate breakdown |

Two readings of the dependency graph, which the owner's sketch states as
"blocker sub-set analysis is execution sequencing truth" and "full graph
closure = audit truth" (transcribed in
`plans/evidence/2026-09-19_owner_words_four_graph_structures.md`), are likewise
standing practice: the activities whose predecessors and constraints are
released, prioritized by float, tell a superintendent what to do this week,
and the fully closed network is what a planner or a claims analyst audits. The remaining machinery maps as
closely. Independent review by a fresh context is the inter-discipline check and
independent design verification. The scope-change workflow is management of
change. A validation level set per item by its consequence, never lowered by
whoever performs the work, and recorded with the acceptance, is the hold and
witness point of an inspection and test plan set by quality or safety class.
Letting production run ahead of the decomposition and reconciling afterwards
resembles what construction practice does when it records field deviations
and reconciles the drawings afterwards: a planned phase with a known cost and
not a lapse of discipline, though as-built records capture departures from an
existing design basis and do not by themselves license work ahead of
definition. The authentication gate (§6.5.5) is the engineer of record's
stamp.

Three differences are what make the architecture necessary rather than
redundant. First, forgetting is total. Project institutions carry much of
their structure tacitly, in people who remain; an agent has no tacit memory,
so everything the institution leaves implicit must be written or it does not
exist. The architecture is not a different structure for agents but the same
structure made fully explicit, which human delivery has never had to do.
Second, the economics of attention invert. In human delivery, synthesis is
scarce and checking is comparatively cheap; with agents, synthesis is
abundant and the scarce resource is the accountable professional's
understanding. The structures are unchanged, but the design pressure moves to
the acceptance edge, which sharpens the concern of §9.2.6 and §9.3.5: the quality of such a system can be stated, in a sentence the owner adopted
in session (`plans/evidence/2026-09-19_owner_words_four_graph_structures.md`), as how
much warranted confidence it produces per unit of the accountable person's
attention, with a validation level setting how much of that confidence a
given piece of work requires.
Third, the failure modes coincide. A work-package dictionary nobody reads, a
schedule that is not updated while the project runs from the weekly meeting,
a decision whose approver cannot be found, a scope decomposed without
consulting lessons learned: each has an exact counterpart in agent work, and
in the session from which this subsection derives an agent committed three of
the four in one day (a deliverable folder used as a log, a work graph left
stale while the state ran in handoff prose, and an agent's inference recorded
as the owner's direction), each traceable to one of the first three
structures; no failure of the fourth was observed. That the observed failures
sorted by structure is consistent with the structures being properties of the
work rather than habits of the workers, but the sorting was performed by the
same account that posits the four structures, and one session cannot
distinguish the two explanations.

The correspondence also locates the contribution. Software practitioners who
arrive independently at agent hierarchies, worktrees and dependency traversal
recover the mechanics without the accountability layer, because in software
accountability is largely collective and reversible. Practitioners of project
delivery hold that layer and, so far, mostly use language models as drafting
aids rather than as participants in the management system. The architecture
is built from the acceptance edge backwards, which is why its rules concern authority, provenance and claims. Whether they
held when the owner deliberately relaxed prescribed procedure in the
implementation work of September 2026 is not settled here; the same session
produced the failures described above.

Two limits follow. The system's own vocabulary is a third language, spoken
fluently by neither community; the translation in the table above is likely
to be the more effective introduction for a project engineer, who already
believes the part that is hardest to teach. And the architecture has so far
been exercised by a single accountable professional, who stands at every
acceptance and steering edge. That is a constraint on throughput and an untested assumption (§9.4.8). A
third limit is the basis of this subsection itself. It rests on one project
and one working session, and both the correspondence table and the
classification of that session's failures were written by the agent that made
the errors described; neither was checked against a record of practice or by
a practitioner other than the owner.

*Sources to be added in a verified pass; none is cited here and no specific
claim above rests on one:* the project-management and cost-engineering bodies
of knowledge on work breakdown structures and network scheduling; the
construction-industry research on front-end planning; quality-management
standards on quality plans and inspection and test plans; process-safety
practice on management of change; and document-control practice in capital
projects.

## 9.4 Future Work

### 9.4.1 Empirical Validation

The highest-priority future work is a controlled study with licensed engineers evaluating AI-assisted deliverables produced under the Chirality framework. The study design should measure:

- Review accuracy (do reviewers catch more errors with epistemic labels than without?)
- Review efficiency (is review time reduced?)
- Review confidence (do reviewers report higher confidence in their assessment?)
- Practitioner acceptance (is the gate-controlled workflow considered workable?)

### 9.4.2 Runtime Enforcement Engine

The "future tooling" enforcement layer should be implemented as automated checks: staleness calculation from the dependency graph and baseline SHAs, content validation against approved SHAs, merge policy enforcement, and approval integrity verification. This would close the gap between the specified invariant system and the implemented enforcement. (At the monorepo root, the `write_status.sh` transition guard and the practitioner harness's `status`/`drift`/`self-check` commands, built under D-GOV-01..08, are a first slice of this direction.)

### 9.4.3 Empirical Validation of the Warrant Lifecycle

The warrant lifecycle model (UNWARRANTED → CITED → REVIEWED → AUTHENTICATED) and the AUDIT_EPISTEMIC agent that operationalizes it should be empirically validated. Specific questions include: does the warrant state distribution correlate with deliverable quality? do deliverables with higher CITED/REVIEWED ratios produce fewer review findings? does the AUDIT_EPISTEMIC agent's conflict detection catch errors that manual review misses? These questions require data from real project executions.

### 9.4.4 Formal Verification of Invariant Preservation

The invariant system could be subjected to formal verification: given the write scope declarations, the gate structure, and the lifecycle state machine, can it be proven that no sequence of agent actions violates the K-* invariants? This is a formal methods contribution that would strengthen the safety argument.

### 9.4.5 Multi-Jurisdiction Regulatory Mapping

The APEGA mapping should be replicated for other jurisdictions (EGBC, PEO, NSPE, Engineers Australia, UK Engineering Council) to validate the generalizability claim and to identify jurisdiction-specific requirements that the architecture may need to accommodate.

### 9.4.6 Multi-User Concurrent Execution

The current architecture assumes sequential agent execution within a single user session. Multi-user concurrent execution — multiple licensed professionals directing agents against the same project simultaneously — would require a lock mechanism (identified as future hardening candidate 5 in Chapter 8, §8.6.3) and conflict resolution protocols for concurrent write operations.

### 9.4.7 Extension to Other Agent Platforms

The governance architecture is currently coupled to the Chirality desktop application and its specific agent runtime. Demonstrating that the same invariant system, write scope model, and epistemic architecture can govern agents on other platforms (e.g., LangChain, AutoGen, Claude Code) would validate the claim that the contribution is architectural, not implementation-specific.

### 9.4.8 A Second Accountable Professional, Outside Software

*Subsection added 2026-09-19. Agent-drafted (Claude Fable 5.1).*

The claim of §9.3.7 is about knowledge work as such, and the architecture has
been exercised by one accountable professional, largely on software. The most
informative available test is a second accountable professional working a
loop, ideally from project delivery and ideally on work that is not software
(a proposal, an investigation, a calculation package), without the owner
translating. The observations of interest are whether the four structures and
their failure signatures appear unprompted, how much of that professional's
attention each unit of warranted confidence costs, and whether the
validation-level setting is usable by someone who did not design it. Either
outcome would be informative. This differs from §9.4.6, which concerns
concurrent execution; the question here is whether the structures are
recognized and relied upon by a practitioner other than their author.

---

## 9.5 Summary

The Chirality architecture is a complete, working implementation of an SE-governed AI agent system for professional engineering practice. Its limitations are honest: no controlled empirical validation, a regulatory interpretation not yet tested by a regulator, jurisdiction-specific framing, instruction-level enforcement that depends on multi-layer defense in depth, and evolution uncertainty as models improve. Some of its patterns appear structurally portable — especially the epistemic architecture, write quarantine, and governance-first framing — but that portability should be treated as a hypothesis to be tested rather than as a settled conclusion. The most important future work is empirical validation — demonstrating that the epistemic architecture measurably improves the quality and efficiency of professional review.
