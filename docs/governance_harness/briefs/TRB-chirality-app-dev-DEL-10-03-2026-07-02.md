# Tranche brief TRB-chirality-app-dev-DEL-10-03-2026-07-02 — HUMAN_ADOPTED

- tranche_id: `TRB-chirality-app-dev-DEL-10-03-2026-07-02`
- state: HUMAN_ADOPTED
  - lifecycle: CANDIDATE → HUMAN_ADOPTED → EXECUTED → CHECKED → HUMAN_REVIEWED → CLOSED/SUPERSEDED
  - (brief lifecycle is metadata on harness artifacts only — never the deliverable lifecycle)
- objective: Close or annotate the open result-schema TBDs in this deliverable's working
  files (Specification.md:19,43,44,48,62,64,65; Procedure.md:14,15,40,71,81,83,85;
  Datasheet.md:44,54; Guidance.md) by CROSS-REFERENCING the piping operation_applier /
  rule_check_runner Rust result shapes (e.g. OperationOutcome,
  `projects/chirality-piping/core/model_operations/operation_applier/src/lib.rs:118-141`)
  per FM-04 "Genuine gaps to close" (FM-04_OperationProposal_merge.md:54-59). Where a
  piping shape is unpublished as a standalone schema, record a precise piping file:line
  pointer and leave the residual TBD explicit — cross-reference, never invent
  (K-INVENT-1). Optional in-fence: repair the INSP-03-flagged status-history wording
  (Assessment_INSP-03_DEL-10-03.md:37,52) — wording only, no state advance. _STATUS.md
  stays CHECKING; work recorded as WORKING_ITEMS agent decisions (D-APP-45 conformance
  pattern). Doc-only; no fence crossing.
  - source: practitioner-proposed 2026-07-02 from the cited files; owner may amend at adoption
- adopted_by: Ryan Tufts
- adopted_on: 2026-07-02
  - adoption provenance: owner adoption directed in-session 2026-07-02 ("Both are
    adopted"); metadata recorded by agent at owner direction. The adoption act is the
    owner's (K-AUTH-1; D-GOV-04); this record binds to the publication commit (K-AUTH-2).

## stop_conditions

- an out-of-scope write attempt (outside write_scope or into prohibited_paths)
- conflicting current-truth discovered — stop and surface it per K-CONFLICT-1; never resolve silently
- a human decision point reached (see human_decision_points)

## human_decision_points

- adoption of this brief itself (human edits state to HUMAN_ADOPTED and commits; D-GOV-04)
- any CHECKING or ISSUED lifecycle advance — human-only (SPEC §3.3)

## adoption

Adoption is a human act (D-GOV-04); the harness never performs any of these steps and never flips this brief's state:

- a human edits `state:` above to HUMAN_ADOPTED
- the same human fills `adopted_by:` (must match `docs/governance_harness/human_actors.md`) and `adopted_on:`
- the file is moved to a governed path OUTSIDE `_harness_generated/` — the generated root is gitignored scratch; an adoption there does not exist for reliance (D-GOV-04)
- the file is committed — adoption binds to committed content at the publication commit (K-AUTH-2); check with `brief --verify-adoption <path>`

---

HUMAN_ADOPTED brief — an enforceable fence upon commit to the governed record (D-GOV-04; K-AUTH-2 binds to the publication commit); the cited sources govern on any disagreement.

Finding severities: none
