## Recorded ruling

The owner aligned the behavior in-session on 2026-08-02:

<!-- BEGIN OWNER RULING VERBATIM -->
Require the survey whenever TASK_MANAGEMENT is already invoked; do not require loops to invoke TASK_MANAGEMENT.
<!-- END OWNER RULING VERBATIM -->

The owner then directed implementation of the bounded plan named above. The
managed run persists both acts at
`execution/_Coordination/AgentRuns/TM-FEDERATION-SURVEY-20260802/HUMAN_DIRECTION.md`.
On 2026-08-02 the owner subsequently directed, verbatim, "Merge via PR."
That act satisfies H2 publication direction and authorizes merge of this
validated tranche through its exact pull-request HEAD after required checks;
it does not authorize a direct `main` push or check bypass.

## Decision

Whenever `TASK_MANAGEMENT` is invoked for a loop with a canonical Task
Management register, the invoked instance must first perform a read-only
federation survey of every canonical Git-tracked Task Management register.
The survey reports its coverage before the requested mode and then the
manager continues under its existing authority.

This is an invocation-local requirement on an already-invoked manager. It is
not a standing loop sweep, loop-entry reader binding, schedule, workflow gate,
CI task, daemon, or requirement that any loop invoke `TASK_MANAGEMENT`.

## Effects

1. `agents/AGENT_TASK_MANAGEMENT.md` carries the mandatory preflight,
   `COMPLETE`/`PARTIAL` semantics, Root/global and non-Root/relevant
   presentation behavior, and a manual read-only fallback when the helper is
   unavailable.
2. `tools/taskmgmt/taskmgmt.py` gains a deterministic `federation` command
   that discovers tracked registers in sanctioned shapes, validates them,
   constructs typed-field relationships, and writes a rebuildable projection
   beside the invoking register.
3. The projection is derived, gitignored, rebuildable, and never authority.
   Its observations create no duty, disposition, approval, scope, lifecycle,
   schedule, or closure effect.
4. Every survey preserves register hashes. No receiving row is automatically
   created and no foreign register is written.
5. A `PARTIAL` or operational result prohibits a global-absence or global-
   closure claim; it does not bind or stop unrelated development-loop work.

## Relationship to D-GOV-32 and K-TM-4

D-GOV-32 remains the adoption record for the accepted Task Management PRD and
K-TM-1..6. K-TM-4 graceful absence still means that no act anywhere may
require Task Management to be invoked. D-GOV-33 distinguishes that rejected
standing obligation from the complete receive-side survey required after the
owner or loop has already chosen to invoke the manager.

The adopted PRD bytes and `docs/CONTRACT.md` are not edited. This record
carries the later owner interpretation and implementation direction.

## Scope limits

This ruling does not:

- amend any `LOOP_INIT.md`, standing workplan, register row, schema column,
  adopted PRD byte, or CONTRACT invariant;
- schedule or automatically invoke `TASK_MANAGEMENT`;
- create CI, daemon, event-bus, broker, or App-runtime integration;
- grant foreign-register writes, automatic row creation, or semantic
  disposition authority;
- create product, decomposition, deliverable, dependency, lifecycle, release,
  or professional-reliance effects; or
- authorize any publication route other than the owner-directed, checked PR
  merge of this bounded tranche.

## Publication posture

This ruled record is part of the bounded candidate tranche. H2 is satisfied by
the owner's 2026-08-02 direction, "Merge via PR." Its implementation becomes
shared repository state only when CHANGE publishes the exact validated source
HEAD, observes required check verdicts, and merges that HEAD through the PR.
`CandidateSHA`, `PublicationSHA`, and `EffectiveSHA` stay `TBD` until their
respective Git acts; no record invents or self-cites a commit that does not yet
exist.
