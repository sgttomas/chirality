"""G3 — pre-dispatch root work-graph check (D-GOV-21 §5.3, mechanisms M1/M2).

Deterministic guard shipped by the D-GOV-21 guard-capability tranche (packet
§6 step 6) and wired into governance-harness CI. It verifies, before dispatch,
that each active node's write targets are declared, that concurrently active
nodes' targets are disjoint or serialized per M1, and that instruction-surface
intersection carries the M2 marker. The first accepted work graph is
instantiated later, by root Project Setup (packet §6 step 8); this tranche
ships capability only.

Design of record (state surface, schema, marker convention, modes)
------------------------------------------------------------------
State surface: `{REPO_ROOT}/execution/_harness/work_graph.yaml`, co-located
with G0's `root_guards.yaml`, G1's `adapter.yaml`, and G2's
`surface_ownership.yaml`. Schema id: `root-work-graph/v1`. All paths are
repo-root-relative POSIX paths or globs. Shape::

    schema: root-work-graph/v1
    accepted_basis: <commit sha>     # M3 frozen instruction basis for the graph
    nodes:
      - id: N1
        status: active              # active | pending | complete | blocked
        owner: PKG-01_Example       # optional: owning G2 register entry
        write_targets:
          - execution/PKG-01_Example/**
        depends_on: [N0]            # optional
        serialized_after: [N0]      # optional explicit M1 serialization edges
        integration_owner: ""       # optional: the single declared integration
                                    # owner for an overlapping target
        m2_marker: "M2:docs/governance_harness/tranche_manifests/<ID>.yaml"

**M2 marker convention (defined here).** The marker is the string field
`m2_marker`, whose value is `M2:<repo-relative path>` naming the tranche
manifest (G4's surface) that records the M2 gate for the instruction-surface
touch. It is REQUIRED on any node — and on any run brief — whose declared
write targets intersect the instruction surface, and the named path must
exist. The marker records that a gate was taken; it does not grant
authorization, and no deterministic marker ever could (K-AUTH-1).

**Modes.**

- *CI mode* (no arguments): if the work-graph surface is absent, PASS idle. If
  it exists, validate its internal consistency (schema, unique ids, known
  statuses, resolvable dependency references, no dependency cycle, declared
  and repo-relative write targets on every non-complete node, active-node
  disjointness-or-serialization, M2 markers). When the G2 register exists, a
  node declaring `owner` must have its targets covered by that register entry
  (M1 tie-in); when the register is absent that cross-check is skipped and
  reported as not applicable, never assumed.
- *Dispatch mode* (`--work-graph PATH --brief PATH [--brief PATH ...]`):
  everything CI mode checks, plus, for each named run brief: the brief's node
  exists and is `active`; every write target the brief declares is covered by
  that node's declared targets (undeclared write target → BLOCK); the brief
  carries the M2 marker if its targets intersect the instruction surface; and
  the dispatched set is pairwise disjoint-or-serialized against every other
  active node. A brief is a `.yaml`/`.yml` mapping or a Markdown file whose
  first block is YAML front matter delimited by `---` lines; a brief with no
  machine-readable dispatch block is a BLOCK, never a guess.

Behavior (severity semantics per D-GOV-02): exit 0 PASS, exit 1 BLOCK, exit 2
operational error (PyYAML unimportable, unusable arguments, unreadable file).
A dependency cycle is BLOCK and is reported as an unresolved ordering that
must be resolved by a recorded move per the `AGENTS.md` cycle-resolution rule;
this guard never linearizes a cycle itself.

Observation boundary
--------------------
The work graph's and briefs' recorded fields, the existence of paths those
fields name, and (when present) the G2 register's declared targets. It does
not observe running processes, git state, or any other working root; the
"concurrently active" relation is read from declared `status`, not detected.
This guard holds no authority and confers none (K-AUTH-1).

Registration entry it will assert in `execution/_harness/root_guards.yaml`
(written by root Project Setup, never by this tranche)::

    guards:
      G3:
        registered: true
        status: passing
