"""G4 — instruction-surface tranche manifest check (D-GOV-21 §5.3, M2/M6).

Deterministic guard shipped by the D-GOV-21 guard-capability tranche (packet
§6 step 6) and wired into governance-harness CI. Each accepted root tranche
that changes protected instruction-surface paths must carry a tranche manifest
declaring those changes; this guard verifies manifest presence, schema
validity, path coverage of an actual diff, and the recorded M2 gate and M6
notice disposition for the tranche.

**It checks recorded provenance; it never infers origin from a diff.** The
authorization, integration owner, merge gate, and notice disposition are read
as recorded fields. A diff is used only to ask whether the changed
instruction-surface paths are covered by a declared manifest — never to
attribute authorship, to infer that a change was authorized, or to synthesize
a manifest. A manifest records that a gate was taken; it grants nothing
(K-AUTH-1).

Design of record (manifest format and location)
-----------------------------------------------
Location: `docs/governance_harness/tranche_manifests/<TRANCHE_ID>.yaml`, one
file per tranche, filename stem equal to `tranche_id`. Schema id:
`instruction-tranche-manifest/v1`. All paths are repo-root-relative POSIX
paths or globs. Shape::

    schema: instruction-tranche-manifest/v1
    tranche_id: ROOT-LANE-B-20260725
    title: Guard capability G1-G4
    date: 2026-07-25
    basis: <commit sha>            # optional: the basis the tranche was cut from
    instruction_surface_paths:     # every protected path the tranche changes
      - tools/validation/validate_root_harness_adapter.py
      - .github/workflows/governance-harness.yml
    m2_gate:
      authorization: <verbatim or cited independent owner authorization>
      authorized_by: <human actor of record>
      authorization_date: 2026-07-25

      merge_gate: human-gated-pr   # the only accepted value

                                   # complete owner_direction block is
                                   # recorded (PRD annex 5.3.1, D-GOV-31 as
                                   # simplified by owner direction 2026-07-29)
      owner_direction:             # optional owner direction of record
        directed_by: <owner of record>
        direction_date: 2026-07-29
        approved_source_sha: <full 40-hex pre-merge pin of the approved HEAD>
    m6_notice:
      disposition: pending         # pending | routed | none-required
      routed_to: []                # notice paths; required when routed
      rationale: <why this disposition>

Declared paths are NOT required to exist: a tranche may delete a path. Paths
that do not intersect the instruction surface are recorded as over-declaration
(INFO, non-blocking). `disposition: pending` is lawful and PASSes with an INFO
note — the M6 routing decision is completed by the accepting agent at fan-in,
and this guard records rather than pre-empts that act.

`m2_gate.self_merge: false` remains the schema default and the unconditional
requirement absent an owner direction. Under the D-GOV-31 merge-gate policy
as simplified by owner direction of 2026-07-29 (PRD annex §5.3.1),
`self_merge: true` is lawful ONLY when the manifest records a complete
`m2_gate.owner_direction` block naming the directing owner, the direction
date, and the full 40-hex `approved_source_sha` pre-merge pin. The direction
itself lives in the loop's ordinary closeout evidence — receipts, plus the
PR and merge SHAs Git already keeps. `self_merge: true` without a complete
owner_direction block is BLOCK — the preserved failing mode; an incomplete
or malformed block is BLOCK; a complete block with `self_merge: true` PASSes
with an INFO line naming the directing owner and date. The block is recorded
provenance: this guard verifies it is named and well-formed, never that the
direction itself was lawful (K-AUTH-1).

The instruction surface is `docs/SPEC.md` §0.2.1's enumeration as amended by
D-GOV-26: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `agents/`, `skills/`, `tools/`, root
`docs/`, `init/`, `.github/workflows/`. `CLAUDE.md` is the session-init
instruction pointer importing `AGENTS.md`; `.github/workflows/` holds the CI
workflow definitions that gate merges, and had previously been guarded on the
Lane B characterization in
`execution/_Coordination/WORKPLAN_2026-07-25_root_product_development.md`.

Modes and behavior (severity semantics per D-GOV-02)
----------------------------------------------------
- *CI mode* (no arguments): the manifest directory must exist and hold at
  least one manifest, and every manifest in it must be schema-valid. An absent
  or empty directory is BLOCK — the discipline must not be silently emptied.
  (This is the G4 discipline applied to itself: this tranche's own manifest
  lives there and is checked by every CI run.)
- *Diff mode* (`--base REF --head REF [--tranche ID]`): computes
  `git diff --name-only <base>..<head>`, filters to instruction-surface paths,
  and BLOCKs on any changed instruction-surface path not covered by a declared
  manifest path (all manifests by default, or one named `--tranche`).
- *Candidate-range diff mode* adds `--added-manifests-only`: schema-validates
  the whole manifest corpus as usual, but accepts path coverage only from
  manifest files added in the named diff. This is the governed CI mode: an old
  manifest, whether unchanged or modified, cannot stand in for the candidate
  tranche's required new manifest.
- Exit 0 PASS, exit 1 BLOCK, exit 2 operational (PyYAML unimportable, git
  unavailable or refs unresolvable, unusable arguments).

Observation boundary
--------------------
Manifest files' recorded fields, the existence of notice paths a manifest
declares as routed, and — in diff mode only — the file-name list of a git
diff between two named refs. No commit content, no authorship, no other
working root.

Registration entry it will assert in `execution/_harness/root_guards.yaml`
(written by root Project Setup, never by this tranche)::
